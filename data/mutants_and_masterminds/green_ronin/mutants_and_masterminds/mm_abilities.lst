Attractive			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Advantage.Skill Advantage.Ranked		PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,AdvantageCost_Attractive			PREVARLT:AttractiveCount,2		DEFINE:AttractiveCount|0	DESC:You're particularly attractive, giving you a +2 circumstance bonus on Deception and Persuasion checks to deceive, seduce, or change the attitude of anyone who finds your looks appealing. With a second rank, you are Very Attractive, giving you a +5 circumstance bonus. This bonus does not count as part of your regular skill bonus in terms of the series power level, but also does not apply to people or situations which (in the GM's opinion) would not be influenced by your appearance. While superheroes tend to be a fairly good-looking lot, this advantage is generally reserved for characters with particularly impressive looks.

Your total attack bonus is still limited by power level. This advantage best suits characters with a level of overall close combat skill (armed and unarmed). For capability with a particular type of attack, use the Close Combat skill.

Benefit			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Advantage.General Advantage.Ranked	PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,AdvantageCost_Benefit														DESC:You have some significant perquisite or fringe benefit. The exact nature of the benefit is for you and the Gamemaster to determine. As a rule of thumb it should not exceed the benefits of any other advantage, or a power effect costing 1 point (see Feature in the Powers chapter). It should also be significant enough to cost at least 1 power point. An example is Diplomatic Immunity (see Sample Benefits). A license to practice law or medicine, on the other hand, should not be considered a Benefit; it's simply a part of having training in the appropriate Expertise skill and has no significant game effect. Benefits may come in ranks for improved levels of the same benefit. The GM is the final arbiter as to what does and does not constitute a Benefit in the setting. Keep in mind some qualities may constitute Benefits in some series, but not in others, depending on whether or not they have any real impact on the game.

Make a skill check as a standard action against your target's resistance check (the same skill, Insight, or Will defense, whichever has the highest bonus). If you win, your target is dazed (able to take only a standard action) until the end of your next round. The ability to Daze with Deception and with Intimidation are separate advantages. Take this advantage twice in order to be able to do both.

Defensive Roll		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Advantage.Combat Advantage.Ranked		PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,AdvantageCost_Defensive Roll													DESC:You can avoid damage through agility and "rolling" with an attack. You receive a bonus to your Toughness equal to your advantage rank, but it is considered an active defense similar to Dodge and Parry (see Active Defenses in the Abilities chapter), so you lose this bonus whenever you are vulnerable or defenseless. Your total Toughness, including this advantage, is still limited by power level. This advantage is common for heroes who lack either superhuman speed or toughness, relying on their agility and training to avoid harm.

Equipment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Advantage.General Advantage.Ranked	PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,AdvantageCost_Equipment														DESC:You have 5 points per rank in this advantage to spend on equipment.

Choose Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion when you acquire this advantage. You can also use Fascinate with an appropriate Expertise skill, like musician or singer, at the GM's discretion. You are subject to the normal guidelines for interaction skills, and combat or other immediate danger makes this advantage ineffective. Take a standard action and make an interaction skill check against your target's opposing check (Insight or Will defense). If you succeed, the target is entranced. You can maintain the effect with a standard action each round, giving the target a new resistance check. The effect ends when you stop performing, the target successfully resists, or any immediate danger presents itself. Like all interaction skills, you can use Fascinate on a group, but you must affect everyone in the group in the same way. You may take this advantage more than once. Each time, it applies to a different skill.	STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																COST:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.84

Only a natural 20 is an automatic hit, however, and an attack that misses is not a critical. Each additional rank applies to a different attack or increases your threat range with an existing attack by one more, to a maximum threat range of 16-20 with 4 ranks.

Improvised Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Advantage.Combat Advantage.Ranked		PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,AdvantageCost_Improvised_Weapon													DESC:When wielding an improvised close combat weapon- anything from a chair to a telephone pole or entire car- you use your Close Combat: Unarmed skill bonus for attack checks with the "weapon" rather than relying on your general Close Combat skill bonus. Additional ranks in this advantage give you a +1 bonus to Damage with improvised weapons per rank.

Once per scene, by taking a standard action and spending a hero point, allies able to interact with you gain a +1 circumstance bonus per Inspire rank on all checks until the start of your next round, with a maximum bonus of +5. You do not gain the bonus, only your allies do. The inspiration bonus ignores power relevel limits, like other uses of hero points. Multiple uses of Inspire do not stack, only the highest bonus applies.

Languages			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Advantage.Skill Advantage.Ranked		PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,AdvantageCost_Languages														DESC:You can speak and understand additional languages. With one rank in this advantage, you know an additional language. For each additional rank, you double your additional known languages: two at rank 2, four at rank 3, eight at rank 4, etc. So a character with Languages 7 is fluent in 64 languages! Characters are assumed to be fluent in any languages they know, including being able to read and write in them.

You can do this a number of times per game session equal to your Luck rank, with a maximum rank of half the series power level (rounded down). Your Luck ranks refresh when your hero points "reset" at the start of an adventure.

This minion is an independent character with a power point total of (advantage rank x 15). Minions are subject to the normal power level limits, and cannot have minions themselves. Your minions (if capable of independent thought) automatically have a helpful attitude toward you. They are subject to the normal rules for minions (see page 193). Minions do not earn power points. Instead, you must spend earned power points to increase your rank in this advantage to improve the minion's power point total and traits. Minions also do not have hero points. Any lost minions are replaced in between adventures with other followers with similar abilities at the Gamemaster's discretion.

Precise Attack		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Advantage.Combat Advantage.Ranked		PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,AdvantageCost_Precise_Attack		PREVARLT:PreciseAttackCount,4		DEFINE:PreciseAttackCount|0	DESC:When you make close or ranged attacks (choose one) you ignore attack check penalties for cover or concealment (choose one), although total cover still prevents you from making attacks.

Greed				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication.Motivation																									DESC:There are those motivated by nothing more than the opportunity to make a profit off their heroic careers. They may be mercenaries for hire or marketing machines who do good deeds but also rake in the proceeds from licensing fees and public appearances. More altruistic heroes tend to look down upon their profit-mongering peers.																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Justice			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication.Motivation																									DESC:An overwhelming thirst for justice drives some heroes, a need to see the innocent protected and the guilty punished, even if they are beyond the reach of the law. These heroes walk a thin line. For some justice becomes a thirst for vengeance for injury done to the hero in the past, like the death of a loved one.																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Patriotism			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication.Motivation																									DESC:Heroes are often devoted to the ideals of their home (or adopted) nation, and seek to serve that nation and its people with their abilities. Patriotic heroes are often honored as champions of their homelands, but it is the service, and not necessarily the recognition, that matters.																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Recognition			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication.Motivation																									DESC:Some heroes just want recognition or attention, and dressing up in a bright costume and fighting crime is one surefire way to get people to notice you. The hero may be a shy nobody out of costume or a glory-hog who loves the spotlight.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Responsibility		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication.Motivation																									DESC:The responsibility of having great power can be a heavy burden but some heroes feel it is their duty to use the powers they've been given for the greater good. Oftentimes these heroes are trying to live up to an ideal like a mentor or a predecessor who inspired them.																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Thrills			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication.Motivation																									DESC:For some the life of a superhero is all about excitement, thrills, danger, and challenge. These heroes are in it for the action more than anything else.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.27

# MOTIVATION AND INFLUENCE
Accident			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You cause or suffer some sort of accident. Perhaps a stray blast damages a building or hurts an innocent bystander, your fire powers set off sprinkler systems, or you cause volatile chemicals to explode. A hero with this as a regular complication may be especially accident-prone, inexperienced with their powers, or even jinxed! The GM decides the effects of an accident, but they should be troublesome. Accidents can lead to further complications; perhaps the hero develops a guilt-complex, obsession, or phobia involving the accident.																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Addiction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You need something, whether for physical or psychological reasons. You'll go out of your way to satisfy your addiction, and being unable to satisfy it may lead to other complications, either involving your own faculties or your relationships with people. Several comic book heroes have struggled with various addictions and the effects on their lives.																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Disability			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You are limited by a particular disability, such as being blind, deaf, or paraplegic. When your disability places serious challenges in your path, your complication comes into play. Many "disabled" heroes have powers or other compensations for their disabilities, such as a blind hero with other enhanced senses or a paraplegic who is a powerful psychic with matchless mobility of mind over body. Even though their powers sometime make up for their disability, this complication is still appropriate because they may have to deal with it from time to time.																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Enemy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You have an enemy, or enemies, trying to do you harm. The GM can have your enemy show up to cause you trouble, and adventures involving your enemy tend to be more complicated for you; even personal grudge-matches, if the enmity goes both ways. When having an enemy causes a particular problem for you (such as your enemy abducting a loved one or laying a trap for you), you get a hero point.																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Fame				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You're a public figure, known almost everywhere you go, hounded by the media, swamped by fans and well-wishers, and similar problems, which create various complications.																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Hatred			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You have an irrational hatred of something, leading you to actively oppose the object of your dislike in some way, no matter the consequences. Complications involving your hatred tend to overwhelm your better judgment.																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Honor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You have a strong personal code of honor. Generally this means you won't take unfair advantage of opponents or use trickery, but you can define the exact terms of your code with the GM. Your honor becomes a complication when it puts you in a bind or on the horns of a moral dilemma.																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Identity			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:Heroes often maintain secret identities, creating various complications as they try to keep them secret from friends and enemies alike. The dual-identity can even go beyond mere disguise for heroes who actually transform into a different persona, creating complications around controlling that transformation, or a lack of powers or abilities in one persona.																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Obsession			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You're obsessed with a particular subject and pursue it to the exclusion of all else, which can create quite a few complications.																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Phobia			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You're irrationally afraid of something. When confronted with it you have to fight to control your fear, causing you to hesitate, flee, or act irrationally.																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Power Loss			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:Certain circumstances cause some or all of your powers to fail or stop working, or rob you of them altogether. You might depend on particular objects others can steal or take from you, or lose your powers during the dark of the moon, or when exposed to exotic radiation. You may even simply lose faith in yourself, resulting in temporary weakness.   When this happens, and poses a challenge for you, your complication comes into play.																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Prejudice			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You are part of a minority group subject to the prejudices of others, which create problems. Similarly, characters with unusual origins or appearance might face prejudice, such as a demonic-looking hero who is considered suspect. Some Gamemasters and gaming groups may prefer not to deal with issues of prejudice in their games, in which case the GM is free to ban this complication.																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Quirk				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:Complications can often come from various personality quirks: likes, dislikes, hobbies, neuroses, and so forth. For example, a hero might have the quirk of always leaving some sort of "calling card" for the authorities along with a captured criminal. That could become a complication if somebody else starts imitating it, or uses it to cause trouble for the hero.																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Relationship		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:The important people in a hero's life are a source of strength, but they can also complicate matters considerably. If they are not in on the hero's costumed identity, then there is juggling two lives and keeping loved ones safely in the dark. On the other hand, if the people in a hero's life do know the truth, they are in danger from the hero's foes and others seeking to find out.																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Reputation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You have a bad reputation, affecting what others think of you (whether you deserve it or not). Having someone adopt a bad attitude toward you because of your reputation is a complication. You might struggle to overcome your reputation, taking chances or facing difficulties others do not as a result.																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Responsibility		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You have various demands on your time and attention. Responsibilities include family obligations, professional duties, and similar things. Failing to live up to your responsibilities can mean loss of relationships, employment, and other problems.																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Rivalry			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You feel a strong sense of competition with a person or group and have to do your best to outdo your rival at every opportunity.																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Secret			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Complication																											DESC:You have something potentially damaging or embarrassing you're hiding from the world. The most common secret for Mutants &amp; Masterminds																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.29

Affliction			SORTKEY:Affliction															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+AfflictionPowerCost	DESC:You can impose some debilitating condition or conditions on a target by making a close attack. You set the conditions your Affliction causes at each degree when you acquire it and they may not be changed. Higher degree conditions replace lower degree conditions and do not stack with them. See the possible conditions for each degree under the Affliction Resistance Check table.

Burrowing			SORTKEY:Burrowing															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+BurrowingPowerCost	DESC:You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel behind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Burrowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank. Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you begin burrowing each new tunnel). Note that Burrowing differs from the Permeate effect of Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing it at all (see Movement for details).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-1+BurrowingPowerCost		COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Movement	ASPECT:Action|Free	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Duration|Sustained	ASPECT:Cost|1 point per rank
Communication		SORTKEY:Communication														CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,4+CommunicationPowerCost	DESC:You can communicate over a distance using a medium other than your normal voice. Choose a sense type as your Communication medium (see the list of examples). You may also use a special sense type (like neutrinos, gravitons, magical sendings, and so forth) noticeable only to an appropriate form of the Detect effect (see Senses in this chapter), at the GM's discretion. � Visual: laser or fiber optic link � Auditory: ultrasonic or infrasonic beam, "ventriloquism" � Olfactory: pheromones or chemical markers � Tactile: vibratory carrier wave � Radio: AM, FM, and short-wave radio bands, microwaves � Mental: telepathic transmission, psychic link, mystical sending Your rank determines you maximum Communication range. Communication is instantaneous with any subject within your range. The recipient of your communication must be within range and have a means of receiving your transmission (super-sense, or a receiver of some sort; conscious awareness is all that's needed to "receive" Mental Communication). You can receive Communication of the same medium as your own. Receivers can choose to ignore your Communication, if they wish. Communication is language- dependent; you and the subject must share a common language (see Comprehend to communicate across language barriers). Your Communication is point-to-point (sent to a single receiver within your range). Activating your Communication effect is a free action. Communicating, however, takes the normal amount of time. You can apply the Rapid modifier to speed things up, provided your recipient is capable of receiving communication at that speed. Others with an acute sense able to detect your Communication medium can "tap into" your transmissions with a Perception check (DC 10 + your Communication rank). The eavesdropper must be within normal sensory range of you or the receiver. With two degrees of success on the check, the eavesdropped can also understand your transmissions. Effects like Concealment and Dazzle that target your Communication medium can "jam" or block your transmissions.

Area				SORTKEY:Communication			KEY:Communication ~ Area						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can broadcast omni-directionally to every receiver within your maximum Communication range at once. Note this extra is only strictly necessary to communicate with everyone over a wide area all at once; since using and maintaining Communication are free actions, the GM may allow a communicator to establish and maintain contact with multiple discrete receivers-such as the members of the same team-all in the same round. +1 cost per rank.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															BONUS:VAR|CommunicationPowerCost|1					COST:0
Dimensional			SORTKEY:Communication			KEY:Communication ~ Dimensional					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra				PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1					DESC:Communication with this modifier can bridge dimensional barriers, reaching into other dimensions and planes of existence. The Communication effect still has its proximate range, and the GM may rule certain subjects "out of range" of the effect, depending on their relative positions in the other dimension. Flat +1 point.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-1						COST:0
Rapid				SORTKEY:Communication			KEY:Communication ~ Rapid						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra				PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1					DESC:Your communication occurs 10 times faster than normal speech. Each additional rank increases communication speed by a factor of 10. This is useful for high-speed computer links, "deep sharing" psychic rapports, and so forth. Flat +1 point.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-1						COST:0
Selective			SORTKEY:Communication			KEY:Communication ~ Selective						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:If you have the Area extra, you can choose which receiver(s) within range get your Communication, excluding everyone else. This allows you to go from a single receiver (point-to-point) to all potential receivers in range (omni-directional) or anywhere in between. +1 cost per rank.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				COST:0
Subtle			SORTKEY:Communication			KEY:Communication ~ Subtle						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra				PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1					DESC:Your Communication cannot be "overheard" (it is encrypted, scrambled, or otherwise protected). With 2 ranks, your Communication cannot even be detected (that is, no one can even tell you are transmitting, much less what you're saying). Flat +1 or 2 points.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE	BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-1						COST:0
Limited			SORTKEY:Communication			KEY:Communication ~ Limited						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Communication may be limited to only members of a particular group, such as a species, family, members of an organization, and so forth. This is in addition to limitations imposed by medium (that is, requiring subjects to have a means of picking up on the Communication). -1 cost per rank.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		COST:0
Sense-Dependent		SORTKEY:Communication			KEY:Communication ~ Sense-Dependent					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Communication itself is already sense-dependent (in that the subject(s) must be able to sense your communication medium to pick up your transmissions) and so cannot have this flaw. However, other perception range effects can be Communication- Dependent, meaning you must be in communication with your subject for them to work (using your Communication medium as a "carrier" for the other effect). If your Communication is blocked in any way, the other effect doesn't work. -1 cost per rank.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	COST:0

Comprehend			SORTKEY:Comprehend													CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+ComprehendPowerCost	DESC:You can comprehend different sorts of communication.

#	EXTRA
Animals			SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Animals						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can either speak to or comprehend animals. You can ask questions and receive answers, although animals are not any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while especially stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you. For 2 ranks you can both speak to and understand the "speech" of animals.
Languages			SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Languages						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can either speak or understand the language of any intelligent creature. You can speak only one language at a time, although you can comprehend multiple languages at once. This effect does not enable you to speak with creatures that don't possess a language. For 2 ranks you can both speak and understand all languages. For 3 ranks anyone able to hear you can understand what you're saying, regardless of language. Being able to also read any language you comprehend requires 1 additional rank.
Languages (Read)		SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Languages (Read)					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can either speak or understand the language of any intelligent creature. You can speak only one language at a time, although you can comprehend multiple languages at once. This effect does not enable you to speak with creatures that don't possess a language. For 2 ranks you can both speak and understand all languages. For 3 ranks anyone able to hear you can understand what you're saying, regardless of language. Being able to also read any language you comprehend requires 1 additional rank.
Machines			SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Machines						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can communicate with electronic devices, making inquiries and understanding their replies. This requires two Comprehend ranks. Most are limited by their programming and peripherals in terms of what they "know," and may not be able to answer some inquiries with anything other than an "unknown" or "not found." At the GM's discretion, you can use the Technology skill as an interaction skill when communicating with machines.
Objects			SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Objects						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can communicate with inanimate objects, granting them the ability to speak to you or simply "reading" impressions from them. This requires two Comprehend ranks. Objects only "know" about events directly affecting them or occurring in their immediate area. Gamemasters can apply the guidelines for Postcognition (see page 126) to this effect.
Plants			SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Plants							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can communicate with plants, both normal plants and plant creatures. This requires two Comprehend ranks. A plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity.
Spirits			SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Spirits						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can communicate with incorporeal and normally invisible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or certain extradimensional entities, depending on the context of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as a "medium" of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly understood by denizens of the spirit world, as well. At the GM's discretion, this effect may extend to undead creatures, demons, or other supernatural entities, depending on the setting.
Spirits (Understood)	SORTKEY:Comprehend			KEY:Comprehend ~ Spirits (Understood)				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can communicate with incorporeal and normally invisible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or certain extradimensional entities, depending on the context of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as a "medium" of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly understood by denizens of the spirit world, as well. At the GM's discretion, this effect may extend to undead creatures, demons, or other supernatural entities, depending on the setting.

Concealment			SORTKEY:Concealment													CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+ConcealmentPowerCost	DESC:You gain total concealment from a particular sense while this effect is active, although you are still detectable to other senses (even other senses of the same sense type; so you could have full concealment against normal sight, but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense type). Each additional rank gives you concealment from another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an entire sense type. See Concealment on page 101 for the full effects. Concealment from visual senses costs double (2 ranks for one visual sense, 4 ranks for all visual senses). You cannot have concealment from tactile senses, since that requires being incorporeal (see the Insubstantial effect). So with Concealment 5, you can have total concealment from all visual senses (4 ranks) and normal hearing (1 rank), for example. With Concealment 10 you have total concealment from all sense types other than tactile.

Area				SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Area							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Concealment with Affects Others (previously) or Attack (immediately following) may have this extra, affecting everything in the area. To only affect some targets in the area, apply the Selective modifier as well. +1 cost per rank.
Attack			SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Attack						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC: Use this extra for a Concealment effect you can impose on others (whether they want to be concealed or not). An invisibility ray, for example, is a Visual Concealment Attack, while a field of darkness is a Burst Area Visual Concealment Attack. +0 cost per rank.
Precise			SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Precise						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC: You can vary your Concealment at will as a free action: going from total to partial to no concealment, concealing some parts and not others, or anywhere inbetween. If your Concealment affects multiple senses, you can also choose to affect some of those senses and not others. Concealment is normally all-or-nothing: either you are concealed to the full amount of your effect, or you're not. Flat +1 point.

Blending			SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Blending						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC: You "blend" into the background. Your Concealment only functions as long as you move no faster than your (ground speed rank -1), since your blending can't adapt faster than that. -1 cost per rank.
Limited			SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Limited						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC: Your Concealment only works under certain conditions, such as in fog, shadows, or in urban locales. One example is Limited to Machines, where your Concealment only fools senses with a technological descriptor. -1 cost per rank.
Partial			SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Partial						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC: Your effect provides partial rather than total concealment (see Concealment, page 101, for details). -1 cost per rank.
Passive			SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Passive						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC: Your Concealment only lasts until you do something requiring an attack or effect check on your part, at which point it stops working until you reactivate it, which you may do on the following round. -1 cost per rank.
Resistible			SORTKEY:Concealment			KEY:Concealment ~ Resistible						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC: Your Concealment offers a resistance check (chose a defense when the flaw is applied) for anyone aware of your presence and actively looking for you. Concealment Resistible by Will may represent some sort of mental illusion effect. -1 cost per rank.

Create			SORTKEY:Create													CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+CreatePowerCost		DESC:You can form solid objects essentially out of nowhere. They may be made of solidified energy, "hardened" water or air, transmuted bulk matter, ice, stone, or some other medium, depending on the effect's descriptors. You can form any simple geometric shape or common object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk, etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular object is too complex for this effect. Generally, your objects can't have any moving parts more complex than a hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent, as you choose when you use the effect, limited by your descriptors and the Gamemaster's judgment. You can create an object with a maximum volume rank equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your effect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will by using your effect again (essentially "re-creating" the object). Your created objects are stationary once you have created them, although other effects can move them. Assume a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.

Innate			SORTKEY:Create			KEY:Create ~ Innate							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Continuous or Permanent Create with this modifier makes objects that cannot be nullified, they're essentially "real" objects for all intents and purposes (although the user can "unmake" them at will unless the effect is also permanent). Flat +1 point.
Movable			SORTKEY:Create			KEY:Create ~ Movable							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can move your created objects around with a Move Object effect at your Create rank (see Move Object in this chapter for details). +1 cost per rank.
Precise			SORTKEY:Create			KEY:Create ~ Precise							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can create more precise and detailed objects. The exact parameters of Precise Create are up to the GM, but generally, you can create objects with moving parts, and considerable detail. Flat +1 point.
Selective			SORTKEY:Create			KEY:Create ~ Selective							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can make your created objects selectively "transparent" to attacks, blocking some while allowing others (yours and your allies', for example) to pass through them. You can also selectively make your objects solid to some creatures and incorporeal to others, such as allowing one person to walk through a created wall, while blocking another. It takes a free action to change the selective nature of an object; permanent created objects cannot have their selectivity changed once they are created. +1 cost per rank.
Stationary			SORTKEY:Create			KEY:Create ~ Stationary							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Your created objects can hang immobile in the air. They resist being moved with a Strength rank equal to the modifier rank.

You cannot repair permanent created objects or otherwise alter them once they're created. +0 cost per rank (for a Sustained effect).
Proportional		SORTKEY:Create			KEY:Create ~ Proportional						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Your created objects have a total volume rank plus Toughness rank equal to your Create rank, rather than both volume and Toughness up to your rank.

Action			SORTKEY:Damage			KEY:Damage ~ Action							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Because it requires the defend action, Deflect cannot take less than a standard action. To create a kind of "deflection field" or similar effect that automatically deflects attacks over a wide area, use an Enhanced Dodge and/or Enhanced Parry effect with modifiers like Area and Selective.
Reflect			SORTKEY:Damage			KEY:Damage ~ Reflect							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can reflect attacks back at the attacker as a free action. First, you must successfully deflect the attack, then make a normal attack check using your own attack modifier to hit with the reflected attack. It has its normal effect if it hits. +1 cost per rank.
Redirect			SORTKEY:Damage			KEY:Damage ~ Redirect							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can redirect attacks you successfully deflect at any target within the attack's normal range, as Reflect, above. You must have the Reflect extra to take this one. +1 cost per rank.

Deflect			SORTKEY:Deflect													CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+DeflectPowerCost		DESC:You can actively defend for characters other than yourself, deflecting or diverting attacks against them at a distance, and may be able to more effectively defend yourself, depending on your rank. See the Defend action in the Action &amp; Adventure chapter for details. You use your Deflect rank in place of an active defense. You still add 10 to a Deflect die roll of 10 or less, for a minimum roll of 11. Deflect modifiers are limited by power level. Like a ranged attack, if you Deflect at medium range, you have a -2 circumstance modifier on your check. At long range, you have a -5 circumstance modifier. Range is measured from you to the target of the attack you are deflecting. Like the defend action, Deflect does not work against area effects or perception ranged attacks, nor versus attacks targeting defenses other than Dodge or Parry.

Elongation																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+ElongationPowerCost	DESC:You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your reach. Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to determine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized human (size rank -2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2, and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles! "Snapping back" to your normal shape is a free action. You can use Elongation to make "close" attacks at a greater distance by elongating your limbs. Once elongated, you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a standard action. If you can't accurately sense your target (you're elongating around a corner, for example), apply the rules for concealment (see Concealment in the Action &amp; Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a +1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by PL).

Enhanced Trait															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,4+Enhanced_TraitPowerCost	DESC:You can temporarily improve one of your existing traits, chosen when you take this effect. While this effect is active, you increase the affected trait by its rank. So, for example, Enhanced Strength 5 increases your Strength by +5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be below the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement to accommodate it. The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquiring a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait, and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

A limit that rarely comes into play-like losing your Enhanced Trait during a new moon-can be handled as a power loss complication. See Complications in The Basics chapter for details. -1 cost per rank.
Permanent			SORTKEY:Enhanced Trait			KEY:Enhanced Trait ~ Permanent					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:At no change in cost, your Enhanced Trait may be a permanent improvement, rather than a sustained effect. The primary difference is that your permanent enhancement cannot be turned on and off and cannot be improved by extra effort, including using it to perform power stunts (see Extra Effort). There is no action to use a Permanent Enhanced Trait, as it is always active. +0 cost per rank.
Reduced Trait		SORTKEY:Enhanced Trait			KEY:Enhanced Trait ~ Reduced Trait					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:One or more of your traits is lowered while others are enhanced. This flaw is worth as many points as the reduction in the affected trait(s). So, for example, if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the value of the lost Intellect ranks as the value of the flaw. As with all flaws, the effect must still cost at least 1 power point. Flat -points equal to the lowered trait.

Environment																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+EnvironmentPowerCost	DESC:You can change the environment in an area: raising or lowering the temperature, creating light, causing rain, and so forth (see The Environment in the Action &amp; Adventure chapter for details). Your Environment affects a 30 foot radius around you at rank 1. Each additional rank moves the radius up one distance rank, for a reach of approximately 2,000 miles at rank 20, sufficient to alter the environment of an entire continent! Each of the following is a separate Environment effect. If you have one you can acquire others as Alternate Effects, but you can then only use and maintain one at a time. To use or maintain multiple Environment effects simultaneously, add their costs together for the effect's total cost per rank or apply the Selective modifier, allowing you to mix-and-match effects.

#
Extra Limbs																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+Extra_LimbsPowerCost	DESC:You have extra manipulative limbs, such as arms, tentacles, or even prehensile hair or a tail. Each rank in this effect grants you an extra limb. Extra Limbs do not allow you to take additional actions in a round, although they do provide the benefits of the Improved Grab advantage-grabbing with some of your limbs and leaving others free. All additional limbs except your dominant limb are considered your "off-hand." If you have the Benefit (Ambidexterity) advantage, you have no off-hand penalties with any of your limbs. If you apply all of your limbs to a grab attempt (rather than taking the option to leave some of them free), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus per rank in Extra Limbs to a maximum of +5, much like a team check (see page 16).

Continuous						KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Continuous						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Continuous Extra Limbs are a power effect you can turn on and off at will, but that remain until you choose to deactivate them, even if you are stunned or incapacitated . +1 cost per rank.
Projection						KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Projection						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Your Extra Limbs are merely a projection of your power rather than an extension of your body. Therefore, any harm directed specifically against your Extra Limb(s) has no effect. So, for example, one of your additional limbs could reach into a container of acid or a blast furnace to pull out an object without any harm to you. The GM may require Extra Limbs with this extra to modify their duration to continuous or sustained, but this is not essential. It's likely Extra Limbs with this extra are not eligible for the Innate modifier. +1 cost per rank.
Sustained						KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Sustained						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Sustained Extra Limbs can be turned on or off (growing or forming the additional limbs and then making them disappear just as easily), but the limbs disappear or stop working if you are unable to continue the effect. +0 cost per rank.
#	FLAW
Distracting						KEY:Extra Limbs ~ Distracting						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Coordinating the actions of your multiple limbs is difficult, so you are vulnerable while applying any extra limbs to an action. This flaw should generally not apply to any creature with Innate Extra Limbs, especially if they are part of its natural physiology. -1 cost per rank.

Feature																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+FeaturePowerCost		DESC:You have one or more minor features, effects granting you an occasionally useful ability, one per rank. This effect is essentially a version of the Benefit advantage (see page 82) but a power rather than a virtue of skill, talent, or social background. For example, diplomatic immunity or wealth are Benefits; fur, the ability to mimic sounds, or a hidden compartment in your hollow leg are Features. It's up to the GM what capabilities qualify as Features; generally, if something has no real game effect, it's just a descriptor. If it has an actual game system benefit, it may be a Feature. There's no need to define every possible Feature a character may have down to the last detail. Some Features may be sustained duration rather than permanent with no change in cost. This suits active Features a character has to use and maintain rather than having them as passive traits requiring no effort whatsoever.

Internal Compartment				KEY:Feature ~ Internal Compartment					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power														DESC:You can carry a portion of your carrying capacity inside your body! You have a pouch or compartment of some sort, able to hold objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).
Iron Stomach					KEY:Feature ~ Iron Stomach						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power														DESC:You can eat anything that's not toxic without ill effects, no matter how unpleasant it may be: spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example.
Mimicry						KEY:Feature ~ Mimicry							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power														DESC:You can imitate almost any sound you've heard, giving you a +10 bonus to Deception checks to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.
Quick Change					KEY:Feature ~ Quick Change						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power														DESC:You can change clothes-such as into or out of your costume-as a free action. With 2 ranks, you can change into any outfit at will.
Special Effect					KEY:Feature ~ Special Effect						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power														DESC:You have some special effect, like a gust of wind at the right dramatic moment, or ideal spotlighting, or personal theme music. The GM may give you a +2 bonus for favorable circumstances when your special effect is likely to impress people or otherwise aid you.
Temporal Inertia					KEY:Feature ~ Temporal Inertia					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power														DESC:You are somehow uniquely "anchored" in the space-time continuum, making you immune to changes in history. You recall the "true" version of historical events, even if no one else does.

Aquatic						KEY:Flight ~ Aquatic							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can move underwater as easily as in the air. You have a water speed equal to your Flight rank, minus 2, subject to the usual rules for swimming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that see Immunity, page 113). This is the Swimming power as an Alternate Effect. Flat +1 point.
Continuous						KEY:Flight ~ Continuous							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Continuous Flight operates even when the user is incapacitated or otherwise unable to sustain it. The user remains hanging in the air, maintaining relative position to the ground, if necessary. Alternately, the user might float safely down to the ground when unable to maintain Flight as a kind of "safety net," your choice when you apply the modifier. +1 cost per rank.
Subtle						KEY:Flight ~ Subtle							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:The default Flight effect is noticeable, whether from the rush of air, the roar of jets, or a glowing contrail or aurora, for example. This modifier reduces, and then eliminates, these traces. If your Flight is completely Subtle, you do not need to make Stealth checks to move silently while flying (you do so automatically), although you may still need to do so to avoid being seen or otherwise detected. Flat +1 or 2 points.

Concentration					KEY:Flight ~ Concentration						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Flight requiring concentration means you can fly, but can't do much else at the same time. -1 cost per rank.
Distracting						KEY:Flight ~ Distracting						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:You are not very maneuverable and therefore vulnerable while flying (see the Vulnerable condition in The Basics chapter). -1 cost per rank.
Gliding						KEY:Flight ~ Gliding							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:You fly by gliding on wind currents. Your maximum gliding distance is limited to the vertical distance rank of your starting height, plus your flight speed rank. You may be able to gain altitude occasionally by catching thermal updrafts and winds at the GM's discretion. Otherwise you must land at the end of your maximum distance. -1 cost per rank.
Levitation						KEY:Flight ~ Levitation							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:You can only move vertically, straight up and down, and not side to side, although you can allow yourself to be carried along in the direction of the wind horizontally. -1 cost per rank.
Platform						KEY:Flight ~ Platform							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Your Flight is reliant on some sort of platform on which you stand or sit. If you fail a resistance check while flying, or you are grabbed by someone standing on the ground, you're knocked or pulled off your platform and cannot fly. You can regain the use of your flying platform by reactivating your Flight effect on your next turn. -1 cost per rank.
Wings							KEY:Flight ~ Wings							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:You have wings that allow you to fly, but they run the risk of being fouled or restrained, which prevents you from flying. If you are immobilized, restrained, or bound, you cannot fly. You can regain the use of your wings by reactivating your Flight effect once you are no longer affected by the aforementioned conditions. -1 cost per rank.

Growth																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+GrowthPowerCost		DESC:You can temporarily increase your size, gaining Strength and Stamina at the cost of becoming a bigger, heavier, less agile target, unable to maneuver through small spaces. Growth modifiers are restricted by power level limits. Each rank of Growth adds 1 rank to your Strength and Stamina (constructs add 1 rank to Strength and Toughness if they lack Stamina) and adds 1 rank to your mass. Every two ranks adds a +1 bonus to Intimidation. Every 8 ranks adds 1 to your Speed. Every rank of Growth subtracts 1 from your Stealth checks. Every 2 ranks (rounded up) subtracts 1 from your Dodge and Parry defenses. Every 4 ranks of Growth increases your size rank by 1 (ordinary humans start out at size rank -2, between 3 and 6 feet tall). So at Growth 8, you have +8 Strength and Stamina, +4 to Intimidation, +1 Speed, but -8 to Stealth, -4 Dodge and Parry, and you are size rank 0 (around 30 feet tall). Increases to your Strength and Stamina also improve related traits like your Strength Damage, Fortitude, and Toughness.

Healing																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+HealingPowerCost		DESC:You can heal Damage conditions by touching a subject and taking a standard action to make a DC 10 Healing check. Each degree of success healing one Damage condition, starting with the subject's worst condition, and working down, as if the subject were recovering rapidly. If the subject is dying, the highest degree of success stabilizes the subject, removing the dying condition. If the Healing check fails, you must wait one minute or use extra effort in order to try again. You can also grant a subject a bonus equal to your Healing rank on resistance checks against effects with disease or poison descriptors. The bonus applies to the subject's next resistance check against the effect. You can use Healing on yourself, provided you are still capable of taking the standard action needed. Healing does not work on subjects unable to recover on their own, such as creatures with no Stamina rank or inanimate objects.

Affects Objects					KEY:Healing ~ Affects Objects						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Your Healing can also "heal" damage to non-living subjects. You make a Healing check against the subject's worst damage condition, as normal. +1 cost per rank.
Area							KEY:Healing ~ Area							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Healing with this extra grants the same benefit to all subjects in the affected area. Area Empathic Healing (see this power's Flaws) is an unwise combination, as the healer takes on all of the damage conditions of the affected subjects at once! +1 cost per rank.
Energizing						KEY:Healing ~ Energizing						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can heal the fatigued and exhausted conditions as well as damage conditions: DC 10, one degree of success for fatigued, two degrees of success for exhausted. However, you take on the removed conditions and cannot use Healing to eliminate your own fatigue (although you can still use hero points to recover from them). If the Healing check fails, you must wait the normal recovery time or use extra effort to try again. +1 cost per rank.
Perception						KEY:Healing ~ Perception						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Applied to Ranged Healing (following), Perception Ranged Healing does not require an attack check to "touch" the subject. +1 cost per rank.
Persistent						KEY:Healing ~ Persistent						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Your Healing can remove even Incurable effects (see the Incurable modifier). Flat +1 point.
Ranged						KEY:Healing ~ Ranged							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Ranged Healing requires an attack check to "touch" the subject with the Healing effect. The GM may waive the check for a willing subject holding completely still, but the subject is defenseless that round, making it an unwise decision in the midst of combat. +1 cost per rank.
Restorative						KEY:Healing ~ Restorative						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Your Healing effect can restore power points removed by Weaken effects with the appropriate descriptors, such as injury, disease, or poison. You restore points equal to your rank to the affected trait(s). +1 cost per rank.
Resurrection					KEY:Healing ~ Resurrection						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can restore life to the dead! If the subject has been dead for fewer minutes than your Healing rank, makes a DC 20 Healing check. If successful, the patient's condition becomes incapacitated, as if just stabilized. If the check fails, you can only try again using extra effort. +1 cost per rank.
Selective						KEY:Healing ~ Selective							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Area Healing may have this extra, allowing you to choose who in the area does and does not gain the benefits. +1 cost per rank.
Stabilize						KEY:Healing ~ Stabilize							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You don't need to make a Healing check to stabilize a dying character, your Healing effect does so automatically, although it still requires the normal standard action. Flat +1 point.
#	FLAW
Empathic						KEY:Healing ~ Empathic							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:When you successfully cure someone else of a condition, you acquire the condition yourself and must recover from it normally. You can use Healing and Regeneration to cure your own conditions. You can have the Resurrection modifier for Healing, but if you successfully use it, you die! This may not be as bad as it seems if you have Immortality, allowing you to return to life (see the Immortality effect for details). -1 cost per rank.
Limited						KEY:Healing ~ Limited							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Examples of ways in which Healing may be Limited include: One Type of Damage (such as energy or bludgeoning damage), Objects (in conjunction with Affects Objects), Others (you can't use Healing on yourself), or Self (you can only use Healing on yourself). -1 cost per rank.
Temporary						KEY:Healing ~ Temporary							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:The benefits of your Healing are temporary, lasting for one hour. The subject then regains any damage conditions you healed. These conditions stack with others the subject acquired since the initial healing, which may result in more severe damage or even death. -1 cost per rank.
#
Illusion																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+IllusionPowerCost		DESC:You can control others' senses to create false impressions, illusions. This can range from visual images to phantom sounds, smells, or even radar or mental images. For 1 point per rank, you can create an illusion affecting a single sense type. For 2 points per rank, you can affect two sense types. For 3 points per rank, you can affect three sense types. For 4 points per rank, you can affect four sense types, and for 5 points per rank, you can affect all sense types. Visual senses count as two sense types. Your rank determines how convincing your illusion is, including the DC for the Insight resistance check (10 + rank).

#	EXTRA
Independent						KEY:Illusion ~ Independent						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Your active illusions only require a free action to maintain, rather than a standard action. +1 cost per rank.
Selective						KEY:Illusion ~ Selective						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You choose who perceives your Illusion and who doesn't. +1 cost per rank.
#	FLAW
Feedback						KEY:Illusion ~ Feedback							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Although Illusion does not have a physical "manifestation" per se, it can apply this flaw, in which case a successful damaging attack on one of your illusions causes you to suffer damage, using the guidelines given in the description of the Feedback flaw. -1 cost per rank.
Limited to One Subject				KEY:Illusion ~ Limited to One Subject				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Only a single subject at a time can perceive your Illusion. -1 cost per rank.
Ranged						KEY:Illusion ~ Ranged							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:It is left to the GM's discretion whether or not Illusion's range can be reduced at all, since being able to perceive the affected area is important in creating and directing the illusion. In order to solely alter your own appearance, see the Morph effect, possibly with the Resistible modifier. -1 cost per rank.
Resistible						KEY:Illusion ~ Resistible						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:Illusions Resistible by Will are typically hallucinatory effects projected into the target's mind. This flaw is commonly combined with Selective, so only the targets you choose perceive your illusions. Illusions Resistible by Fortitude may represent a hallucinatory drug or similar biochemical effect. As usual, targets immune to effects targeting the resistance are unaffected by the illusion as well. So Illusions Resistible by Fortitude or Will have no effect on non-living targets, for example. This resistance check is in addition to the usual Insight check; the first determines if the target can resist the effect creating the illusion, the Insight check determine if the target notices something wrong about the illusion, revealing it as false. -1 cost per rank.
#
Immortality																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+ImmortalityPowerCost	DESC:You can recover from death! If your condition becomes dead, you return to life after a time. Subtract your Immortality rank from a time rank of 19 (one month) to determine how long it takes. So Immortality 11, for example, restores you to life in just 30 minutes (19 - 11 = time rank 8). At rank 20, you recover from death at the start of each action round! When you recover, all your damage conditions are removed, but you also lose all accumulated hero points, starting over with none.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-2+ImmortalityPowerCost		COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Defense	ASPECT:Action|None	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Duration|Permanent	ASPECT:Cost|2 points per rank
#	FLAW
Limited						KEY:Immortality ~ Limited						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:You must specify a reasonably common effect (or set of uncommon effects) that keeps you from recovering from death, such as beheading, cremation, a stake through the heart, and so forth. Even then, if the effect is somehow removed or reversed (e.g. the stake is removed from your corpse) you may still be able to come back. -1 cost per rank.
#
Immunity																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+ImmunityPowerCost																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-1+ImmunityPowerCost			COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Defense	ASPECT:Action|None	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Duration|Permanent	ASPECT:Cost|1 point per rank
#	EXTRA
Affects Others					KEY:Immunity ~ Affects Others						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:This extra allows you to grant the benefits of your Immunity to others by touch. It's most commonly used with life support, such as the power to maintain a life support "bubble" around you. +1 cost per rank.
Sustained						KEY:Immunity ~ Sustained						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Sustained duration Immunity may be suitable for certain types of powers, particularly force fields or similar protective abilities requiring a modicum of concentration. It is a net +0 modifier from Immunity's base permanent duration. +0 cost per rank.
Ranged						KEY:Immunity ~ Ranged							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:Affects Others Immunity may have this extra, allowing it to grant its benefits at range. +1 cost per rank.
Reflect						KEY:Immunity ~ Reflect							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can reflect attacks to which you are immune back at the attacker as a free action. Make a normal attack check using your own attack modifier to hit with the reflected attack. It has its normal effect if it hits. +1 cost per rank.
Redirect						KEY:Immunity ~ Redirect							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra													DESC:You can redirect attacks to which are you are immune at any other target within the attack's normal range, as Reflect, above. You must have the Reflect extra to take this one. +1 cost per rank.
#	FLAW
Limited to Half Effect				KEY:Immunity ~ Limited to Half Effect				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw													DESC:You suffer half the normal effect rather than being entirely immune to it. For environmental effects, you only make checks half as often. For other effects, halve the effect's rank (round down) before determining its resistance check DC, including for things like Impervious. -1 cost per rank.
#
Insubstantial															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,5+InsubstantialPowerCost	DESC:You can assume a less solid form, with each Insubstantial rank becoming progressively less solid. You do not gain the ability to assume lower-ranked Insubstantial forms at higher ranks, but you can acquire a lower-ranked form as an Alternate Effect of a higher-ranked one. You can switch between normal and Insubstantial form at will as a free action once per round. The default is that substantial is your "normal" form, but the GM may permit you to make Insubstantial your "normal" form, in which case remaining solid is a sustained duration for you! Insubstantial offers four ranks of effect:																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-5+InsubstantialPowerCost		COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|General	ASPECT:Action|Free	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Duration|Sustained	ASPECT:Cost|5 points per rank
#
Leaping																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+LeapingPowerCost		DESC:You can make prodigious leaps, far more than even a skilled athlete. Your Leaping rank, minus 2, is the distance rank you cover in a single standing jump: so 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2, up to 1,000 miles at rank 20! You do not suffer any damage from landing after a jump, so long as it is within your maximum distance. The speed rank of your leap maxes out at 7 (around 250 miles per hour), so leaps of greater than distance rank 7 take time equal to the distance rank minus 7. For example, a massive leap of 500 miles (distance rank 17) takes time rank 10 (17 - 7, or two hours) of time in the air! Because of this, leapers may choose to make shorter "hops" of just a couple miles, leaving them airborne for only a minute or so, to better control their direction.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-1+LeapingPowerCost			COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Movement	ASPECT:Action|Free	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Duration|Instant	ASPECT:Cost|1 point per rank

#	EXTRA
Affects Others					KEY:Leaping ~ Affects Others						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can give someone you are touching the ability to leap like you do while the effect lasts. You do not need this extra to simply carry someone while you leap; you can carry what your Strength normally allows. +0 or +1 cost per rank.
#	FLAW
Acrobatics Check Required			KEY:Leaping ~ Acrobatics Check Required				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:In order to use Leaping, you must make an Acrobatics skill check (DC 10). Each point your check total exceeds the DC allows you to use 1 rank of Leaping, up to your total rank. -1 cost per rank.
Full Power						KEY:Leaping ~ Full Power						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:With this flaw, you can only leap your maximum distance; you can make shorter leaps only by not using your Leaping effect at all, just the normal jumping distance for your Strength. This may suit uncontrollable "leaping" effects like rocket boosters and the like. Flat -1 point.

Luck																	CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,3+LuckPowerCost		DESC:You can use hero points or ranks of Luck to affect others in various ways (see Hero Points, page 20). For each rank you have in this effect, choose one of the following capabilities:																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-3+LuckPowerCost			COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Control	ASPECT:Action|Reaction	ASPECT:Range|Perception	ASPECT:Duration|Instant	ASPECT:Cost|3 points per rank

#	EXTRA
Area							KEY:Luck ~ Area								CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets in the affected area. You spend only one hero point, but the subjects are each affected individually. You must apply the same effect to all subjects at once. +1 cost per rank.
Luck							KEY:Luck ~ Luck								CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Each rank in this extra gives you the benefit of a rank in the Luck advantage (see Luck in the Advantages chapter). It is subject to the same limits as the Luck advantage set by the GM. Flat +1 point per rank of Luck.
Selective						KEY:Luck ~ Selective							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:This extra, applied to Area Luck Control, allows you to choose who in the area is or is not affected by it. +1 cost per rank.
#	FLAW
Action						KEY:Luck ~ Action								CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:If the action required for Luck Control is increased beyond a reaction, it is only usable during your turn each round, which limits its usefulness in responding to the actions of others. -1 cost per rank.
Ranged						KEY:Luck ~ Ranged								CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Luck Control normally requires no attack check; if Ranged, it does. -1 cost per rank.
Resistible						KEY:Luck ~ Resistible							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Targets of your Luck Control get a resistance check-usually Dodge or Will-to avoid its effects. -1 cost per rank.
Side Effect						KEY:Luck ~ Side Effect							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:As a particular side effect of Luck Control, if your effort to alter luck fails, you suffer a setback without earning a hero point. Effectively the GM gains a "free" complication against you. -1 or -2 cost per rank.

Mind Reading															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+Mind_ReadingPowerCost	DESC:You can read another character's mind. To use Mind Reading, make an opposed effect check against the result of the target's Will check. The degree of success determines the degree of contact:																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-2+Mind_ReadingPowerCost		COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Sensory	ASPECT:Action|Standard	ASPECT:Range|Perception	ASPECT:Duration|Sustained	ASPECT:Cost|2 points per rank	ASPECT:Resistance Check|Success 1 - Surface thoughts&colon; You can read what the target is presently thinking. Mind Reading transcends language; you comprehend the target's thoughts whether or not you share a common language. &lbracket;Success 2&rbracket; Personal thoughts&colon; You can probe deeper into the target's mind for information. You can essentially ask any one question and receive the answer from the target's mind. If the target doesn't know the answer, then you know that as well. &lbracket;Success 3&rbracket; Memory&colon; You can read the subject's memories and recollections. This allows you to perceive them exactly as the target recalls them, one memory per round. &lbracket;Success 4&rbracket; Subconscious&colon; You can read memories from the target's subconscious, things even the target does not consciously know. This might mean repressed or hidden memories, deep-seated psychological traumas, or even other personalities. If you lose the opposed check, you cannot read the target's mind. With two or more degrees of failure, any renewed attempt in that scene requires extra effort (see Extra Effort). If you desire a greater degree of contact, you must take another standard action and make a new opposed check. The target gets a new Will check (DC 10 + Mind Reading rank) at the end of each turn to shut you out; success ends the effect.

#	EXTRA
Cumulative						KEY:Mind Reading ~ Cumulative						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Your Mind Reading adds any further degrees of success to the existing degree on the target, rather than using just the result of the new opposed check. For example, if you have one degree of contact and make another Mind Reading check, getting one degree, you now have two degrees of contact. +1 cost per rank.
Effortless						KEY:Mind Reading ~ Effortless						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Trying again after two or more degrees of failure does not require extra effort for you. You can retry a Mind Reading attempt an unlimited number of times. +1 cost per rank.
Sensory Link					KEY:Mind Reading ~ Sensory Link					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can "tap into" the senses of your subjects, perceiving what they perceive like a Remote Sensing effect (see Remote Sensing) so long as you have at least one degree of contact. Your own senses are inactive while you are using your sensory link and you can only perceive through the senses of one subject at a time. +1 cost per rank.
Subtle						KEY:Mind Reading ~ Subtle						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:As a mental sensory effect, Mind Reading has a degree of subtlety, only noticeable to the subject or to characters with an appropriate mental sense, such as Mental Awareness (see the Senses effect). Subtle Mind Reading is less detectable, requiring a DC 20 Perception check for either type of character to sense it, while two ranks of the Subtle modifier makes your Mind Reading completely undetectable. Flat +1 or 2 points.
#	FLAW
Close							KEY:Mind Reading ~ Close						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Applied to Ranged Mind Reading, Close Mind Reading requires a close attack check to touch an unwilling target and physical contact throughout the effect's duration; breaking contact ends the effect. -1 cost per rank.
Feedback						KEY:Mind Reading ~ Feedback						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You suffer Feedback if a subject you are reading is harmed, using your Mind Reading rank as the resistance check bonus against the damage. Additionally, you may suffer Feedback at the GM's discretion from reading or experiencing particularly traumatic or emotionally-charged thoughts of memories from the subject. -1 cost per rank.
Limited by Language				KEY:Mind Reading ~ Limited by Language				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can only understand the subject's thoughts or memories if you share a common language. -1 cost per rank.
Limited to Emotions				KEY:Mind Reading ~ Limited to Emotions				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can only read or probe for emotions and emotional associations, not coherent thoughts or memories. -1 cost per rank.
Limited to Sensory Link				KEY:Mind Reading ~ Limited to Sensory Link			CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:If you have the Sensory Link extra and this flaw, you can only tap into a subject's senses, you cannot read their thoughts or memories. -1 cost per rank.
Limited to Surface Thoughts			KEY:Mind Reading ~ Limited to Surface Thoughts			CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can only read surface thoughts and cannot achieve higher degrees of contact. -1 cost per rank.
Ranged						KEY:Mind Reading ~ Ranged						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Ranged Mind Reading requires a ranged attack check in addition to the effect's normal resistance check. -1 cost per rank.
Sense-Dependent					KEY:Mind Reading ~ Sense-Dependent					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Your Mind Reading is dependent on a sense other than just having to accurately sense the target, such as needing to see his expressions (Sight-Dependent), hear him speak (Hearing-Dependent), smell his changes in biochemistry (Scent-Dependent), and so forth. Alternately, it may be dependent on first being in Mental Communication with the target (see Communication). -1 cost per rank.

Morph																	CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,5+MorphPowerCost		DESC:You can alter your appearance. Your traits do not change; your new form is merely a cosmetic change. You gain a +20 bonus to Deception checks to disguise yourself as the form you assume (see the Disguise guidelines for Deception). Your Morph rank determines what form(s) you can assume: At rank 1 you can assume a single other appearance. At rank 2 you can assume any of a narrow group of forms, such as people of roughly your size and gender, a type of animal like birds or reptiles, and so forth. At rank 3 you can assume any of a broad group of forms like humanoids, animals, machines, and so forth. At rank 4 you can assume any form of the same mass as your own. For the ability to change size as well as appearance see the Growth and Shrinking effects. To take on the other traits of forms you assume, see the Metamorph extra, following, or the Variable effect, later in this chapter.																																																																																																																																																																																																																				BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-5+MorphPowerCost			COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|General	ASPECT:Action|Free	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Duration|Sustained	ASPECT:Cost|5 points per rank

#	EXTRA
Attack						KEY:Morph ~ Attack							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:A Morph Attack imposes a different appearance on the target creature. Unlike an Affliction that imposes the transformed condition, a Morph Attack is entirely cosmetic: you can't change the target's traits other than appearance. +0 cost per rank.
Metamorph						KEY:Morph ~ Metamorph							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Morph only changes your appearance; you still have all the traits of your normal form. This modifier allows you to have an alternate set of traits, essentially a complete alternate character you change into, one set of traits per rank in Metamorph. You can switch between sets of traits at will, once per round, as a free action. Your other form(s) must have the same point total as you and are subject to the same power level limits. They must also have traits suitable to your Morph effect. For example, if you can only Morph into humanoid forms, then your alternate forms all have to be humanoid. All of your forms must have your full Morph effect as well; those power points cannot be reallocated. The GM may require certain additional common traits for all of your forms, particularly mental abilities and skills, if you retain them. Metamorph is best suited to characters with defined sets of alternate traits. For a character able to transform into a virtually unlimited number of forms with various traits, see the Variable effect later in this chapter. Flat +1 point per rank of Metamorph.
#	FLAW
Resistible						KEY:Morph ~ Resistible							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:A Morph effect Resistible by Will is most likely a mental illusion of some sort. Observers who succeed on the Will resistance check see you as you truly are rather than in your Morph guise. This is in addition to the usual Perception check to penetrate your disguise. If you have the Metamorph extra, then targets that resist your effect treat you as if you had your normal traits, and not those granted by your Metamorph form. -1 cost per rank.

Move Object																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+Move_ObjectPowerCost	DESC:You can move objects at a distance without touching them. Move Object has no action/reaction; a moving object cannot drag the character "holding on" to it, for example. This effect is also not considered "physical contact" or "touch" for effects requiring it. Your effective Strength for lifting and moving objects with this effect is equal to your rank. By taking a move action to concentrate you can increase this by +1 Str, changing the effect's duration to Concentration (see Duration at the start of this chapter). This is in addition to using extra effort to further increase your rank (see Extra Effort, page 19). This effect can move objects, but cannot perform tasks of fine manipulation (like untying knots, typing, or manipulating controls) without the Precise modifier. Objects thrown into targets as attacks base their damage off your power rank as if it were your Strength rank. Move Object cannot inflict damage directly; you can't "punch" or "crush" objects with it. You can use it to make disarm, grab, and trip attacks. See the Action &amp; Adventure chapter for details.																																																																																																																																																																																				BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-2+Move_ObjectPowerCostPowerCost	COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Control	ASPECT:Action|Standard	ASPECT:Range|Ranged	ASPECT:Duration|Sustained	ASPECT:Cost|2 points per rank
#	EXTRA
Continuous						KEY:Move Object ~ Continuous						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Move Move Object generally cannot have a continuous duration, since it is an active effect and requires at least a modicum of attention to maintain. The GM may allow Continuous Move Object as a variation that is not disrupted when you are unable to maintain it, but that still requires your conscious attention to do anything other than have the affected object hang in midair. There's no change in the cost of the extra, this is just a limitation of the Move Object effect. You must make Move Object's duration Sustained (+1 cost per rank) before you can make it Continuous. +1 cost per rank.
Damaging						KEY:Move Object ~ Damaging						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Your effect can inflict damage, like an application of normal Strength with damage equal to its rank. This includes damaging targets in grabs and making ranged "strike" attacks. +1 cost per rank.
Improvised Weapon or Throwing Mastery	KEY:Move Object ~ Improvised Weapon or Throwing Mastery	CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You are particularly adept at using objects as weapons with your power. Each rank of either advantage increases the damage of objects wielded or thrown using Move Object by 1. Flat +1 point per rank of Improvised Weapon or Throwing Mastery.
Perception						KEY:Move Object ~ Perception						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Perception Ranged Move Object can affect any object you can accurately perceive, with no need for an attack check. +1 cost per rank.
Precise						KEY:Move Object ~ Precise						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Move Object with this modifier can be used for tasks involving fine manipulation. Flat +1 point.
Subtle						KEY:Move Object ~ Subtle						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:The default version of Move Object involves some noticeable manifestation like a "tractor beam," a glow around your head or hands (along with a corresponding glow around the affected object), big glowing hands, blazing "energy talons," a lasso, whip, or the like. Apply the Subtle modifier for a less noticeable Move Object effect, such as invisible "psychokinesis" (which is generally also Perception Range). +1 point per rank.
#	FLAW
Close							KEY:Move Object ~ Close							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Since Move Object works on things at a distance by definition, it cannot generally be reduced to close ranged. At the GM's discretion, a Close Ranged Move Object effect may represent "tactile telekinesis" or a supernatural influence over objects you are able to touch, but such things are usually better represented by the Enhanced Strength effect. -1 cost per rank.
Concentration					KEY:Move Object ~ Concentration					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Concentration Move Object requires more attention to maintain. You cannot concentrate to increase your lifting capacity or to grab or move another object while you are still "holding" your first. -1 cost per rank.
Limited Direction					KEY:Move Object ~ Limited Direction					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can only move objects in a particular direction or path, such as only up and down (towards and away from the ground), only directly towards or away from you (attraction and repulsion), and so forth. This is useful for "gravitic" or "magnetic" versions of the effect. -1 cost per rank.
Limited Material					KEY:Move Object ~ Limited Material					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can only move a particular type of object or material, such as only metals, plants, rock, water, and so forth. -1 cost per rank (The GM may allow a -2 cost per rank flaw for a particularly limited type of material, such as only precious metals, leaves, sand, or petroleum).

Movement																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+MovementPowerCost		DESC:You have a special form of movement. For each rank in this effect, choose one of the following options:																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							BONUS:VAR|Power_Point_Pool|-2+MovementPowerCost			COST:0				ASPECT:Power Type|Movement	ASPECT:Action|Free	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Duration|Sustained	ASPECT:Cost|2 points per rank
# Selections
Dimension Travel															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can move instantly from one dimension to another as a move action. For 1 rank, you can move between your home dimension and one other. For 2 ranks you can move between any of a related group of dimensions (mystical dimensions, alien dimensions, etc). For 3 ranks you can travel to any dimension. You can carry up to 50 lbs. (mass rank 0) of additional material with you when you move. If you apply the Increased Mass modifier, you can carry additional mass up to your modifier rank.
Environmental Adaptation													CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You're adapted to a particular environment, such as underwater, zero gravity, and so forth (see Environmental Hazards, pages 185-187, for details). You suffer none of the normal unfavorable circumstance or movement penalties associated with that environment, moving and acting normally. You are still affected by environmental hazards like suffocation, exposure, and so forth. You need the Immunity effect to ignore such things.
Permeate																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can pass through solid objects as if they weren't there. For 1 rank, you can move at speed rank -2 through any physical object. For 2 ranks, you can move at speed rank -1 and for 3 ranks, you move at your normal speed through any obstacles. You cannot breathe while completely inside a solid object, so you either need Immunity to Suffocation or have to hold your breath. You may also need Penetrates Concealment Senses to know where you're going, since you cannot see inside solid objects, either. Permeate is often Limited to a particular substance like earth, ice, or metal, for example. Permeate provides no protection against attacks, although you do gain cover while inside an object (see Cover, page 192). For the ability to allow things (including attacks) to pass through you, see the Insubstantial effect.
Safe Fall																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:So long as you are capable of action, you can fall any distance without harm. You can also stop your fall at any point along a distance so long as there is a handhold or projection for you to grab (such as a ledge, flagpole, branch, etc.). If you have the Wall-crawling power (later in Movement), any surface you can climb provides you with a handhold. Safe Fall may be Limited to only when you are near a surface (such as the side of a building); you're assumed to be using the surface to help slow your fall.
Slithering																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can move while prone at your normal ground speed. You suffer no circumstance penalty for making attacks while prone.
Space Travel															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can travel faster than the speed of light through the vacuum of space (but not in a planetary atmosphere). At rank 1 you can travel to other planets in a solar system. At rank 2, you can travel to other star systems, while at rank 3, you can visit distant star systems, perhaps even other galaxies! This effect does not provide protection from the rigors of outer space (for that, see the Immunity effect in this chapter).
Sure-Footed																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You're better able to deal with obstacles and obstructions to movement. Reduce the speed penalty for moving through or around such obstacles by 1 for each rank of this effect. If you reduce the speed penalty to 0 or less, you are unaffected by that obstacle and move at full normal speed.
Swinging																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can swing through the air at your normal ground speed rank, using a swing-line you provide or available lines and projections (tree limbs, flagpoles, vines, telephone- and power-lines, etc.).
Time Travel																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can move through time! For 1 rank, you can move between the present and another fixed point in time (such as 100 years into the past, or 1,000 years into the future). For 2 ranks you can move to any point in the past or any point in the future (but not both). For 3 ranks, you can travel to any point in time. Reaching alternate timelines or parallel worlds requires at least 2 ranks of Dimension-Travel. You can carry up to 50 lbs. (mass rank 0) of additional material with you when you time-travel. If you apply the Increased Mass modifier, you can carry additional mass up to your modifier rank.
Trackless																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You leave no trail and cannot be tracked using visual senses (although you can still be tracked using scent or other means). You can walk across the surface of soft sand or snow without leaving tracks and you have total concealment from tremorsense (see Concealment, page 192). Each additional rank renders you trackless to another sense type.
Wall-Crawling															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can climb walls and ceilings at your ground speed rank -1 with no chance of falling and no need for an Athletics check. You are still vulnerable while climbing, however. An additional rank of this effect means you climb at your full speed rank and are not vulnerable while climbing.
Water-Walking															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Selections												DESC:You can stand or move at your normal ground speed on the surface of water, quicksand, and other liquids without sinking. If you fall prone for any reason, you sink into the liquid normally. With 2 ranks of this effect, you can also lie prone on a liquid surface without sinking; you only sink if you choose to.
#
Nullify																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+NullifyPowerCost		DESC:Nullify can counter particular effects of a particular descriptor, such as fire effects, magical effects, mental effects, and so forth (see Countering Effects, at the start of this chapter). You can counter one effect of your chosen descriptor per use of Nullify. You can't nullify innate effects (see the Innate modifier description). Make a ranged attack check to hit the target. Then make an opposed check of your Nullify rank and the targeted effect's rank or the target's Will defense, whichever is higher. If you are targeting the subject of an effect rather than the effect's user, make an opposed check of Nullify rank vs. effect rank. If you win, the targeted effect turns off, although the user can re-activate it normally. If you lose the opposed check, you do not Nullify the effect. With two or more degrees of failure, trying again against the same subject in the same scene requires extra effort.

Affects Insubstantial				KEY:Nullify ~ Affects Insubstantial					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Nullify does not require this modifier to affect insubstantial targets, or the Insubstantial effect itself. You can attempt to nullify the effects of insubstantial targets normally.
Alternate Resistance				KEY:Nullify ~ Alternate Resistance					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Nullify may require a Fortitude rather than a Will check to represent an effect resisted by health and stamina rather than strength of will. +0 cost per rank.
Area							KEY:Nullify ~ Area							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:An Area Nullify effect works on all targets in the area. Make a single power check and compare the result against the opposed checks of the targets. Targets lacking effects you can nullify are, naturally, unaffected. If your Area Nullify has a duration longer than instant, choose whether or not the effect remains in the chosen area (affecting anyone entering or leaving it) or moves with the targets hit with the initial effect. There is no difference in cost, but to be able to do both, take one Area Nullify as an Alternate Effect of the other. +1 cost per rank.
Broad							KEY:Nullify ~ Broad							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Broad Nullify can counter effects of a particularly broad descriptor like magical, mutant, or technological effects. This modifier is available only with the Gamemaster's permission and may depend on the effects available in the series. +1 cost per rank.
Concentration					KEY:Nullify ~ Concentration						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Any countered effect is suppressed and cannot be re-activated while you concentrate. The user of the countered effect may use extra effort to gain another opposed Nullify check. If successful, the effect can be reactivated. +1 cost per rank.
Simultaneous					KEY:Nullify ~ Simultaneous						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Simultaneous Nullify can counter all effects of a particular descriptor (such as fire or magic) at once. +1 cost per rank.
Effortless						KEY:Nullify ~ Effortless						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Trying again after two or more degrees of failure does not require extra effort for you. You can retry a Nullify attempt an unlimited number of times. +1 cost per rank.
Precise						KEY:Nullify ~ Precise							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:If you can Nullify multiple effects, this modifier allows you to choose which are nullified and which are not. Flat +1 point.
Randomize						KEY:Nullify ~ Randomize							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Rather than being countered, the effect(s) targeted by your Nullify acquire the Uncontrolled flaw and go out of control (as dictated by the GM). +0 cost per rank.
Selective						KEY:Nullify ~ Selective							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:If you have an Area Nullify effect, this extra allows you to choose who in the area is affected, nullifying some targets and not others. +1 cost per rank.
Sustained						KEY:Nullify ~ Sustained							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:If this modifier is applied to Concentration Nullify, keeping the countered effect(s) suppressed is only a free action for you each turn. +1 cost per rank.

Side Effect						KEY:Nullify ~ Side Effect						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:If you fail to nullify an effect, you might suffer some kind of "backlash" or similar side effect. -1 cost per rank.

Protection																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+ProtectionPowerCost	DESC:Protection shields you against damage, giving you +1 to your Toughness defense per rank.

Sustained						KEY:Protection ~ Sustained						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Your Protection is a sustained effect, rather than permanent. The effect can be turned on and off and can be improved using extra effort, including using it to perform stunts (see Extra Effort). Sustained Protection might be a power like a personal force field, or the ability to consciously harden your skin and turn it into armor. +0 cost per rank.

Quickness																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+QuicknessPowerCost	DESC:You can perform routine tasks-anything that can be done as a routine check (see Routine Checks in The Basics chapter)-fast, perhaps very fast. Subtract your effect rank from the normal time rank to perform a task to determine how long it takes you. So, for example, if you have Quickness 7, a routine task normally taking an hour (time rank 9) takes you (9 - 7 = time rank 2) 30 seconds. Non-routine checks are not affected by Quickness, nor is movement speed. If you can perform a task in less than a second (time rank -2), the GM may choose to treat that task as a free action for you (although the GM can still limit the number of free actions you can accomplish in a turn as usual).

Regeneration															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+RegenerationPowerCost	DESC:You recover quickly from damage. Remove penalties to your Toughness checks due to damage equal to your Regeneration rank each minute. You then recover other damage conditions equal to your Regeneration rank each minute, starting from your most severe condition. Spread this recovery out evenly over a minute (10 action rounds). So with Regeneration 5, you remove a -1 Toughness penalty every other round (every round with Regeneration 10, and up to a -2 penalty per round with Regeneration 20).	DESC:&nl; [REGENERATION ABSENT STAMINA] Characters with no Stamina do not heal (see Absent Abilities in the Abilities chapter). One or more ranks of Regeneration overcome this. An absent Stamina character with Regeneration 1 recovers at a normal rate; additional Regeneration ranks speed up that rate.

Remote Sensing															CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,4+Remote_SensingPowerCost	DESC:You can displace one or more of your senses over a distance, perceiving as if you were at that location, up to 60 feet away. Each additional rank increases your range one distance rank, so rank 2 is 120 feet, rank 3 is 250 feet, and so on. Remote Sensing overrides your normal sense(s) while you are using it. Subjects observed via Remote Sensing can "feel" it with an Insight check (DC 10 + rank). You can make Perception checks normally using your displaced senses, taking the normal action to do so. To search a large area for someone or something, use the search guidelines given in the description of the Investigation skill. Remote Sensing costs 1 point per rank for one sense type, 2 points per rank for two sense types, 3 points per rank for three, and 4 points per rank for four, and 5 points per rank for all of your senses. Visual senses count as two sense types (so visual Remote Sensing is 2 points per rank). You can use perception range sensory effects via Remote Sensing if your effect applies to their sense type and an accurate sense (usually sight). Sensory effects targeted on the spot where you have displaced your senses affect you normally. Because Remote Sensing overrides your normal senses, you are vulnerable (at half your normal active defenses) while using it, since you are less aware of your immediate surroundings.

#	EXTRA
Dimensional						KEY:Remote Sensing ~ Dimensional					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:This modifier allows you to extend your Remote Sensing into other dimensions with range proximate to your location in that dimension. One rank of Dimensional allows you to sense into a single other dimension, two for a group of related dimensions, and three for any dimension in the setting suitable to your Remote Sensing descriptors. Dimensional Remote Sensing for an accurate sense is especially useful for targeting other Dimension effects. Flat +1 point per rank of Dimensional.
No Conduit						KEY:Remote Sensing ~ No Conduit					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Sensory effects targeted where you have displaced your senses do not affect you, but neither can you use perception ranged effects via your Remote Sensing. Despite the built-in limitation, this is an extra, since it allows you to use your Remote Sensing to observe subjects in relative safety. +1 cost per rank.
Simultaneous					KEY:Remote Sensing ~ Simultaneous					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can use both Remote Sensing and your normal senses at the same time, perceiving two locales like "translucent" overlays of each other. This means you're more capable of taking physical action while also using your Remote Sensing, although the effect still requires its normal duration to maintain. You are not vulnerable while using your Remote Sensing. +1 cost per rank.
Subtle						KEY:Remote Sensing ~ Subtle						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Remote Sensing already has a degree of subtlety. Applying 1 rank of Subtle to Remote Sensing increases the DC to notice the effect to 20 + rank or makes it noticeable only to a particular unusual sense (with the usual DC 10 + rank perception check). Subtle 2 makes Remote Sensing completely unnoticeable, as usual. Flat +1 point per rank of Subtle.
#	FLAW
Feedback						KEY:Remote Sensing ~ Feedback						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:With this flaw, damaging attacks directed at where you displaced your senses can affect you. Your sensory- point is considered to have partial cover from attacks and you use your Remote Sensing rank as your Toughness defense against any successful attack. The feedback may be psychosomatic in nature or due to some sort of disruption caused by an assault on the point where you have redirected your senses. Note that sensory effects already work on you via Remote Sensing and this flaw doesn't apply to them. -1 cost per rank.
Medium						KEY:Remote Sensing ~ Medium						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You require a medium for your Remote Sensing, such as shadows, flames, mirrors, open water, television screens, and so forth. You can only perceive locations where your chosen medium exists. -1 cost per rank.
Noticeable						KEY:Remote Sensing ~ Noticeable					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Remote Sensing with this flaw has an easily noticeable display, like a glowing set of eyes or a phantom image of your face, head, or body at the location you are observing. This manifestation cannot be used for communication, however (for that, take the Communication effect). Flat -1 point.
Sense-Dependent					KEY:Remote Sensing ~ Sense-Dependent				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:Remote Sensing is already Sense- Dependent and cannot apply this flaw. Another effect might potentially have the flaw Remote-Sensing Dependent, such as an Affliction that targets only remote viewers observing a target or an area as a means of blocking or deterring them.

Senses																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+SensesPowerCost		DESC:One or more of your senses are improved, or you have additional sensory abilities beyond the normal five senses. Allocate ranks in Senses to the following effects. Some options require more than one rank, noted in their descriptions. So if you have Senses 5, for example, you can have darkvision (2 ranks), direction sense (1 rank), distance sense (1 rank), and ultra-hearing (1 rank), or any other combination adding up to 5 ranks. Like all sensory effects, Senses uses the sense types described on page 126 as descriptors.

#Selections:
Accurate 2 Or 4 Ranks				KEY:Senses ~ Accurate 2 Or 4 Ranks					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:An accurate sense can pinpoint something's exact location. You can use an accurate sense to target something in combat. Visual and tactile senses are normally accurate for humans. Cost is 2 ranks for one sense, 4 for an entire sense type.
Acute 1-2 Ranks					KEY:Senses ~ Acute 1-2 Ranks						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can sense fine details about anything you can detect with a particular sense, allowing you to distinguish between and identify different subjects. Visual and auditory senses are normally acute for humans. Cost is 1 rank for one sense, 2 for an entire sense type.
Analytical 1-2 Ranks				KEY:Senses ~ Analytical 1-2 Ranks					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:Beyond even acute, you can perceive specific details about anything you can detect with an analytical sense, such as chemical composition, exact dimensions or mass, frequency of sounds and energy wavelengths, and so forth. You can only apply this effect to an acute sense. Normal senses are not analytical. Cost is 1 rank for one sense, 2 for an entire sense type.
Awareness 1 Rank					KEY:Senses ~ Awareness 1 Rank						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can sense the use of effects of a particular descriptor with a successful Perception check (DC 10, with -1 to your check per 10 feet range). Examples include Cosmic Awareness, Divine Awareness, Magical Awareness, Mental Awareness, and so forth. You can apply other Sense effects to your Awareness to modify it. Choose the sense type for your Awareness; it is often a mental sense, but doesn't have to be. Awareness counts as an "exotic sense" for noticing effects with the first rank of the Subtle modifier (see Subtle under Extras for details).
Communication Link 1 Rank			KEY:Senses ~ Communication Link 1 Rank				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You have a link with a particular individual, chosen when you acquire this option, who must also have this ability. The two of you can communicate over any distance like a use of the Communication effect. Choose a sense type as a communication medium when you select this option; mental is common for psychic or empathic links. If you apply the Dimensional modifier to your Communication Link, it extends to other dimensions as well (see Dimensional under Power Modifiers for details).
Counters Concealment 2 Ranks			KEY:Senses ~ Counters Concealment 2 Ranks				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:A sense type with this trait ignores the Concealment effect of a particular descriptor; you sense the subject of the effect normally, as if the Concealment wasn't even there. So if you have vision that Counters Invisibility, for example, then invisible beings are visible to you. For 5 ranks, the sense type ignores all Concealment effects, regardless of descriptor. Concealed subjects seem slightly "off" to you, enough to know they are concealed to others. This trait does not affect concealment provided by opaque objects, for that, see Penetrates Concealment.
Counters Illusion 2 Ranks			KEY:Senses ~ Counters Illusion 2 Ranks				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:A sense type with this trait ignores the Illusion effect; you automatically succeed on your resistance check against the illusion if it affects your sense type, realizing that it isn't real.
Danger Sense 1 Rank				KEY:Senses ~ Danger Sense 1 Rank					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:When you would normally be surprised in combat, make a Perception check (DC 10): One degree of success means you're not surprised, but can't act during the surprise round (so you don't suffer any conditions of being surprised), while two or more degrees of success means you are not surprised and may act during the surprise round (if any). Failure means you are surprised (although, if you have Uncanny Dodge, you are not vulnerable). The GM may raise the DC of the Danger Sense check in some circumstances. Choose a sense type for your Danger Sense. Sensory effects targeting that sense also affect your Danger Sense ability and may "blind" it.
Darkvision 2 Ranks				KEY:Senses ~ Darkvision 2 Ranks					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can see in complete darkness as if it were normal daylight; darkness provides no concealment to your vision. This is essentially the same as Counters Concealment (Darkness).
Detect 1-2 Ranks					KEY:Senses ~ Detect 1-2 Ranks						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can sense a particular item or effect by touch with a Perception check. Detect has no range and only indicates the presence or absence of something (being neither acute nor accurate). Choose what sense type your Detect falls under (often mental). For 2 ranks you can detect things at range (with the normal -1 per 10 feet modifier to your Perception check).
Direction Sense 1 Rank				KEY:Senses ~ Direction Sense 1 Rank					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You always know what direction north lies in and can retrace your steps through any place you've been.
Distance Sense 1 Rank				KEY:Senses ~ Distance Sense 1 Rank					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can accurately and automatically judge distances.
Extended 1 Rank					KEY:Senses ~ Extended 1 Rank						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You have a sense that operates at greater than normal range. Your range with the sense-the distance used to determine penalties to your Perception check-is increased by a factor of 10. Each additional time you apply this option, your range increases by an additional factor of 10, so 1 rank means you have a -1 to Perception checks per 100 feet, 2 ranks makes it -1 per 1,000 feet, and so on. An extended sense may be limited by conditions like the horizon and physical barriers between you and the subject, unless it also Penetrates Concealment.
Infravision 1 Rank				KEY:Senses ~ Infravision 1 Rank					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can see in the infrared portion of the spectrum, allowing you to see heat patterns. Darkness does not provide concealment for objects differing in temperature from their surroundings. If you have the Track effect, you can track warm creatures by the faint heat trails they leave behind. The Gamemaster is the final judge on how long the trail remains visible.
Low-Light Vision 1 Rank				KEY:Senses ~ Low-Light Vision 1 Rank				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You ignore circumstance penalties to visual Perception checks for poor lighting, so long as it is not completely dark.
Microscopic Vision 1-4 Ranks			KEY:Senses ~ Microscopic Vision 1-4 Ranks				CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can view extremely small things. You can make Perception checks to see tiny things nearby. Cost is 1 rank for dust-sized objects, 2 ranks for cellular-sized, 3 ranks for DNA and complex molecules, 4 ranks for atomic-sized. The GM may require an Expertise skill check to understand and interpret what you see.
Penetrates Concealment 4 Ranks		KEY:Senses ~ Penetrates Concealment 4 Ranks			CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:A sense with this trait is unaffected by concealment from obstacles (rather than Concealment effects). So vision that Penetrates Concealment sees right through opaque objects, for example, and hearing that Penetrates Concealment is unaffected by sound-proofing or intervening materials, and so forth.
Postcognition 4 Ranks				KEY:Senses ~ Postcognition 4 Ranks					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:Your senses extend into the past, allowing you to perceive events that took place previously. You can make Perception checks to pick up on past information in an area or from a subject. The Gamemaster sets the DC for these checks based on how obscure and distant in the past the information is, from DC 15 (for a vague vision that may or may not be accurate) to DC 30 (for near complete knowledge of a particular past event as if you were actually present). Your normal (present-day) senses don't work while you're using Postcognition; your awareness is focused on the past. Your postcognitive visions last for as long as you concentrate. Postcognition does not apply to sensory effects like Mind Reading or any other ability requiring interaction. Postcognition may be Limited to past events connected to your own "past lives" or ancestors, reducing cost to 2 ranks.
Precognition 4 Ranks				KEY:Senses ~ Precognition 4 Ranks					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:Your senses extend into the future, allowing you to perceive events that may happen. Your precognitive visions represent possible futures. If circumstances change, then the vision may not come to pass. When you use this ability, the Gamemaster chooses what information to impart. Your visions may be obscure and cryptic, open to interpretation. The Gamemaster may require appropriate Perception skill checks for you to pick up on particularly detailed information, with a DC ranging from 15 to 30 or more. The GM can also activate your Precognition to impart specific information to you as an adventure hook or plot device. Your normal (present-day) senses don't work while you're using Precognition; your awareness is focused on the future. Your precognitive visions last as long as you concentrate. Precognition does not apply to sensory effects like Mind Reading or any other ability requiring interaction.
Radio 1 Rank					KEY:Senses ~ Radio 1 Rank						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can "hear" radio frequencies including AM, FM, television, cellular, police bands, and so forth. This allows you to pick up on Radio Communication (see the Communication effect). This is the base sense of the radio sense type. It's ranged, radius, and acute by default.
Radius 1-2 Ranks					KEY:Senses ~ Radius 1-2 Ranks						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can make Perception checks with a radius sense for any point around you. Subjects behind you cannot use Stealth to hide from you without some other concealment. Auditory, olfactory, and tactile senses are normally radius for humans. Cost is 1 rank for use with one sense, 2 ranks for one sense type.
Ranged 1 Rank					KEY:Senses ~ Ranged 1 Rank						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can use a sense that normally has no range (taste or touch in humans) to make Perception checks at range, with the normal -1 per 10 feet modifier. This can be enhanced with the Extended Sense effect.
Rapid 1 Rank					KEY:Senses ~ Rapid 1 Rank						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can read or take in information from a sense faster than normal: each rank increases your perception speed by a factor of 10 (x10, x100, etc.) with a single sense, double cost for an entire sense type. You can use rapid vision to speedread, pick up on rapid flickering between frames of a film, watch video replays in fast-forward speeds, and such, rapid hearing to listen to time-compressed audio "blips," and so forth.
Time Sense 1 Rank					KEY:Senses ~ Time Sense 1 Rank					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You always know what time it is and can time events as if you had an accurate stopwatch.
Tracking 1 Rank					KEY:Senses ~ Tracking 1 Rank						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can follow trails and track using a particular sense. Basic DC to follow a trail is 10, modified by circumstances, as the GM sees fit. You move at your speed rank -1 while tracking. For 2 ranks, you can move at full normal speed while tracking
Ultra-Hearing 1 Rank				KEY:Senses ~ Ultra-Hearing 1 Rank					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can hear very high and low frequency sounds, like dog whistles or ultrasonic signals, including those used by some remote controls.
Ultravision 1 Rank				KEY:Senses ~ Ultravision 1 Rank					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:SenseSelection.Power											DESC:You can see ultraviolet light, allowing you to see normally at night by the light of the stars or other UV light sources.

Senses ~ Affects Others					KEY:Senses ~ Affects Others						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra.SpecialQuality										DESC:You can grant the benefits of one or more Senses to another character. Apply Affects Others only to the ranks of the chosen sense(s). +0 or +1 cost per rank.
Senses ~ Area							KEY:Senses ~ Area								CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra.SpecialQuality										DESC:The Area modifier only applies to Senses that Affect Others, and only to extend their benefits to everyone in an area. Apply the Selective modifier for the ability to choose who in the area does and does not benefit from the Senses. To affect the area of a sense itself, use the Extended and Radius traits of the Senses effect. +1 cost per rank.
Senses ~ Dimensional						KEY:Senses ~ Dimensional						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra.SpecialQuality										DESC:This modifier allows you to extend your senses into other dimensions. It's assumed to apply to all your senses, allowing you to sense your proximate location in the other dimension(s). For a more extended range, use Remote Sensing with this modifier. +1 point per rank.
Senses ~ Innate						KEY:Senses ~ Innate							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra.SpecialQuality										DESC:Senses, particularly those of aliens or constructs like robots, may be Innate, although this does not prevent sensory effects like Concealment or Dazzle from disabling them. Flat +1 point.
Senses ~ Ranged						KEY:Senses ~ Ranged							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Extra.SpecialQuality										DESC:Likewise, the Ranged extra only applies to Senses that Affect Others, extending the distance at which you can grant their benefits. To extend the range of a sense itself, use the Extended, Radius, and Ranged options of the Senses effect. +1 or +2 cost per rank.
#	FLAW
Senses ~ Limited						KEY:Senses ~ Limited							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw.SpecialQuality										DESC:Some Senses may be Limited to only sensing certain things or only under certain circumstances. As usual, the sense must lose about half its utility to qualify for this flaw, less than that is more likely a particular descriptor associated with the sense and may constitute a complication at the GM's discretion when it comes up in play. -1 cost per rank.
Senses ~ Noticeable						KEY:Senses ~ Noticeable							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw.SpecialQuality										DESC:Senses with this flaw are particularly noticeable in some way: your eyes may glow, for example, or you may emit a noticeable sound, vibration, energy, or the like for use as a sensor. Flat -1 point.
Senses ~ Unreliable						KEY:Senses ~ Unreliable							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.Flaw.SpecialQuality										DESC:Some Senses may be unreliable; the GM makes checks for reliability when the sense is used. Two variations of this flaw may apply: in the first, the Senses effect is unreliable, when it doesn't work, the character perceives nothing with that sense. In the second, the character's perceptions are unreliable, the sense appears to work, but the character gets the wrong information. For this reason, the GM should make all reliability checks for Senses in secret, just informing the player of what the character does (or does not) notice. -1 cost per rank.

Shrinking																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+ShrinkingPowerCost	DESC:You can temporarily decrease your size, becoming smaller, harder to see - and hit - at the cost of losing Strength and speed. Every 4 ranks of Shrinking reduces your size rank by 1 (normal humans are size rank -2 by default) and each reduction in size rank subtracts 1 from your Strength and every two reductions in size rank subtract 1 from your ground speed rank. Add half your Shrinking rank (rounded down) to your active defenses. Add your Shrinking rank as a bonus to Stealth checks, since you are harder to spot, but apply half your rank (rounded down) as a penalty to Intimidation checks (hard to be imposing when you're tiny). Shrinking modifiers are restricted by power level limits. So at Shrinking 12, you are size rank -5 (about 6 inches tall), and have a +6 bonus to active defenses and +12 Stealth bonus, but -3 Strength, -1 speed, and -6 Intimidation penalties.

Shrinking ~ Atomic						KEY:Shrinking ~ Atomic							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:At Shrinking 20 (and size rank -7), you can shrink down to the molecular or even atomic level, allowing you to pass through solid objects by slipping between their atoms. It takes at least a full turn to do so, possibly longer for larger objects. You're effectively immune to damage and many effects at this scale, since you are essentially shifted out of the ordinary universe. The GM decides if a particular effect can reach you at the atomic level. If you have this extra, you might also acquire a Dimensional Travel effect allowing you to shift into a sub-atomic "universe" or similar realm. Flat +1 point.
Shrinking ~ Normal Strength					KEY:Shrinking ~ Normal Strength					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You retain your full Strength, Speed, and Intimidation while shrunk. +1 cost per rank.

Summon																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+SummonPowerCost		DESC:You can call upon another creature-a minion-to aid you. This creature is created as an independent character with (effect rank x 15) power points. A summoned minion is limited to a Power Level equal to the rank of the Summon effect used to create it, is subject to the normal power level limits, and cannot have minions of its own, either from this effect or the Minions advantage. You can summon your minion automatically as a standard action; it appears in the nearest open space beside you. Minions have their own initiative (see Initiative in the Action &amp; Adventure chapter) and act starting on the round after you summon them. Summoned minions are dazed, taking only a standard action each round. Directing a minion to do something is a move action for you, but minions generally do as they are told until a task is completed. You always have the same minion unless you apply the Variable Type modifier, allowing you to summon different minions. Your minion automatically has a helpful attitude and does its best to aid you and obey your commands. Incapacitated minions disappear. They recover normally and you cannot summon an incapacitated minion until it has completely recovered. Your summoned minions also vanish if your effect is not maintained, or is countered or nullified. For more information and rules regarding Minions, see page 193.

Summon ~ Active						KEY:Summon ~ Active							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:Your minions are particularly independent and do not have the dazed condition, having a full set of actions each round. +1 cost per rank.
Summon ~ Controlled						KEY:Summon ~ Controlled							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:Your minions all have the controlled condition (see Controlled in The Basics chapter). They have no free will of their own and are completely under your direction. +1 cost per rank.
Summon ~ Heroic						KEY:Summon ~ Heroic							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:The creatures you summon are not subject to the minion rules, but treated like normal non-player characters. Additionally, they do not have the dazed condition and take a full set of actions each round. Do not apply the Active modifier to Heroic minions, as this modifier already includes it. Gamemasters should be particularly cautious about allowing this extra for Summon effects used by player characters, especially ones summoning more than one minion. +2 cost per rank.
Summon ~ Horde							KEY:Summon ~ Horde							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:If you have Multiple Minions (see following) you may take a standard action to summon any number of minions up to your maximum amount. You are vulnerable (see the Distracting flaw) until the start of your next turn when summoning a horde. +1 cost per rank.
Summon ~ Mental Link						KEY:Summon ~ Mental Link						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You have a mental link with your minions, allowing you to communicate with them and issue orders telepathically like the Communication Link effect (see the Senses effects in this chapter). Flat +1 point.
Summon ~ Multiple Minions					KEY:Summon ~ Multiple Minions						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can summon more than one minion. Each application of this extra doubles your total number of minions. So, for example, with Summon 6, you summon a single 90-point minion. With Multiple Minions 1, you can summon two 90-point minions, with Multiple Minions 2, four minions, and so forth. It requires a standard action to summon each minion unless you also have the Horde extra (see previous). +2 cost per rank.
Summon ~ Sacrifice						KEY:Summon ~ Sacrifice							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:When you are hit with an effect requiring a resistance check, you can spend a hero point to shift it to one of your minions instead. The minion must be within range of the effect and a viable target. Needless to say, this is not a particularly heroic ability. In fact, the GM may wish to restrict it to villains or non-player characters (in which case a hero earns a hero point when a villain uses this extra to avoid an effect by sacrificing a minion). Flat +1 point.
Summon ~ Variable Type					KEY:Summon ~ Variable Type						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:Minions are normally identical in terms of traits, although they may differ cosmetically. With this modifier you can summon different minions of a general type (like elementals, birds, fish, etc.), or even a broad type (like animals, demons, humanoids, etc.). General Type: +1 cost per rank. Broad Type: +2 cost per rank.

Summon ~ Attitude						KEY:Summon ~ Attitude							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Flaw										DESC:Your summoned minions are less than cooperative: indifferent or even unfriendly. You can use interaction skills and other effects to get your summoned minions to cooperate, but success is by no means assured! Indifferent: -1 cost per rank. Unfriendly: -2 cost per rank.
Summon ~ Resistible						KEY:Summon ~ Resistible							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Flaw										DESC:Your minions get an appropriate resistance check (typically Will) against (DC 10 + Summon rank) to avoid being summoned. If they successfully resist, you cannot attempt to summon them again in that scene without using extra effort. -1 cost per rank.

Swimming																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,1+SwimmingPowerCost		DESC:You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your Swimming rank -2, subject to the usual rules for swimming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that see Immunity, page 113).

Teleport																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,2+TeleportPowerCost		DESC:You can move instantly from place to place without crossing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and up to 50 lbs. (mass rank 0) of additional mass a distance rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling passengers get a Dodge resistance check to avoid being taken along. You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense or know especially well (in the GM's judgment). You retain your position and relative velocity when you teleport. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still falling at the same speed when you arrive at your destination. Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space Travel effect of Movement as a "hyperjump" or similar power.

Teleport ~ Accurate						KEY:Teleport ~ Accurate							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You don't need to know or accurately sense your destination to teleport there, just be able to generally describe it, such as "inside the capitol building lobby" or "atop the Emerald Tower's roof." If the destination isn't in your Teleport range, nothing happens. +1 cost per rank.
Teleport ~ Change Direction					KEY:Teleport ~ Change Direction					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can change your direction or orientation after a teleport. Flat +1 point.
Teleport ~ Change Velocity					KEY:Teleport ~ Change Velocity					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can teleport "at rest" to your destination. Among other things, this means you can teleport out of a fall and suffer no damage. Flat +1 point.
Teleport ~ Easy							KEY:Teleport ~ Easy							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You are not dazed or vulnerable when making extended teleports (following). +1 cost per rank.
Teleport ~ Extended						KEY:Teleport ~ Extended							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can take two move actions to make an extended teleport with a distance rank equal to your effect rank +8. You are dazed and vulnerable for one round after an extended teleport. +1 cost per rank.

The portal is five feet across. Anyone stepping through the portal (a move action) is transported. The portal remains open as long as you concentrate, taking a standard action each turn to maintain it. +2 cost per rank.
Teleport ~ Turnabout						KEY:Teleport ~ Turnabout						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can teleport, take a standard action, and teleport back to your starting point in a single round, so long as the total distance moved doesn't exceed your Teleport range. Flat +1 point.

Teleport ~ Limited to Extended				KEY:Teleport ~ Limited to Extended					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Flaw										DESC:You can only make extended teleports. You must have the Extended extra, and this flaw effectively makes it a +0 modifier. -1 cost per rank.
Teleport ~ Medium						KEY:Teleport ~ Medium							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Flaw										DESC:You require a medium for your teleportation, such as electrical or telephone wires, root structures, waterways, shadows, flames, mirrors, and so forth.

# COMMENT: Implement several versions or "additionals to select"
Transform																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,4+TransformPowerCost	DESC:You can change objects into other objects, altering their shape or material composition in the process. You must touch the chosen object, which requires a close attack check if the object is held or worn by another character. What you can transform affects cost per rank: � 2 points: Transform one thing or substance into one other thing or substance, such as metal into wood, iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones. � 3 points: Transform a broad group of things into a single result (any metal into gold, for example) or a single target into any of a broad group (one type of metal, such as lead, into any other metal, water into other liquids, and so forth). � 4 points: Transform a broad group of targets into one of a broad group of results (solids into other solids, for example). � 5 points: Transform any material into anything else. Inanimate objects do not make resistance checks and transform automatically, so long as you can affect their total mass. You can transform (Transform rank -6) rank mass, so Transform 1 can affect up to 1.5 lbs (mass rank -5), then 3 lbs. at rank 2, and so forth, on up to rank 20, which affects 400 tons at once. The transformation lasts as a sustained effect. When you stop maintaining it, the target reverts to normal. Continuous Transform is irreversible except by using another Transform effect to turn the target back into its previous form. Transforming someone's devices or equipment requires targeting them first: characters can make Dodge resistance checks for their held or worn items, with a +5 circumstance bonus for hand-held and similar sized objects. So transforming a hand-held weapon like a gun requires an attack check and permits the wielder a Dodge resistance check with a +5 bonus (for a hand-held item). Targeting a worn suit of armor requires an attack check and allows the wearer a Dodge resistance check (with no modifier for a large item). Transform is generally just another way of "removing" a device or equipment, considered a part of their discount in cost, although transformed items should eventually be restored or replaced.

#	FLAW
Variable																CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power					PREVARGTEQ:Power_Point_Pool,7+VariablePowerCost		DESC:You can gain or use potentially any effect of the appropriate type and descriptor! A Variable effect provides you with a set of (rank x 5) power points you can allocate to different effects. Take an action on your turn and choose where to allocate your Variable power points. It is a good idea to have a "menu" of commonly used options written down in advance to help speed up this process during play. The effects you gain from your Variable effect are subject to the normal power level and series limits. So you cannot, for example, acquire Enhanced Trait as a Variable effect to improve a trait beyond its power level limit, or acquire effects or descriptors the Gamemaster has specifically banned from the series. The GM has final say as to whether or not a particular use of a Variable effect is appropriate and may veto your allocations, if necessary. You must also place descriptors on your Variable effect limiting its scope. For example, a Variable effect that mimics other's traits is limited to the traits its subject(s) possess; a Variable effect providing you with traits suitable to different shapes is limited by the form(s) you assume; a Variable effect providing adaptations is limited to the stimulus to which it adapts, and so forth. This descriptor does not reduce the effect's cost unless it's especially narrow or limiting, and the GM is the final arbiter of what constitutes a suitable descriptor and which descriptors are narrow enough to qualify for a Limited flaw. The allocation of your Variable points is sustained, so if you stop maintaining your Variable effect for any reason, your allocated points "reset" to a "null" state: you lose any temporary traits and must take the action necessary to reallocate your Variable points again on your turn to regain them. Points in a Continuous Variable effect remain where you set them without maintenance, unless the Variable effect itself is countered or nullified. Variable effects cannot be permanent in duration by definition.

Action (Move Action)				KEY:Variable ~ Action (Move Action)					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can change the configuration of your effect faster, although only a Reaction Variable can change more often than once per turn, and then only in response to its triggering circumstances. Gamemasters should exercise caution with Variable effects that can be reconfigured as a free action or reaction: they not only grant tremendous flexibility, they can also slow down game play as the player considers virtually infinite possibilities for each action using the Variable effect. Move Action: +1 cost per rank.
Action (Free Action)				KEY:Variable ~ Action (Free Action)					CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can change the configuration of your effect faster, although only a Reaction Variable can change more often than once per turn, and then only in response to its triggering circumstances. Gamemasters should exercise caution with Variable effects that can be reconfigured as a free action or reaction: they not only grant tremendous flexibility, they can also slow down game play as the player considers virtually infinite possibilities for each action using the Variable effect. Free Action: +2 cost per rank.

Gamemasters should exercise caution with Variable effects that can be reconfigured as a free action or reaction: they not only grant tremendous flexibility, they can also slow down game play as the player considers virtually infinite possibilities for each action using the Variable effect. Reaction: +3 cost per rank.
Affects Others					KEY:Variable ~ Affects Others						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can grant effects to someone else. The subject granted the use of the effect controls its configuration, if appropriate for its descriptors (although you retain the ability to withdraw use of the effect altogether whenever you wish).

Perception						KEY:Variable ~ Perception						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:Applied to a Ranged Affects Others Variable, this extra allows you to grant the benefits of the effect to any target you can accurately perceive. +1 cost per rank.
Ranged						KEY:Variable ~ Ranged							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:A Variable effect with Affects Others may have the Ranged extra to improve the range at which you can grant the effect to another. This does not alter the ranges of the effect's various configurations. To do so, apply the Range modifier to the effect(s) within a particular configuration. +1 cost per rank.
#	FLAW
Limited						KEY:Variable ~ Limited							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:As noted in the description, a Variable effect must be limited by certain descriptors by default. To qualify for this flaw, the effect must be even more limited. This is highly situational and left to the Gamemaster's judgment. An example is a Variable effect only able to provide Enhanced Skills; in most settings, this is Limited. However, in settings where powers are rare and most characters rely on skills, it might not be. Conversely, a Variable effect prohibited from providing Enhanced Skills, but able to provide a wide range of other effects, isn't particularly Limited, just defined by its descriptors. -1 (or more) cost per rank.
Slow							KEY:Variable ~ Slow							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality											DESC:You can only reconfigure your Variable effect outside of action time. You might need access to a lab, arsenal, spellbook, or other special equipment, or need to perform certain procedures or rituals. It takes at least a minute, possibly as long as an hour or more. The GM sets the specific time in cases where it matters, but it should be short enough that you can reconfigure between scenes in a game, but long enough that you effectively cannot do it during action time. The GM may allow you to spend a hero point to reconfigure your Variable effect during action time as a power stunt, if circumstances warrant it. -1 cost per rank.

Affects Objects					KEY:Weaken ~ Affects Objects						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:Weaken with this modifier works on inanimate objects, although the effect can still only affect traits the objects possess. This is most often applied to Weaken Toughness for an effect that can weaken both creatures and objects. +1 cost per rank, +0 for Affects Only Objects.
Broad							KEY:Weaken ~ Broad							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:You can Weaken any of a broad set of traits, one at a time suited to your effects descriptors. So you might be able to Weaken Abilities, for example, or Weaken Mental Effects. You choose which trait from the set is weakened when you use the effect. +1 cost per rank.
Concentration					KEY:Weaken ~ Concentration						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:Once you have hit with a Concentration Weaken, so long as you continue to take a standard action each turn to maintain the effect, the target must make a new resistance check against it, with no attack check required. +1 cost per rank.
Incurable						KEY:Weaken ~ Incurable							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:Weaken with this modifier cannot have its effects countered by another power (such as Restorative Healing) without the Persistent modifier; the target must recover from the Weaken normally. Flat +1 point.
Precise						KEY:Weaken ~ Precise							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:A Weaken effect capable of reducing more than one trait at once can have this modifier, allowing you to choose which traits are affected, while not affecting others. Note this differs from the Selective extra (following). Flat +1 point.
Progressive						KEY:Weaken ~ Progressive						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:A Progressive Weaken effect reduces the affected traits each round until the target successfully resists. Make a new resistance check for the target at the end of each turn; failure weakens the affected trait(s) further, while success stops the Progressive Weaken, but the target must still recover ranks already lost (at the rate of 1 point per turn). +2 cost per rank.
Selective						KEY:Weaken ~ Selective							CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:This extra is applied to an Area Weaken so it only affects some targets and not others. Combined with Precise (previously), you can use an Area Weaken to selectively affect only certain traits of certain targets. +1 cost per rank.
Simultaneous					KEY:Weaken ~ Simultaneous						CATEGORY:Power		TYPE:Power.SpecialQuality.Extra										DESC:If applied to a Broad Weaken, this extra allows it to affect all of the traits in its set at the same time. Each trait loses the difference between the resistance check result and the DC in power points on a failed check. So a Simultaneous Weaken Fire Effects subtracts points from every fire effect the target possesses with a single attack. The effect must be Broad to apply this modifier. +1 cost per rank.
