Skill Memory				KEY:Akashic ~ Skill Memory							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:Akashics can reach into the collective memory and gain insight into a needed skill-even one in which the character has no ranks and cannot use untrained (but not a language). After a full round of concentration, the akashic gains a +2 bonus to a single skill check attempt made the next round. The akashic can use skill memory once per day per two akashic levels (once per day at 1st through 3rd level, twice per day at 4th and 5th levels, three times per day at 6th and 7th levels, and so on). At 9th level, this bonus becomes +4. At 17th level, it is +6. At 25th level it is +8.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Perfect Recall				KEY:Akashic ~ Perfect Recall							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:By 2nd level, akashics have honed their own memories. To any Knowledge skill check that they make without using skill memory (thus relying on their own memory), they add their Intelligence bonus, if any, to the skill bonus again. Thus, an akashic with 5 ranks of Knowledge (history) and a +2 Intelligence bonus has a skill bonus of +9 (5 + 2 + 2) using perfect recall. Akashics without an Intelligence bonus gain nothing from this ability. The akashic also can add double his Intelligence bonus if the DM calls for an Intelligence check to remember something. Intelligent akashics can use this ability to memorize vast amounts of information, which they can recall at a moment's notice.									SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Delve Into Collective Memory		KEY:Akashic ~ Delve Into Collective Memory				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic may make a special check with a bonus equal to his level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. This takes 10 minutes and can be attempted once per day per class level. (For some reason, akashics have trouble obtaining information about runechildren. No one knows why.) This check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. The akashic may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. The DM determines the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table below.												SOURCEPAGE:p.40
Minor Akashic Ability			KEY:Akashic ~ Minor Akashic Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th level, the akashic can choose one of the following abilities.

Creature Loresight			KEY:Minor Akashic Ability ~ Creature Loresight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic can use the spell creature loresight a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus as a spell-like ability.

Kinesthetic Memory			KEY:Minor Akashic Ability ~ Kinesthetic Memory				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:An akashic's sensory memory is so precise that he can easily get around with no penalty when he has a single damaged or deprived sense and is in familiar surroundings. For example, a blind akashic can move about in his home, a clothing shop he frequents, or inside a castle he has viewed extensively with magic, operating with no penalties.

Afterward, for 1 round per class level, he gains a +3 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, as well as a +3 dodge bonus to Armor Class.

Sneak Attack				KEY:Minor Akashic Ability ~ Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)ClassFeatures.AkashicClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:Using the akashic memory to remember the vital spots of other creatures, an akashic can make devastating attacks. Any time the akashic's target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the akashic flanks the target, the akashic's attack deals +1d6 extra points of damage. Should the character score a critical hit with a sneak attack, do not multiply this extra damage. The akashic can make sneak attacks with ranged weapons, but only up to a range of 30 feet.																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.41

If the champion already holds a shield in her hand when she uses this ability, she increases the enhancement bonus of the shield by +1 (if no enhancement bonus, the bonus becomes +1) as she imbues it with power. The imbued shield takes on a symbol related to her cause. Unlike a summoned shield, there is no increase of this additional enhancement bonus based on level. Starting at 11th level, the shield (summoned or imbued) negates 50 percent of the criticals the champion might suffer. From 18th level on, this critical negation power extends to all the champion's allies within 10 feet.

No one can take the weapon from her against her will, although it can be dispelled. The weapon has a +1 enhancement bonus, with an additional +1 enhancement bonus per five champion levels.

If the champion already holds a melee weapon in her hand when using this ability, she increases the weapon's enhancement bonus of by +1 (if it has no enhancement bonus, it becomes +1) as she imbues it with power. Unlike a summoned weapon, there is no level-based increase of this additional enhancement bonus. Starting at 13th level, the weapon (summoned or imbued) has the defending weapon special ability.

The champion can use this ability once per day.																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.46	SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Focused Devotion			KEY:Champion ~ Focused Devotion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.ChampionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, if the champion desires, she can take on a focused devotion-in other words, become the champion of something far more specific than the general concept embodied by her cause. The player should choose either a race, a place, or a person to champion, and this new devotion must not contradict or oppose the principles of her previous cause. A champion can choose to focus her devotion at any time after this level as well. At this point, the champion takes on the abilities gained through her focused devotion rather than from her normal cause. Thus, a champion of life who becomes a champion of giants gains blessing of the race rather than sign of life. Their avatar's allies, true shield, and true weapon abilities are based on their original cause. It is worth noting that in the context of the campaign, a champion rarely chooses her focused devotion-rather, she is usually chosen by someone else. For example, a sibeccai mystic might choose a champion to become a champion of the sibeccai "in their hour of need," or a noble lord might choose an individual to become his personal champion, acting as both a guard in times of danger and a representative when he is not present. Sometimes, though, a champion merely receives a vision or an inspired idea to become a champion with a focused devotion. A champion might choose a noble comrade with what appears to be an important destiny and become her champion-through no choice of the comrade (in fact, she might not even know). See "Focused Devotions" on page 52 for special abilities.	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	SOURCEPAGE:p.46

This new form resembles her normal physical form, but everyone around her intuitively knows she has become transformed. The champion speaks with a new voice of great resonance and authority and stands with greater stature and power. The new form adds a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, and the champion gains DR 10/+1 (or 10/magic) and SR 11 plus her champion level. These powers last for 2 rounds per champion level, and she can use this ability once per day (in addition to her uses of the call upon the power ability). Taking on the mantle is a free action. Most champions give a name to the new form (or their reputation earns them one), such as "The Lion of Righteousness" or "The Hound of Darkness." Others then speak of the new form as a different being: "He has become the Lion of Righteousness."

Avatar's Ally			KEY:Champion ~ Avatar's Ally				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.ChampionClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:The 16th-level champion can call upon the power of her cause to manifest as a magical ally to defend her in battle. It is a full-round action to call the ally, which lasts for 1 round per class level, obeying the champion's mental commands or attacking her enemies (if given no commands). The ally takes on a ghostly, flickering, quasi-amorphous form appropriate to the champion's cause. It uses Large fire elemental statistics, except that it has no vulnerability to cold. It also has special modifications and abilities unique to the champion's cause (see each cause for details). This ability can be used once each day.

Spells				KEY:Greenbond ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality		DESC:Greenbonds have access to simple spells and all spells with the plant or positive energy descriptors. A greenbond may choose to ready any spell he has access to, provided he can cast spells of that level. He readies spells ahead of time, any of which he can cast up to the maximum number of spell slots available to him for each given level. To ready or cast a spell, a greenbond must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level. The  Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a greenbond's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the greenbond's Wisdom modifier. A greenbond's spells have only verbal and mental components, which imposes no spell failure chance due to armor. Bonus spells for greenbonds are based on Wisdom.

Infuse With Life			KEY:Greenbond ~ Infuse With Life			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:A greenbond can call upon the positive energy of life and bestow that energy upon himself or another creature. With a touch, he can heal 1d8 hit points + his level a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus; greenbonds with no Wisdom bonus can use this ability once per week. At 4th level, the amount of healing increases to 2d8 points + the greenbond's level and continues to increase every three levels thereafter: 7th level 3d8 + level, 10th level 4d8 + level, 13th level 6d8 +level, 16th level 8d8 + level, 19th level 10d8 + level, 22nd level 12d8 + level, and 25th level 14d8 + level. These changes increase the amount of healing, not the number of times used. For example, if a greenbond has a Wisdom bonus of +3, when he is 1st level, he can infuse someone with life three times per day, each time healing 1d8+1 points. At 4th level, he can still heal only three times per day, but each time now heals 2d8+4 points of damage. At 25th level, the greenbond can apply one of his infuse with life uses to affect a creature as if he had cast perfect health. He cannot do this more than once per day.

Nature's Gift			KEY:Greenbond ~ Nature's Gift				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day, a 2nd-level or higher greenbond can use his connection with the Green to draw on the power of nature and infuse it within himself. He must be touching something solid and natural (the ground, a bit of unworked stone, a plant, an animal, or a beast) to activate this ability. He gains a divine bonus equal to half his level. The greenbond can add this bonus to any d20 roll he makes in the following round. He can impart this gift to an ally he touches during the following round (the ally must use the bonus in that round). He can even divide the bonus among up to five allies that he can reach during the round, giving each a portion of the bonus as he decides. Thus, a 10th-level greenbond could grant a +2 bonus to two allies and a +1 bonus to another. Starting at 12th level, the gift's divine bonus lasts 1 round per four greenbond levels (maximum 5 rounds). Thus, an 18th-level greenbond could grant a 4-round divine bonus of +9 to one ally (or himself), or +3 to three allies, or +5 to one ally and +1 to four others. Each round, those granted the gift can use the bonus on any one d20 roll of their choosing.

Bond With the Green		KEY:Greenbond ~ Bond With the Green			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level the greenbond gains the ability that gives his class its name. In a four-hour ritual that he conducts in a private setting, the greenbond gains an intuitive sense of the condition of the land-a literal bond with the Green. This means that if the land is harmed in any way (for instance, a forest fire, a famine, or a disease) within one mile per greenbond level, he becomes aware of it and gains a general understanding of what is happening. If he makes a caster power check (DC 25), he gains more details, such as distance and direction. For example, say a bestial cyclops band is hacking down trees to burn in a huge pyre. A 7th-level greenbond four miles away becomes alerted once they chop down about 25 trees. All the greenbond knows is that numerous trees are dying rapidly. If he makes his caster power check, he knows that it occurs four miles away and the direction. He still does not know specifically that the cyclops band is the culprit. In order for an event to trigger the bond, it must affect an area at least 100 yards across or involving at least 25 creatures or large plants (such as trees). Natural, daily events, such as predators hunting, do not alert the greenbond. At 15th level, the greenbond undergoes a three-day solitary trek into the wilderness, eating and drinking nothing other than special herbs and water. This experience increases his bond with the Green so that plants surrounding him infuse into his body. From that point on, he is no longer considered a humanoid (or whatever type he is), but a plant. Anything that specifically does not harm plants will not harm the greenbond. However, he remains a living, thinking creature, so mind-affecting spells work on him, and he still has a discernable anatomy, so sneak attacks and critical hits affect him. At 20th level, the greenbond undertakes a spiritwalk, communing with nature spirits for nine days, during which he is simply absent from the world. After this period of communion, he no longer need make Diplomacy checks when speaking with nature spirits-they will always speak with him willingly (see below). At 21st level, spirits actively seek out the greenbond to tell him news that is of interest or importance to him. At 23rd level, the greenbond can take the shape of a tree as a standard action, if standing on solid ground where a tree could potentially grow. There is no way to determine that the tree is actually a greenbond-even magic does not reveal him to be anything but the tree he appears to be. While a tree, the greenbond cannot move or take actions other than to cast spells or use abilities that affect only him. For example, he could cast plant armor on himself while he was a tree or use infuse with life upon himself. None of this requires movement of any kind on the part of the tree-greenbond. What's more, the greenbond must root himself in natural earth and take on the form of a tree for eight hours each day rather than sleeping. During this time, he remains completely aware of his surroundings and can change back. The eight hours need not be consecutive. Due to this transformation, the greenbond needs only sunlight, water, and the touch of the earth to sustain him. He no longer requires sleep, air, or food. At 24th level, the fusion with plants that occurred at 15th level becomes so complete that the greenbond's anatomy changes to resemble a plant. His skin takes on a greenish sheen. He no longer has a discernable anatomy and thus becomes immune to sneak attacks and critical hits.	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Percipience				KEY:Greenbond ~ Percipience				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:Starting at 6th level, greenbonds can see and hear nature spirits otherwise imperceptible to mortals (unless a spirit wishes to show itself). The character finds this ability disconcerting at first, because it makes him realize how pervasive spirits are: They are everywhere, all the time- although only rarely do they pay attention to the actions of mortals. Greenbonds sometimes become alerted to danger when the nature spirits of an area are upset or absent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.57	SOURCEPAGE:p.57
Speak With Spirits		KEY:Greenbond ~ Speak With Spirits			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:The 8th-level and higher greenbond can speak with the spirit of a tree, a brook, the air, or any other part of nature that he touches. Once per day he can ask a spirit a question with a one-word answer. Generally, only natural things have spirits-wood made into a door or water in a fountain usually has lost its spirit. The spirit is not omniscient. It knows all observable facts about its surroundings, and can answer any such question with 100 percent accuracy. For example, if a greenbond asked the spirit of a river if any people on horseback had crossed it in the last three days, it would be able to answer the question. A spirit's surroundings are never more than a 100- yard radius, however-a river miles long has many spirits. A spirit has a 75 percent chance, plus 1 percent per level of the greenbond, to know the answer to a question about things farther afield, such as, "Is the dragon still over the next hill?" It never knows the answer to a question pertaining to the future or to the thoughts of another: "Can I defeat the dragon in battle?" or "Does the dragon know I'm here?" To convince the spirit to give an answer, the greenbond must make a Diplomacy check. A failed check might result in no answer, or it might result in a lie (DM's discretion). The check's Difficulty Class depends on the type of spirit: Spirit DC	DESC: Water spirit 10; Wood spirit 15; Air spirit 18; Animal spirit 20; Stone spirit 30.	DESC: At 14th level, a greenbond can ask a question that requires an answer of up to one word per greenbond level or a series of yes/no questions-one per greenbond level.

Spiritform				KEY:Greenbond ~ Spiritform				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.GreenbondClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 17th level, the greenbond can make his body into a spiritform for up to one minute per level. Spiritform allows the greenbond to become incorporeal for the ability's duration. This ability is usable once per day.

# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type											Define			Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														Bonus to Ability Pool																Modify VAR						Source Page		Ignore Encumberance
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Mage Blade ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Mage blades are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and light armor and shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.59
Spells				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:Mage blades have access to simple spells. A mage blade may choose to ready any simple spell provided she can cast spells of that level. She readies spells ahead of time, any of which she can cast up to the maximum number of spell slots available to her for each given level. To ready or cast a spell, a mage blade must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a mage blade's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the mage blade's Charisma modifier. Bonus spells for mage blades rely on Charisma. Mage blades never gain access to 9th- or 10th-level spells. Mage blade spells always have both somatic and verbal components. Thus, these characters face spell failure chances when wearing armor. An exception to this requirement applies if the mage blade holds her key weapon in her hand(s). In such a case, her spells have only verbal components, so she suffers no spell failure chances when wearing armor. (Technically, the mage blade usually motions with the sword when casting spells, but this is not considered actual somatic components for purposes of spell failure in armor, casting spells while grappled, and so on.)																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.59
Athame				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Athame					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:AthameLVL|0	DESC:The mage blade selects a bladed weapon that she is proficient with and performs a daylong ceremony to make it her key weapon, also called an "athame." A mage blade can have only one athame, and the athame must be a physical weapon (not the creation of a spell), although it can be enhanced with magic. The athame gains a +1 enhancement bonus, which functions only in the mage blade's hands. At 4th level, and every four mage blade levels afterward, this bonus increases by +1 (maximum +5), The weapon does not have to be masterwork to use it as an athame, but if the mage blade ever wants to enhance it with weapon special abilities, such as keen or dancing, it must be masterwork. This ability provides enough of an enhancement bonus to give the blade special abilities without first giving it at least a +1 enhancement bonus using the normal item creation rules. The athame gains a small modicum of sentience in the ceremony. It has a very basic empathic link with the mage blade, so the character always knows where the weapon is (distance and direction). The athame serves as a special focus for all the mage blade's spells. As long as it remains in her hands, her spells have no somatic components. A mage blade can create a new athame by performing the ceremony again, but this results in the destruction of the previous athame, if it still exists. Starting at 6th level, the athame strikes at anyone other than the mage blade who picks it up or attempts to use it, unless the mage blade specifically commands it not to. The weapon strikes once per round until dropped, using the mage blade's attack bonuses. Resolve the attack as if the mage blade were wielding the weapon. Beginning at 9th level, the mage blade can summon her athame to appear immediately in her hand as a standard action. The weapon can be up to 10 miles per class level away, although if it is in someone else's possession or in a locked room, the mage blade must make a caster power check (DC 25) to summon it. Starting at 14th level, this summons becomes a free action, usable once per round. A mage blade with a double weapon as her athame only enjoys the benefits granted by this ability on one end of the weapon.																				BONUS:VAR|AthameLVL|1+(MageBladeLVL>13)	SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Shimmering Shield			KEY:Mage Blade ~ Shimmering Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality					DESC:The 4th-level and higher mage blade can call a magical shield to surround her like a shimmering aura. This shield provides a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class per four class levels and does not require the mage blade to wield it as a shield (she keeps both hands free). The shimmering shield can be called upon, as a standard action, once per day for 1 round per level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Bonus Feats				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Bonus Feats				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 5th level, the mage blade gets a bonus feat. The mage blade gains an additional bonus feat at 10th level, and another at 15th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, and 24th level. These are in addition to the feats a character gets every third level. Draw these bonus feats from the following list: Armor Proficiency (Heavy), Armor Proficiency (Medium), Bloody Strike, Bonded Item, Combat Reflexes, Complex Spell*, Defensive Move (Mobility), Defensive Stance, Defensive Unarmed Strike, Expertise (Improved Disarm, Improved Trip), Exotic Armor Proficiency, Exotic Weapon Proficiency*, Exotic Spell*, Hunter Mage, Improved Critical*, Improved Initiative, Modify Spell, Point Blank Shot (Far Shot, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run), Psion, Quick Draw, Rapid Strike, Stunning Blow, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*. Some of these feats are ceremonial feats. The character need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it) to get a bonus ceremonial feat; even an Unbound character can choose a ceremonial bonus feat in this way. A mage blade cannot acquire some of these bonus feats until she has gained one or more prerequisite feats; these feats appear parenthetically after the prerequisite feat. A mage blade can select feats marked with an asterisk (*) more than once, but it must be for a different weapon, spell, or spell level (depending on the feat) each time. The character must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums (but not truenames).

Slice Through Wardings		KEY:Mage Blade ~ Slice Through Wardings		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality					DESC:Once per day per class level, starting at 11th level, the mage blade can ignore all magic-based protections (Armor Class bonuses, defensive field, and so on) on a foe in a single attack made with her athame. The mage blade cannot use this ability to ignore spells or effects that take effect when a foe is attacked, such as feedback strike. The character must declare her use of this ability before making the attack.

SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Spell Parry				KEY:Mage Blade ~ Spell Parry				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality					DESC:A 16th-level and higher mage blade gains the ability to parry spells. The mage blade must have her athame in hand to parry a spell. Only spells targeting the mage blade alone can be parried-not area spells or spells targeted elsewhere. The mage blade makes an attack roll opposed by the caster's caster power check. If the mage blade's roll is higher, the spell fails to affect her at all. The mage blade can parry only spells she is aware of; spells from invisible casters or those casting mental-action only spells cannot be parried. No more than one spell can be parried in a round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Slice Through Spells		KEY:Mage Blade ~ Slice Through Spells		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality					DESC:Once per day, beginning at 18th level, the mage blade can strike a non-instantaneous spell effect or creation (a summoned monster, an eldritch wall, an illusion, an area of obscuring mist, and so on) with her athame and dispel it as if she had cast dispel magic using her class level as the caster level. A mage blade cannot dispel effects on a creature (like dominate or sorcerous guise), only "stand-alone" effects. Even spells not normally subject to dispel magic can be affected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Athame Critical			KEY:Mage Blade ~ Athame Critical			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 22nd level and above, when the mage blade makes an attack roll that falls into the natural threat range of the athame (not modified by magic or feats such as Improved Critical), the critical hit is automatically confirmed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Athame Burst			KEY:Mage Blade ~ Athame Burst				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)ClassFeatures.Mage BladeClassFeatures.SpecialQuality					DESC:The 25th-level mage blade can, using a full attack action, spin around with her athame and send replicas of the blade, composed of magical energy, toward all foes within 30 feet. The mage blade makes a separate melee attack roll against each foe, using her highest attack bonus. Each successful attack inflicts damage as if the mage blade struck the foe with the athame. The mage blade can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. If she has no Charisma bonus, she can use this ability once per week.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Magister ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Magister Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Magisters are skilled with no weapons except staves; at 5th level, magisters acquire proficiency in sword staves as well.

Spells				KEY:Magister ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Magister Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A magister’s primary focus is casting spells. These characters have access to simple and complex spells. A magister is limited to a certain number of spells of each spell level per day, according to his class level. A magister may choose to ready any simple or complex spell, provided he can cast spells of that level. He readies spells ahead of time, any of which he can cast according to the maximum number of spell slots available to him for each given level. To ready or cast a spell, a magister must have a Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a magister’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the magister’s Intelligence modifier. Bonus spells for magisters rely on Intelligence. Magister spells always have both somatic and verbal components. Thus, magisters face spell failure chances when wearing armor. A magister needs his staff (see below) as a focus to cast spells. Without it, treat his caster level as one level lower and double casting times for all spells (standard-action spells become fullround spells, full-round spells take 2 rounds to cast, and so on).																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.62
The Magister’s Staff		KEY:Magister ~ The Magister’s Staff				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Magister Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:The magister crafts a staff specifically attuned to him. Regardless of its construction or composition, it has a hardness of 12, 50 hit points, and a break DC of 30. The staff ’s hit points increase at a rate of 2 per magister level, and the hardness and break Difficulty Class increase at a rate of 1 point per three magister levels. If a magister’s staff breaks, he is stunned for 1d4 rounds. It takes a month and 1,000 gp in materials to create a new one. A magister can have only one staff attuned to him at a time. If the character finds a new staff he would rather become attuned to, switching staves requires no money. However, it does take a week of meditation. Should the magister die or take on a new staff, the old staff becomes normal (unless it had been given other magical properties, in which case they remain). A slain magister who comes back from the dead can immediately and automatically re-attune to his old staff as a free action.

Some of these feats are ceremonial feats. The character need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it) to get a bonus ceremonial feat; even an Unbound character can choose a ceremonial bonus feat in this way. A magister can select feats marked with an asterisk (*) more than once, but it must be for a different spell descriptor or spell level (depending on the feat) each time.

Lesser Mind Over Matter		KEY:Magister ~ Lesser Mind Over Matter			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Magister Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 14th level and beyond, a magister can use his uncanny intellect, coupled with secrets learned while studying magic, to gain an advantage in situations that usually demand brute force. In situations requiring a Strength check, he can make an Intelligence check instead. For example, when he must force open a stuck door, the magister can make an Intelligence check to best position himself for leverage and recall some secret knowledge about the magic stored within the wood of the door to get it open. This ability never affects attack or damage rolls, except that, when making an opposed grapple check to avoid being grappled, the magister can use his Intelligence modifier rather than his Strength modifier.

Unarmed Strike			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Unarmed Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:OathswornDamageTier|0	DESC:An oathsworn fighting unarmed does not provoke attacks of opportunity from armed opponents that she attacks. When an oathsworn is using unarmed strike, she doesn’t have the option of making an off-hand attack, as she uses her whole body in every attack. On the rare occasion that the character might be fighting with a one-handed weapon, she can make an unarmed strike as an off-hand attack but suffers the standard penalties for two-weapon fighting. Usually, an oathsworn’s unarmed strikes deal normal damage rather than subdual damage. However, she can choose to deal her damage as subdual without penalty. An oathsworn with natural weapons uses her unarmed strike attack bonus and damage with those natural weapons, or the normal natural weapon attack bonus and damage, whichever is greater.

Swear an Oath			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Swear an Oath				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:An oathsworn must always work toward fulfilling an oath. To swear an oath, she names—very specifically—a task she will accomplish in no more than one year’s time. If the task is not completed in that time, or if conditions arise that indicate the failure of the oath, the oathsworn loses all class abilities for one month. After that month, the oathsworn must swear an oath again (it can be the same oath). An oathsworn who loses her class abilities three times loses them forever. An oathsworn cannot be tricked into thinking an oath is fulfilled when it is not, and no magical compulsion can force her to stop attempting to fulfill it. An oathsworn gains a +4 luck bonus to Spot or Sense Motive checks against any attempt to fool her about part of an oath (giving her an imposter to protect when she has sworn to guard a person, for example). An oathsworn who successfully fulfills her oath must immediately swear a new one. If she does not, she loses all class abilities until she does—which means an oathsworn could “retire” after fulfilling an oath, then suddenly regain her powers, years later, when she swears a new oath. Oaths can be singular tasks (destroy Tower Nestran) or ongoing (keep Daerial Daymaker alive). Ongoing oaths can be renewed at the end of each year. An oath must be something measurable, so the character knows whether it has been fulfilled. If Tower Nestran still stands after one year, or if Daerial Daymaker dies, the oathsworn who made those oaths clearly failed. If the tower lies in ruins or if Daerial remains alive at the end of the year (never having died at any point during the year), the oaths were fulfilled and the oathsworn successful. It is crucial that the player of an oathsworn character work out the details of her oath with the DM. The DM should make sure that the oath does not run counter to the direction of the campaign or prevent the character from taking part in planned adventures.

Eschew Food				KEY:Oathsworn ~ Eschew Food				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 2nd level and higher, an oathsworn no longer needs to eat to survive. She simply refuses to let her body be bound to such requirements. To survive she needs only water (and air to breathe, of course).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Shattering Blow			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Shattering Blow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 2nd level and higher, the oathsworn can take a full-round action to make a single powerful strike with the full force of her oath behind it. The unarmed strike ignores 1 point of a creature’s damage reduction for each oathsworn class level. So a 3rd-level oathsworn ignores 3 points of damage reduction. This ability also applies to object hardness and extends to makeshift weapons that the oathsworn forms from handy objects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Evasion				KEY:Oathsworn ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:If a 3rd-level or higher oathsworn makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion applies only if the oathsworn wears light armor or no armor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Combat Rites			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Combat Rites				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Starting at 4th level, the oathsworn gains access to combat rites, special abilities that stem from the ritualization of combat (see Chapter Nine). Similar to the way in which a spellcaster casts spells, an oathsworn can activate a certain number of combat rites of a given rank per day, based on her level. The oathsworn can use any combat rite, as long as she can use rites of that rank. To use a combat rite, the oathsworn must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the rite’s rank. Combat rites do not require components, do not have a failure chance based on armor worn, and cannot be dispelled or suppressed. They are not magical. The oathsworn gains bonus combat rites based on her Wisdom score (see “Bonus Spells and Combat Rites” in Chapter One).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Fast Movement (Ex/Su)		KEY:Oathsworn ~ Fast Movement				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 4th level and higher (3rd level for Tiny and Small characters), an oathsworn moves faster than normal. An oathsworn in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. A Small or Tiny oathsworn moves more slowly than a Medium oathsworn. (See the size-based table on this page.) From 10th level on, the oathsworn’s fast movement ability actually becomes a supernatural ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Throw Object			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Throw Object				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Starting at 4th level, an oathsworn can use any object she can lift above her head as a ranged (thrown) weapon she is proficient with. The object must weigh at least 1 lb. to use it as a ranged weapon. She uses her normal attack bonus and unarmed damage, and the weapon has a range increment of 10 feet. She uses this only against foes she cannot reach or otherwise harm with her unarmed strikes. Assume that, unless the object is particularly sturdy, it breaks when thrown.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Lesser Adaptation			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Lesser Adaptation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 4th level and above, the oathsworn can ignore ongoing damaging environmental effects of up to 1 point of damage per round. This includes damage from exposure in the hot desert, but not damage from directed attacks, like a fireburst spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Refuse Fatigue			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Refuse Fatigue			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 5th level and beyond, the oathsworn does not tire. As long as she gets a good night’s rest (eight hours), she never feels the effects of fatigue. She could run at her top speed all day and not tire.

SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Objects as Weapons		KEY:Oathsworn ~ Objects as Weapons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Rarely, an oathsworn faces a foe her fists cannot overcome or one that would be foolish to touch (a caustic ooze or a fire elemental). In such cases, a 6th-level and higher oathsworn can use any object she can lift over her head as a weapon she is proficient with. The object must weigh at least 1 lb. to use it as a weapon. She uses her normal attack bonus and unarmed damage. The DM should pay close attention to the sturdiness of the object. Although the oathsworn can inflict surprising damage with harmless-looking objects, this ability does not grant the object any special strength. Many objects will break when used as weapons. Some objects, at the DM’s discretion, might grant special abilities. For example, a character might wield a rope as a whip and use it to make trip attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Lesser Shattering Strike	KEY:Oathsworn ~ Lesser Shattering Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Beginning at 7th level, an oathsworn empowers every unarmed attack she makes with the full strength of her oath. The unarmed strike ignores 1 point of a creature’s damage reduction for every two oathsworn class levels. So a 7th-level oathsworn ignores 3 points of damage reduction. This ability also applies to object hardness and extends to makeshift weapons that the oathsworn forms from handy objects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Refuse Wounds			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Refuse Wounds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Starting at 9th level, an oathsworn can cure her own wounds.

SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Eschew Water			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Eschew Water				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 8th level and beyond, an oathsworn no longer needs even water to survive. Other than air to breathe, the oathsworn requires nothing—such things only distract from the oath.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Oathpower				KEY:Oathsworn ~ Oathpower				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Starting at 10th level, the oathsworn gains further ability to fulfill her oath through incredible dedication.

SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Greater Adaptation		KEY:Oathsworn ~ Greater Adaptation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 13th level and beyond, after studying a given situation, environment, or area for 1 round, the oathsworn can ignore any circumstance penalties placed on attack and damage rolls, checks, and saves due to the conditions of that area for the next 10 rounds. For example, after contemplating for a round, an oathsworn can make attacks underwater at no penalty. She can walk across a slick, slippery ledge with no circumstance penalties placed upon her Balance checks. Further, for that time, the oathsworn can ignore ongoing damaging effects of up to 10 points of damage per round. This includes damage from running through a burning building, but not damage from directed attacks, like a dragon’s breath weapon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Eschew Sleep			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Eschew Sleep				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 14th level and higher, an oathsworn does not need sleep.

Greater Shattering Strike	KEY:Oathsworn ~ Greater Shattering Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 16th level and beyond, an oathsworn’s ability to empower her unarmed attacks increases. Each unarmed strike she makes ignores 1 point of a creature’s damage reduction for every class level. So a 16th-level oathsworn ignores 16 points of damage reduction. This ability also applies to object hardness and extends to makeshift weapons that the oathsworn forms from handy objects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Eschew Aging			KEY:Oathsworn ~ Eschew Aging				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:After achieving 17th level, an oathsworn no longer suffers ability penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged.

Refuse Debilitation		KEY:Oathsworn ~ Refuse Debilitation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 17th level and beyond, the oathsworn is not subject to ability score damage or energy drain.

Oathstrike				KEY:Oathsworn ~ Oathstrike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Once per week, in a fight that directly pertains to the fulfillment of the oath (DM’s discretion), the 18thlevel or higher oathsworn can make a mighty unarmed blow that acts as a coup de grace against an opponent, even one who is not helpless. This is a full-round action. Creatures with no discernable anatomy (those normally immune to critical strikes or sneak attacks) are immune to oathstrike. Starting at 23rd level, she can make an oathstrike once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.69
True Adaptation			KEY:Oathsworn ~ True Adaptation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A 19th-level or higher oathsworn reduces all circumstance penalties to attack and damage rolls, checks, and saves by 4 points. Further, the oathsworn can ignore ongoing damaging effects of up to 10 points of damage per round. This includes damage from crossing a frozen tundra without winter gear, but not damage from directed attacks, like a dragon’s breath weapon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Refuse Harm				KEY:Oathsworn ~ Refuse Harm				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Su)Oathsworn Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:The 20th-level and higher oathsworn’s devotion is so strong that her flesh turns away blades and barbs. The oathsworn gains DR 5/+1 (or 5/magic). At 24th level, the damage reduction becomes 10/+2 (or 10/magic).

Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Ritual Warrior ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ritual Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:The ritual warrior is proficient with all simple and martial weapons; light, medium, and heavy armors; and shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Combat Rites					KEY:Ritual Warrior ~ Combat Rites						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ritual Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Starting at 1st level, the ritual warrior gains access to combat rites, special abilities that stem from the ritualization of combat (see Chapter Nine). Similar to the way in which a spellcaster casts spells, a ritual warrior can activate a certain number of combat rites of a given rank per day, based on his level. The ritual warrior can use any combat rite, as long as he can use rites of that rank. To use a combat rite, the ritual warrior must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the rite’s rank. Combat rites do not require components, do not have a failure chance based on armor worn, and cannot be dispelled or suppressed. They are not magical. The ritual warrior gains bonus combat rites based on his Wisdom score (see “Bonus Spells and Combat Rites” in Chapter One: Abilities).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Bonus Feats						KEY:Ritual Warrior ~ Bonus Feats						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ritual Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 1st level, the ritual warrior gets a bonus feat. The ritual warrior gains an additional bonus feat at 4th level, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, and 25th as well. These are in addition to the feats a character gets every third level. Draw these bonus feats from the following list: Bloody Strike, Combat Reflexes, Defensive Move (Mobility), Exotic Armor Proficiency, Exotic Weapon Proficiency*, Expertise (Defensive Move, Defensive Stance, Improved Disarm, Improved Trip, Whirlwind Attack), Improved Critical*, Improved Initiative, Point Blank Shot (Far Shot, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run), Power Attack (Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Sunder), Quick Draw, Stunning Blow, Sturdy, Tough Hide, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*, Weapon Specialization*. Some of these feats are ceremonial feats. The character need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it) to get a bonus ceremonial feat; even an Unbound character can choose a ceremonial feat in this way. The ritual warrior cannot acquire some of these bonus feats until he has gained one or more prerequisite feats; these feats appear parenthetically after the prerequisite feat. A ritual warrior can select feats marked with an asterisk (*) more than once, but it must be for a different weapon each time. The character still must meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums (but not truenames).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.70
Ability Score Bonus				KEY:Ritual Warrior ~ Ability Score Bonus					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ritual Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 2nd level, and at 9th, 17th, and 25th level thereafter, the ritual warrior can perform a special ceremony that increases one ability score by +1. This increase is identical to—but in addition to—the ability score increase that all characters gain every four levels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.70
Concentration Save				KEY:Ritual Warrior ~ Concentration Save					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ritual Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 5th level and above, when the ritual warrior must make a saving throw, he can choose to call upon his inner energies and make a Concentration check instead. He must choose to make a check rather than a standard save before any dice are rolled. Standard bonuses that normally apply to saves (such as a resistance spell) do not apply, although magic that affects checks (like canny effort) can apply. He can use this option once per day for every five levels.

# Runethane
Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Runethane ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Runethane Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Runethanes are proficient with all simple weapons but no armor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Runes							KEY:Runethane ~ Runes								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)Runethane Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Runes resemble arcane symbols. They are usually meaningless to anyone without the Knowledge (runes) skill. Runethanes apply a rune by magically drawing a symbol on an object, surface, or creature. It is a full-round action to create a rune, and no rune can be used more than once per hour. A runethane can have a total value of runes in existence at any given time equal to his level. Lesser runes each have a value of 1, which counts against this total. Advanced runes each have a value of 2, greater runes a value of 3, and runes of power a value of 4. There are three kinds of rune: touch-trigger runes, applied runes, and enchanted object runes. A touch-trigger rune is placed upon an object or a surface, but not a creature. Basically, the rune can cover a surface as small as 1 inch square and as large as 10 feet square; multiple runes can cover a much larger area. The first creature that touches the object or surface bearing the rune triggers the effect immediately. Touch-trigger runes last until triggered, dispelled, or erased by the runethane. If circumstances result in a creature triggering more than one touch-trigger rune at once, only the most powerful one takes effect. The others are triggered but have no effect. A runethane can choose to create a touch-trigger rune as a visible rune or as invisible. If a character (including the runethane) wishes to trigger a touch-triggered rune intentionally, it requires a standard action to do so. An applied rune requires the runethane to apply it to activate its effects immediately—usually effects related to the object, surface, or creature it is placed upon. Applied runes last only as long as their effects. They are always visible. Enchanted object runes require the runethane to apply the rune to an object no larger than himself. These imbue the item bearing the rune with a magical ability. Enchanted object runes last for one day per runethane level. They are visible except where stated otherwise. Anyone looking upon a visible rune can determine what it does by making a Knowledge (runes) check. The DC is 15 for lesser runes, 18 for advanced runes, 21 for greater runes, 25 for runes of power, and 30 to identify the ultimate rune and what it does. No more than one rune of a specific type can affect an area, person, or object. Thus, a door cannot receive two runes of blasting. If a spell level requirement is ever needed, treat lesser runes as 2nd-level spells, advanced as 4th-level, greater as 6th, runes of power as 8th, and the ultimate rune as 9th level. Use the runethane’s class level as his caster level. A runethane always knows his current rune total, so even if one of his runes is triggered out of his normal perception, he is aware that his potential rune maximum has increased (but he gains no information beyond that).																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Spells						KEY:Runethane ~ Spells								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Runethane Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Runethanes have access to simple spells. A runethane may choose to ready any simple spell, provided he can cast spells of that level. He readies spells ahead of time, any of which he can cast according to the maximum number of spell slots available to him for each given level. To ready or cast a spell, a runethane must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 plus the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a runethane’s spell is 10 plus the spell’s level, plus the runethane’s Intelligence modifier. Bonus spells for runethanes rely on Intelligence. Runethanes never gain access to 9th- or 10th-level spells. Runethane spells always have both somatic and verbal components. Thus, they face spell failure chances when wearing armor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Runic Template					KEY:Runethane ~ Runic Template						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Runethane Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Runethanes can add the runic template to spells they cast if they wish. (See Chapter Eight: Magic.)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Lesser Runes					KEY:Runethane ~ Lesser Runes							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Runethane Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Each time the runethane gains this ability (at 1st through 5th levels), he learns a new lesser rune from the list below. At 1st level, the runethane starts with two runes. Each lesser rune he creates counts as one rune toward his total (which is equal to his level). It is a full-round action to create a lesser rune.

Totem Animal Companion				KEY:Totem Warrior ~ Totem Animal Companion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Totem Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 3rd level, the totem warrior gains a special animal companion imbued with the direct manifestation of the totem she reveres. The animal appears first in a dream, and then—if the totem warrior is in or near its natural habitat—she finds it waiting for her when she wakes up. If the character does not treat the animal well—as a companion, not a slave—the animal leaves. The animal’s loyalty is natural (not magical) and lasting. The character can teach the totem animal three specific and even fairly complex tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Examples include fetching an item or carrying a message. From 3rd level on, the animal gains a Hit Die with each class level the character advances, along with all the subsequent benefits that entails—better saves, attack bonus, and so on. Further, for every four levels it advances, the animal may raise one ability score by 1 point (like a character) and increase its Intelligence score by 1. If the animal dies, a new animal will come to the totem warrior in 1d10 + 10 days, if the warrior spends that time in the animal’s natural environment. The new animal has the stats of the animal that died, and it continues gaining Hit Dice as the character gains levels.

The totem warrior’s original body remains undisturbed. In animal form, the totem warrior can take whatever actions she wishes, perhaps avenging her death and remaining in the animal form forever or attempting to restore her real body back to life (at which point her animal body disappears). No magic, other than that which will restore the dead to life, can transform the animal form of the warrior back to her original form. If the totem warrior’s new animal form dies, she is simply dead (as normal).

12th Level - Hypnotism				KEY:Totem Warrior (Snake) ~ Hypnotism					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)Totem Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:The snake totem warrior’s mesmerizing stare causes one or two creatures within 30 feet to stop and stare blankly at her, hypnotized, for 2d4 rounds unless they make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half the totem warrior’s class levels + totem warrior’s Charisma bonus). The snake warrior can use their rapt attention to make her suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Only creatures that can see the snake warrior are affected. They do not need to understand her language to be hypnotized. If the warrior uses this ability in combat, the targets gain a +2 bonus to their saving throws. If the hypnosis affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of –2. While hypnotized, a creature suffers a –4 penalty to Spot and Listen checks. Any potential threat allows the creature a second saving throw. Any obvious threat automatically breaks the hypnotism, as does shaking or slapping the creature. A hypnotized creature’s ally may shake it free of the hypnosis as a standard action. While the subject is hypnotized, the snake totem warrior can make a suggestion or request (provided she can communicate with it), which the subject will carry out to the best of his ability. The suggestion must be brief and reasonable—a subject will not harm himself or his friends. The suggested course of activity can continue for up to one hour. If the subject can complete the suggested activity in a shorter time, the effect ends when he finishes what the snake warrior asked him to do. The warrior can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition does not occur before the duration expires, the hypnotized creature does not perform the activity. A very reasonable suggestion causes the hypnotized creature to attempt the save with a penalty (such as –1, –2, etc.), at the DM’s discretion. Even once the hypnosis ends, the affected creature reacts to the snake warrior as though she were two steps more friendly than her actual attitude. A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that the snake warrior hypnotized it. The snake warrior can use this ability once per day.

In addition, the snake totem warrior gains the Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization feats for this natural weapon attack (giving the attack a +1 bonus and the damage a +2 bonus). The bite carries with it a virulent venom that inflicts 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage as primary and secondary damage, with a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half the snake totem warrior’s class levels + her Constitution modifier). She has enough venom for a number of bites each day equal to her Constitution bonus. If she has no Constitution bonus, she can produce only enough venom to inject once per week.

Parry							KEY:Unfettered ~ Parry								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:An armed unfettered uses his skill and training to judge the timing of an opponent’s incoming strike and how to block it. The unfettered can choose to add his Intelligence modifier to his Armor Class against a single opponent in a given round, although this bonus can never exceed half the unfettered’s class level (minimum 1). The parry ability works only against melee attacks, and only against attacks the unfettered is aware of; he cannot parry an invisible opponent. Certain weapons, such as the main gauche, add to the unfettered’s ability to parry, granting an additional bonus to the Armor Class bonus gained.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Bonus Feats						KEY:Unfettered ~ Bonus Feats							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 2nd level, the unfettered gets a bonus feat. The unfettered gains an additional bonus feat at 6th level, plus 10th, 14th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd, and 25th level. This is in addition to the feats characters normally get every third level. Draw these bonus feats from the following list: Bloody Strike, Combat Reflexes, Defensive Move (Mobility), Defensive Stance, Defensive Unarmed Strike, Expertise (Improved Disarm, Improved Trip, Whirlwind Attack), Improved Critical*, Improved Initiative, Low Blow, Modify Combat Style, Paralyzing Blow, Point Blank Shot (Far Shot, Precise Shot, Shot on the Run), Quick Draw, Rapid Strike, Stunning Blow, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus*. Some of these feats are ceremonial feats. The character need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it) to get a bonus ceremonial feat; even an Unbound character can acquire ceremonial bonus feats in this way. An unfettered cannot acquire some of these bonus feats until he has gained one or more prerequisite feats; these feats appear parenthetically after the prerequisite feat. The unfettered can select feats marked with an asterisk (*) more than once, but it must be for a different weapon each time. The character still must meet all prerequisites for a feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums (but not truenames).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Sneak Attack					KEY:Unfettered ~ Sneak Attack							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Starting at 4th level, any time the unfettered’s target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the unfettered flanks the target, the unfettered’s attack deals extra damage. The extra damage is +1d6 at 4th level and an additional 1d6 every four levels thereafter. Should the character score a critical hit with a sneak attack, do not multiply this extra damage. The unfettered can make sneak attacks with ranged weapons, but only up to a range of 30 feet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Parry Ranged Attacks				KEY:Unfettered ~ Parry Ranged Attacks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A 7th-level or higher unfettered can choose to add his Intelligence modifier to his Armor Class against a single foe who is using ranged attacks against him in a given round. Parry ranged attacks works only against ranged attacks and cannot be used in the same round as a normal parry. It works only against attacks the unfettered is aware of—he can’t parry an invisible opponent—and only against physical attacks (not spells or spell-like abilities) that the DM deems the unfettered could knock away with his weapon. For example, a human unfettered could not parry a boulder rolling down a hill or fired from a catapult.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Evasion						KEY:Unfettered ~ Evasion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 9th level the unfettered gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the unfettered takes no damage following a successful saving throw. The character can use evasion only if he is wearing light armor or no armor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Parry Magic						KEY:Unfettered ~ Parry Magic							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 13th level, the unfettered gains the ability to avoid spells in a manner similar to, but not as well as, a mage blade. He must have a magic weapon in hand to parry a spell. Only spells targeting the unfettered alone can be parried— not area spells or spells targeted elsewhere. Spells that do not allow a saving throw cannot be parried. The unfettered makes an attack roll opposed by the caster’s caster power check. If the unfettered’s roll is higher, he gains a +4 competence bonus on the saving throw against the spell. The unfettered can parry only spells he is aware of; spells from invisible casters or mental-action only spells cannot be parried. He cannot parry a spell in the same round that he uses either parry ranged attacks or a standard parry, and he cannot parry more than one spell in a round. Weapons that add an additional parry bonus do not affect the unfettered’s ability to parry magic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Enhanced Parry Weapon				KEY:Unfettered ~ Enhanced Parry Weapon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:In the hands of an unfettered of 17th level or higher, a weapon with a parry modifier offers a bonus 1 point higher than its normal modifier. Thus, a 17th-level unfettered character using a main gauche while fighting defensively gains an additional +3 Armor Class bonus, rather than +2.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Improved Evasion					KEY:Unfettered ~ Improved Evasion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 19th level, the unfettered’s evasion ability improves.

Parry All						KEY:Unfettered ~ Parry All							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 21st level, the unfettered can add his Intelligence modifier to Armor Class (as well as any weapon parry bonus) against all incoming attacks that he is aware of, as described under the parry and parry ranged attacks abilities. He still cannot use the parry magic ability in the same round that he parries conventional attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.88
True Parry						KEY:Unfettered ~ True Parry							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Unfettered Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 25th level, the unfettered can not only use his parry all ability in the same round that he attempts to use parry magic, but he can attempt to parry any number of incoming spells as well.

SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Bonus Feats						KEY:Warmain ~ Bonus Feats							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warmain Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 2nd level, the warmain gets a bonus feat. The warmain gains an additional bonus feat at 6th level, plus 10th, 14th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd, and 25th level. These are in addition to the feat that all characters get every third level. Draw these bonus feats from the following list: Bloody Strike, Combat Reflexes, Exotic Armor Proficiency, Exotic Weapon Proficiency*, Great Fortitude, Flail Defense, Improved Critical*, Mighty Unarmed Strike, Mounted Combat (Ride-By Attack, Trample), Power Attack (Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Power Charge, Sunder), Ritual Combat, Shield Specialization, Stomp, Stunning Blow, Sturdy, Tough Hide, Trample, Two-Weapon Fighting (Massive Two-Weapon Fighting), Weapon Focus*, Weapon Specialization*. Some of these feats are ceremonial feats. The character need not go through the ceremony (or pay for it) to get a bonus ceremonial feat; even Unbound characters can acquire ceremonial bonus feats in this way. A warmain cannot acquire some of these bonus feats until she has gained one or more prerequisite feats; these feats are listed parenthetically after the prerequisite feat. A warmain can select feats marked with an asterisk (*) more than once, but it must be for a different weapon each time. The character still must meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums (but not truenames).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Weapon Specialization				KEY:Warmain ~ Weapon Specialization						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Warmain Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:On achieving 4th level, the warmain gains the Weapon Specialization feat with a melee weapon of her choice. Weapon Specialization adds a +2 damage bonus with the chosen weapon. The warmain needs to have Weapon Focus with that weapon to gain Weapon Specialization.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Crushing Blow					KEY:Warmain ~ Crushing Blow							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Warmain Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Once per day, the 8th-level and higher warmain can choose to channel great physical power into a single blow in melee combat (which can be a part of either a full attack or a single attack action). The attack, if successful, inflicts damage as if the weapon inflicted a critical hit—even if striking a foe normally immune to critical hits. If the crushing blow attack inflicts an actual critical hit, increase the critical’s multiplier by +1; thus, a longsword inflicts a × 3 critical hit, while a greataxe inflicts a × 4 critical hit. If the crushing blow attack misses, the ability is still considered used for that day. A crushing blow does not trigger special effects that occur only when critical hits occur, such as the decapitating power of a vorpal weapon. Starting at 15th level, the warmain can make two crushing blow attacks per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Armor Specialization				KEY:Warmain ~ Armor Specialization						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Warmain Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:The 12th-level and higher warmain becomes proficient at moving so as to allow her armor to deflect the most possible force from each attack. The armor bonus for any armor the warmain uses increases by +1 for light and medium armor and +2 for heavy armor. So plate armor provides the warmain a +10 armor bonus rather than +8. Enhancement bonuses on the armor are not affected.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Combat Rites					KEY:Warmain ~ Combat Rites							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warmain Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:Starting at 13th level, the warmain gains access to combat rites, special abilities that stem from the ritualization of combat (see Chapter Nine). Similar to the way a spellcaster casts spells, a warmain can activate a certain number of combat rites of a given rank per day, based on her level. The warmain can use any combat rite, as long as she can use rites of that rank. To use a combat rite, the warmain must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the rite’s rank. Combat rites do not require components, do not have a failure chance based on armor worn, and cannot be dispelled or suppressed. They are not magical. The warmain gains bonus combat rites based on her Wisdom score (see “Bonus Spells and Combat Rites” in Chapter One).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Weapon Size Increase				KEY:Warmain ~ Weapon Size Increase						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Warmain Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Warmains of 16th level and beyond can use weapons one size category larger than themselves as one-handed weapons, and two size categories larger than themselves as two-handed weapons. Thus, a verrik warmain could use a greatsword in one hand (with a shield) or a giant’s sword in both hands.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Weapon Mastery					KEY:Warmain ~ Weapon Mastery							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Ex)Warmain Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:The 20th-level and higher warmain advances in the skills learned with Weapon Specialization, increasing the damage bonus to +4 rather than +2. The weapon chosen need not be the same weapon the character uses with Weapon Specialization, but the warmain still must have Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon.

# Witch
Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Witch ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:Witches are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, and shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.92
Spells						KEY:Witch ~ Spells								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:Although spellcasting is not their primary focus— witchery is—witches still have access to simple spells. A witch may choose to ready any simple spell, provided he can cast spells of that level. He readies spells ahead of time, any of which he can cast up to the maximum number of spell slots available to him for each given level. To ready or cast a spell, a witch must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a witch’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the witch’s Wisdom modifier. Bonus spells for witches are based on Wisdom. Witches never gain access to 9th- or 10th-level spells. Witch spells always have somatic, verbal, and material components. Thus, they face spell failure chances when wearing armor. A witch can choose to forgo the components, but his spells become more difficult to cast.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.92
Material Components				KEY:Witch ~ Material Components						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A witch must use strange odds and ends called material components to focus the power of magic. These can include bits of a spider’s web, handfuls of dust, glass beads, the wing of a bat, and so on. If the witch has his component pouch (or “witchbag”) with him, assume he has any necessary components when he needs them. If he does not have his witchbag, the witch can attempt to use items around him to produce makeshift material components, assuming the player can convince the DM the material is appropriate. A scoop of dust from a bookshelf might be appropriate for gentle repose (sprinkled over the corpse), and a tindertwig might work for a fiery energy bolt. Material components are not specific to each spell but must simply have some logical connection with the effect. Without material components, double the casting time for all a witch’s spells. (So, spells with a casting time of one standard action would take a full round to cast.) Should the witch not use verbal and somatic components either, double the casting time again (don’t triple it). For example, a spell’s casting time of one standard action becomes 2 rounds when a witch uses no components. In this case, the entire spellcasting process becomes only a mental action. Spells cast without verbal or somatic components in this way—by witches only—are considered to have the psionic descriptor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.93
Witchery						KEY:Witch ~ Witchery								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:(Sp)Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A witch’s primary focus is the direct expression of his inner magical power.

The witch may select an additional witchery manifestation every five levels thereafter (at 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, and 25th).

Air Spirit						KEY:Witch ~ Air Spirit								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:The wind witch can call upon a spirit of air to hold a creature or object aloft. The creature or object must weigh less than 20 lbs. per witch level. The air spirit can move its load up to 10 feet per round in any direction (including up), as commanded by the witch. Unwilling creatures can make a Fortitude saving throw to avoid being picked up (DC 10 + half the witch’s level + witch’s Wisdom modifier). Once picked up, a creature can attempt a grapple check or an Escape Artist check (DC 10 + half the witch’s level + witch’s Wisdom modifier) once per round to escape. The spirit lasts for a number of rounds equal to her witch level + her Wisdom bonus (if the witch has no bonus, add nothing). The witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus (if the witch has no bonus, she can use this ability once per week). It is a standard action to call upon the spirit and a move action to command it to move. The object or creature moved can never be more than 50 feet away from the witch.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.93
Armor Song						KEY:Witch ~ Armor Song								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:The iron witch can sing a song that weaves a sheath of magical, weightless armor around himself. He can move freely and suffers no armor check, spell failure, or movement penalties. The armor adds to his Armor Class an armor bonus equal to his Wisdom modifier + an additional enhancement bonus equal to +1 per five witch levels. Singing an armor song is a full-round action, but the armor lasts until dispelled; it does not remain in place when the witch is asleep or unconscious.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.94
Chill Spirit					KEY:Witch ~ Chill Spirit							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:The winter witch can cause a target to become shaken as a standard action. A shaken character takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. The target must be within 50 feet and within line of sight. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + half the witch’s level + witch’s Wisdom modifier) negates the effect. Those failing their saves are affected for 1 round per witch level. At 10th level and above, the winter witch can use this ability to make creatures panicked rather than shaken, if she so chooses. A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature suffers a –2 penalty on saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape. The winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus + once per four levels of witch (if the witch has no bonus, she can use this ability once per week).

Far Voice						KEY:Witch ~ Far Voice								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:The wind witch can send a message in song to anyone known to her within 10 miles per witch level × her Wisdom bonus.
