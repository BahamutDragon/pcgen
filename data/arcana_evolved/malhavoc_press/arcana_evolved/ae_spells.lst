###Block: Full Description
# Spell Name					Description
Ability Boost ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:Your touch carries with it a vigorous bit of violet energy. The subject gains a +2 enhancement bonus to the highest ability score that does not already have an enhancement bonus [if the subject has two ability scores which are the same, he can choose which gets boosted]. For example, if a character's highest ability score is Strength but he wears a belt of strength +4, this spell adds +2 to the next highest ability score [unless, of course, it also has an enhancement bonus]. Subjects who have enhancement bonuses on all their ability scores remain unaffected by this spell. If Intelligence is boosted, the character's skill points are not affected. If a spellcasting ability score [Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma] is boosted, the character does not gain bonus readied spells or spell slots. All other derived aspects of ability scores, such as hit points, attack and damage bonuses, AC bonuses, skill bonuses, spellcasting DCs, and so on, are modified. As with most spells, you gain no benefit from having this spell cast on you twice. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's range is Personal and target is You. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The enhancement bonus becomes +4.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Acrobatics ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You gain a +5 competence bonus to Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes +1. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes +10.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Aid Plants ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You stretch out your arms, and a warm glow spreads throughout the area. All nonintelligent and nonanimate plants in the area grow strengthened and able to resist disease. Casters use this spell mostly to aid crops, gardens, and forests. If a disease or other magical effect specifically targeted at plants threatens those aided by this spell, the plants get a Fortitude saving throw [even if one is not normally allowed]. The bonus is equal to the caster's Fortitude saving throw bonus. If the effect already allows for a saving throw, the plants use their own bonus or the caster's bonus, whichever is greater. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects one plant. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell can affect intelligent and animate plants.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Animate Weapon ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You direct the movement of one melee weapon with which you are proficient and could normally wield, making it fly through the air to any place within range that you can see. It moves and attacks as you would if you were wielding it. Thus, if you have a speed of 30 feet and an attack bonus of +10/+5, it could move up to 30 feet and make a single attack with a +10 bonus, or it could move 5 feet and make two attacks, one with a +10 bonus and the other with a +5 bonus. The weapon threatens areas and can flank foes, just as if it were in your hands. Reach weapons have reach. The weapon also can provoke attacks of opportunity as if it were a creature. The weapon can be targeted for attacks [AC usually based only on size], with hit points and hardness dependent upon the type. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The weapon can take only one action per round-either a standard or a move-equivalent action, but not both-and suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You may apply your Charisma, Wisdom, or Intelligence modifier [your choice] rather than your Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Animate the Dead ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:This spell turns the bones or body of a dead creature into an abominable, walking undead. Enough of the corpse must be present to make for a passable undead creature-a skeletal structure, a great deal of flesh from one creature, etc. Sickly greenish light flows over these remains, and the soul of the creature is restored into a rotting but now-animate corpse. Immediately, the creature must make a Will saving throw. If the save fails, the undead must obey your verbal commands. If successful, the creature remains in control of its own will. It can then attempt a second saving throw [if the DM deems that it would wish to]. If the second save succeeds, the soul returns to its normal afterlife, and the corpse crumbles to dust. The soul of a creature trapped in an undead body, if it was not twisted before, quickly becomes corrupt, bloodthirsty, and malevolent. An undead and uncontrolled creature attempts to slay its creator as quickly as it can. An undead creature has all the abilities it possessed in life, modified by the corporeal undead template [see Chapter Twelve: Creatures]. You can control only one undead creature at a time. Any attempt to animate a second undead while you have one under your control always frees the first one. The only exception to this are creatures whose truenames you knew when they were alive [they do not count against your total of one controllable undead at a time] or undead under the effects of a control undead spell. Creatures whose souls are not available cannot be animated as undead. Thus, even if a large portion of the body of a still-living [or once again living] creature is available, it cannot be animated. Likewise, those creatures with trapped or protected souls cannot be animated. This spell requires 500 gp worth of special oils to be sprinkled on the corpse. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The undead moves at only half its normal speed, gains no Dexterity bonus [see creature template], and can take only one action per round, either move-equivalent or standard, but not both. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The undead gains +1 hp per Hit Die, a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 enhancement bonus to attack rolls. Casting time becomes 1 round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Appropriate Size ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You ensorcel an object so that it becomes "appropriately sized" for whatever creature holds or wears it, up to size Huge and down to size Tiny creatures. For clothing and items that are worn, the "appropriate size" is fairly obvious. For weapons, the weapon becomes just big enough or just small enough to wield comfortably. For example, for a Medium human, a short sword, longsword, or greatsword do not change size under the effects of this spell. A Huge greatsword would shrink to the size of a normal greatsword, however. A Tiny longsword would remain dagger-sized for the human, but a Tiny short sword would grow to dagger size. Other objects change size only if it is impossible for the creature to use them properly unchanged. A Huge statue does not shrink [because a statue can be enjoyed at any size], but a very tiny book might grow large enough for a creature to read it without eyestrain. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell modifies objects for a creature of any size.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Arrow Reflection ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You can force one ranged physical [nonspell] attack back at its source each round as a free action in response to the attack. The attack retains its initial attack roll to determine whether it hits the source and inflicts damage normally. Thus, if an archer fires an arrow at you with an attack roll of 25, you reflect it back at the archer, striking if the archer's Armor Class is 25 or less. You must be aware of the attack, not flat footed, however. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The attack misses you but misses the attacker as well. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: If you hit, the attack's damage doubles.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Attack From Within ~ MP (Elemental).MOD	DESC:You summon an elemental force to appear within a creature or object. The element you choose at the time of casting [air, earth, fire, or water] determines the spell's descriptor. The target suffers 1d6 points of damage [of the appropriate elemental type] per caster level [maximum 10d6] as the air churns within it, the earth bursts out of it, the fire blazes deep inside it, or the water fills and expands it from within. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts a maximum of 5d6 points of damage, and a successful Fortitude save negates the attack. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The elemental conjuration extends out in a 5-foot-radius spread around the target. Anything or anyone within that area suffers half damage [Reflex saving throw negates].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Attack From Within ~ MP (Energy).MOD	DESC:You summon dangerous energy to appear within a creature or object. The energy type you choose at the time of casting [acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic] determines the spell's descriptor. The target suffers 1d6 points of damage [of the appropriate energy type] per caster level [maximum 15d6] as the energy bursts from within. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts a maximum of 10d6 points of damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The energy that bursts out of the victim extends out in a 10-footradius spread around the target. Anything or anyone within that area suffers half damage [Reflex saving throw negates].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bash ~ MP.MOD					DESC:Your eyes glow with silvery might until the spell ends. The next time you make a melee attack, add a +2 competence bonus to the attack and damage roll. Once used, the spell ends. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus is +5.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Battle Healing ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:As lesser battle healing, except that you cure 1d6 points of damage per caster level, up to a maximum of 15d6. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You heal 2d6 points of damage + 2 points per caster level [maximum +30 points]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You heal 6 points of damage per level [maximum 120 points].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Battle Healing ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:Laying your hand upon a living creature, you infuse the subject with positive [life] energy and cure 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [maximum +10 points]. As you do, your hands take on a light green glow. Your touch feels cool and soothing. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can attempt a Will saving throw to take half damage. Creatures healed with this spell often are left with scars appropriate to the amount of damage inflicted. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You heal 1 point of damage per level [maximum 5 points]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You heal 1d6 points of damage + 2 points per caster level [maximum +20 points].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Beastskin ~ MP (Lesser).MOD			DESC:The creature's skin becomes tough, and either scaly or leathery and somewhat furred [your choice]. Lesser beastskin grants a +2 natural armor bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases to +3 if you are 5th to 9th level and to +4 if you are 10th level and up. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes +1 to Armor Class regardless of caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 12 hours.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bind With Plants ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You transform a plant into a grasping trap that immediately wraps around a single creature, up to two sizes larger than you. The plant grows to conform to the size of the creature, which must be on the ground or within 5 feet of the plant. The plant holds the creature immobile and helpless. The creature remains aware and breathes normally but cannot take any physical actions, even speech. It can, however, execute purely mental actions [such as casting a spell with only mental components]. Others can attempt to break the creature free, but this requires a Strength check [DC 28]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The creature can break free on its own with a Strength check [DC 22]. The Strength check for others to free him becomes only DC 18. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell causes a plant to grow up under the target and grasp, allowing a character to cast it anywhere.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Blast of Castigation ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You hurl a ray of violet energy from your open palm. You must make a ranged touch attack roll against the target, which must be a creature. A successful strike inflicts 1d8 points of damage per three caster levels [maximum 5d8]. You may then concentrate to continue blasting the target with a continuous beam of energy. Each round that you blast the target, the spell deals 1d8 points of damage per three caster levels [maximum 5d8]. If you or the target moves so as to break the line of effect, even for a moment, the spell ends. You cannot switch the target of the spell, once cast. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration of the spell becomes instantaneous [there is no continuing blast effect]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The ray inflicts 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 10d8].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Blinding Light ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You blast intense light from your fist. The target is blinded for 1 round/level. Creatures without eyes are immune to this spell. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell requires you to make a ranged touch attack, and the foe still gets a saving throw. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can blast up to one extra target every three levels, as long as no two are more than 20 feet apart.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Blooded Athame ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You give your athame the wounding quality as described in Chapter Seven: Magic Items of the DMG, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage with each strike. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The weapon's wounding ability has only a 50 percent chance of working with each strike. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The weapon's wounding ability inflicts 2 points of temporary Constitution damage with each strike.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Boil ~ MP.MOD					DESC:This spell causes the water in the area to become very hot. Any creature at least 25 percent submerged in water in the area suffers 1d6 points of damage [half fire damage and half water damage] per caster level [maximum 5d6]. Water in the area fills with bubbles and provides 50 percent concealment. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects the water around one submerged creature in range. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell boils the water within living creatures with any water content [DM's discretion], even if they are not in water. Creatures in the area suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d6]. Creatures submerged in water suffer an additional +1d6 points of damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bolt of Power ~ MP.MOD				DESC:From your clenched fist you emit a blast of pure magical force that inflicts 2d6 points of damage per caster level. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Call Radont ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You call a wild radont [see Chapter Twelve: Creatures] that is predisposed to like you. If you know the radont's truename, it obeys your every command for the duration. Otherwise, it acts friendly to you, although not controlled. A friendly radont will allow you to ride it, it will fight for you [although it will not sacrifice its life for you], it will carry a heavy load for you, or it will carry a message for you. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell calls a domesticated radont. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell calls 1d3 wild radonts.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bypass Ward ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The area briefly glows with a moving wave of golden light. You suppress all magical traps and sealing or warding spells [like elemental trap or lesser [but not greater] sealed door] in the area for the duration, if you make a caster power check [DC 15 + the trap's CR or the spell's level]. You can also suppress touch-trigger runes in the area with a caster power check; the DC is the same as it would be to identify them [see the runethane in Chapter Three]. You do not need to be aware of a trap or ward to suppress it. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You can suppress only one trap, and you must be aware of it. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell suppresses [disables] mechanical traps too, with a successful caster power check [DC 10 + the trap's CR]. The disabled traps resume function when the duration ends.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Canny Effort ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Your eyes flash with a tiny sparkle until the spell ends. The next time you make a skill check of any kind, you get to add a +2 competence bonus to the roll. Once used, the spell ends. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus is +10.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Carnivorous Plant Defense ~ MP.MOD		DESC:You transform an innocuous plant into an animate, carnivorous one that defends you. It wraps around you with leafy vines and grows one mouthlike structure for every three caster levels you have [maximum five]. When a foe attacks you in melee combat, the plant immediately retaliates with a bite that uses your base attack bonus [plus the plant's Strength bonus of +3] and inflicts 1d6+3 points of damage. The plant strikes only in retaliation and does so automatically [you cannot command it to stop]. Each mouthlike structure can strike only once per round. The plant does not make attacks of opportunity and cannot take special attack actions such as grapple or disarm. The plant has 10 hp + 1/caster level and shares your Armor Class and saving throws. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell forms only one mouthlike structure, with a maximum attack bonus of +10. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The mouths each inflict 2d6+6 points of damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Chains of Vengeance ~ MP.MOD			DESC:Chains of fire wrap around the target, rendering her helpless and dealing her 2d6 points of fire damage each round. The target may attempt to break free with a Strength check [DC 25] or Escape Artist check [DC 30]. These attempts, however, automatically inflict an additional 2d6 points of fire damage upon her. Others may try to help [see the "aid another" rules in Chapter Seven: Playing the Game], or they can attempt to break her free on their own [Strength check, DC 25], but those who try suffer 1d6 points of fire damage. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The target's Strength check becomes DC 18 and the Escape Artist check DC 23. The flames inflict 1d6 points of fire damage per round. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell can affect Huge creatures.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Charm ~ MP.MOD					DESC:This spell alters someone's mind temporarily to make you seem like a most charming being. You gain a +10 bonus to Charisma-related checks [including Intimidate] regarding that target only. This does not actually change your Charisma- you do not, for example, gain bonus spells if you are a mage blade. The spell works on creatures of the same type as you. So if you are a litorian, the spell works on all humanoids. If you are a medusa, it works on all monstrous humanoids. DMs should require charmed PCs to act accordingly. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell adds only a +4 bonus to Charisma-related checks and lasts only 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell affects any living creature.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Clairaudience/Clairvoyance ~ MP.MOD		DESC:Clairaudience/clairvoyance enables you to concentrate upon some locale and hear or see [your choice] almost as if you were there. Distance is not a factor, but the locale must be known-a place familiar to you or an obvious one, such as the other side of a door you're looking at. The spell does not allow magically enhanced senses to work through it: If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks the spell, and you sense that the spell is so blocked. The spell creates an invisible sensor that can be dispelled. The spell functions only on the plane of existence you currently occupy. Once the spell is cast, the sensor cannot move. Only you can see through the sensor [you see the images or hear the sounds in your mind]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Distance becomes a factor: You cannot see a location farther away than 10 feet per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell lets magically enhanced senses work through it.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Clinging Shadows ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You launch a seething bolt of pure shadow at a single target that inflicts 2d6 points of impact damage. Further, a struck foe is entangled by the shadowstuff, which clings to its body. The shadowstuff cannot be broken or slipped out of, but it can be dispelled. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to its effective Dexterity score. An entangled creature attempting to cast a spell must make a Concentration check [DC 15 + the spell's level] or lose the spell. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts no damage, but only entangles. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The shadows cling to the ground or other nearby solid surface [if any], holding the target in place [the creature can take actions but cannot move from its current position].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Cloak of Darkness ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You create an area of magical darkness around you. All attacks against you have a 20 percent miss chance. Although you can see normally, you appear to be simply an ominous, cloak-shaped area of darkness, which grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Intimidate checks [but the character you are trying to Intimidate cannot see you, which may negate other possible modifiers]. When in areas of shadow or darkness, or even a dimly lit area, you gain a +5 circumstance bonus to Sneak checks when opposing Spot checks but not Listen checks. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one minute per level, and the bonus to Sneak checks is only +2. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can cloak all within 5 feet of you, as long as they remain that close.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Cold Blast ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You launch a blast of white energy from your eyes. You must make a ranged touch attack. Targets suffer 1d4 points of cold damage + 1 point of temporary Strength damage + 1 point of Strength damage per five caster levels. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The subjects suffer only 1d4 points of damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The subjects are stunned for a round as well.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Compelling Command ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You give a creature one of three commands, which it obeys to the best of its ability. The three possible commands are as follows: Drop what you are holding: The target drops whatever it is holding-even if it holds different objects in different hands-on its next action. Fall to the ground: The target falls prone on its next action and remains on the ground for 1 round. Flee before me: The target runs away from you as fast as possible for 1 round [the target won't run into obvious danger, like a pit or through an enemy's threatened area]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must know the creature's truename in order for the spell to work. In this case, the spell takes on the truename descriptor. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell is entirely mental-no common language need be shared, and nothing is spoken aloud. In this case, the spell takes on the psionic descriptor.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Compelling Question ~ MP (Lesser).MOD	DESC:You ask another creature one simple question that it can answer with a single word. On the target's next turn, as a free action, it answers you as truthfully as possible. The DM is free to assign modifiers to the saving throw based on how important the target considers the answer. Asking someone whether she is the king's murderer, for example, involves a closely guarded secret and may earn a trained assassin a +4 competence bonus to the save. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must know the creature's truename in order for the spell to work. In this case, the spell takes on the truename descriptor. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell is entirely mental-no common language need be shared, and nothing is spoken aloud. In this case, the spell takes on the psionic descriptor and is often called lesser mind probe.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Compelling Question ~ MP (Greater).MOD	DESC:As lesser compelling question, except that the answer may require up to 25 words. Answering the question remains a free action, and the details of the answer still modify the saving throw. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must know the creature's truename in order for the spell to work. In this case, the spell takes on the truename descriptor. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell is entirely mental-no common language need be shared, and nothing is spoken aloud. In this case, the spell takes on the psionic descriptor and is often called greater mind probe.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Energy Creature I ~ MP.MOD		DESC:With a flash of power, this spell creates a monster out of pure energy. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. If you do not give it a command, it attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. You can communicate with it and can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. Conjured creatures act normally on the last round of the spell and disappear at the end of their turn. You choose the creature's energy type [acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic]. The spell takes on the descriptor of the energy type chosen. The monster, although energy, is nevertheless corporeal and solid. It uses the statistics of a monster of your choice from the list below, except for the following: It is immune to damage of its energy type. If it has more than 3 HD, it has DR 5/+1 [or 5/magic]. If it has more than 10 HD, it has DR 10/+2 [or 10/magic]. It has no Intelligence score or Constitution score. [If it has no opponents to attack and no commands to follow, it stands motionless.] It is a construct [immune to mind effects, poison, paralysis, stunning, disease, and necromantic effects]. It is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. It is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save. It is not subject to death by massive damage. It is destroyed [and disappears] when it reaches 0 hit points. It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet. It inflicts additional damage of its energy type equal to its Hit Dice [maximum +10] with each attack. Choose the type of creature you want the spell to conjure from this list: dire rat, dog [animal], hawk [animal], or monkey [animal]. The creature is not real. It is a creation of magic. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must concentrate on the creature's actions or it remains motionless. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The created creature enjoys +1 hp per Hit Die, a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Energy Creature II ~ MP.MOD		DESC:As conjure energy creature I, except you may pick from this list of creatures: eagle [animal], Medium shark [animal], octopus [animal], Tiny viper [animal], or wolf [animal]. Alternatively, you can create 1d3 creatures from the 1st-level list. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must concentrate on the created creature's actions or it remains motionless. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The created creature enjoys +1 hp per Hit Die, a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Energy Creature III ~ MP.MOD	DESC:As conjure energy creature I, except you may pick from this list of creatures: black bear [animal], constrictor snake [animal], crocodile [animal], dire bat, giant lizard [animal], gorilla [animal], Large shark [animal], leopard [animal], or Small viper [animal]. Alternatively, you can create 1d3 creatures from the 2nd-level list. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must concentrate on the created creature's actions or it remains motionless. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The created creature enjoys +1 hp per Hit Die, a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Energy Creature IV ~ MP.MOD		DESC:As conjure energy creature I, except you may pick from this list of creatures: ankheg, dire ape, dire wolf, giant eagle, hell hound, lion [animal], or Medium viper [animal]. Alternatively, you can create 1d3 creatures from the 3rd-level list. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must concentrate on the created creature's actions or it remains motionless. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The created creature enjoys +1 hp per Hit Die, a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Energy Creature V ~ MP.MOD		DESC:As conjure energy creature I, except you may pick from this list of creatures: brown bear [animal], dire lion, dire wolverine, giant constrictor snake [animal], giant crocodile [animal], girallon, griffon, Huge shark [animal], Large viper [animal], orca, pegasus, tiger [animal], or whale [animal].

HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The created creature enjoys +1 hp per Hit Die, a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Repast ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell creates simple fare of your choice. The food decays at a normal rate. The created water is just like clean rainwater. It doesn't go bad as the food does. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell creates enough food for only one human. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell creates a sumptuous, delicious feast for up to 10 humans or three horses per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Weapon ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:As lesser conjure weapon, except that the weapon has an enhancement bonus of +1, plus +1 per five caster levels. At no cost, the weapon can be given an elemental or energy template, in which case it inflicts +1d6 points of damage and the spell gains the appropriate descriptor. Further, if you have the appropriate feats enabling you to wield such weapons, the weapon you create can have the dire or Devanian template. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration of the spell becomes 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration of the spell becomes 10 minutes per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Conjure Weapon ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:You create a masterwork weapon that you are proficient with, which appears in your hand. The weapon is appropriate for your size-either as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for you. If it is a ranged weapon that requires ammunition, you also create one arrow, bolt, or bullet [as appropriate] per level. If given the earth spell template, the weapon [or the ammunition in the case of ranged weapons requiring them] gains an additional +1 attack and damage bonus, due to its elemental hardness. You may give the weapon to someone else to wield or cast animate weapon on it. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must concentrate each round or the weapon disappears. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: At no cost, the weapon can be given an elemental or energy template, in which case it inflicts +1d6 and the spell gains the appropriate descriptor. Further, if you have the appropriate feats enabling you to wield such weapons, the weapon you create can have the dire or Devanian template.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Contact ~ MP.MOD					DESC:Using this minor spell allows you to send a mental message, up to one word per caster level, to a creature you touch. You do not get a message back, but you do get an idea of the subject's emotional state. Contact does not reveal magical charms or compulsions on the subject. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The subject can send a mental message back, up to one word per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Control Temperature ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You can raise or lower the temperature in the area around you by 10 degrees F per caster level, to a maximum of 110 degrees F and a minimum of 0 degrees. Temperatures already above or below this range cannot be affected. When the temperature begins to change, it does so in 10-degree increments per round, until it reaches the desired temperature. You can readjust the temperature as many times as you want while the duration lasts. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The temperature rises or falls up to 20 degrees maximum. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The caster can affect temperatures above or below the range of 0 to 110 degrees F, but still cannot take a temperature within the range and raise or lower it out of that range.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Control Undead ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You control the actions of an undead creature. If you share a common language, you can force the undead to perform as you desire, within the limits of your abilities. If you share no common language, you can communicate only basic commands, such as, "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You gain no special knowledge of what the undead is experiencing, nor do you receive direct sensory input from it. You need to see the undead to control it; if either of you move out of range, the control breaks. A magic circle or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of control, nor does it dispel it. If the subject of this spell is an undead creature that you animated, roused, or otherwise created, the duration becomes 10 minutes per level rather than 1 round per level. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's range becomes Touch, so the caster must remain touching the creature for the duration. The undead obeys only basic commands [as described above], regardless of language. The undead must have fewer Hit Dice than the caster. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The caster need not be within sight of the undead and intuitively knows what the undead is experiencing. Once control is established, the caster need not remain within range.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Creation ~ MP (Greater).MOD			DESC:You create a permanent, nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level, and its overall value cannot exceed more than 50 gp per caster level. You must succeed at an appropriate Craft skill check to make a complex item, such as a crossbow or an hourglass. Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The item's value cannot exceed 5 gp per caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell can create multiple items, up to one per caster level, each no larger than 1 cubic foot per caster level and each worth no more than 10 gp per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Creation ~ MP (Lesser).MOD			DESC:You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed at an appropriate Craft skill check to make a complex item, such as a longbow, which is made out of different materials. Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration lasts only one minute per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The object need not be of vegetable matter, but can be of any nonmagical matter. However, the item's value cannot exceed more than 5 gp per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Creature Loresight ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You learn something significant about a creature [living or dead] that you touch. Go through this list, in order-the first bit of lore you don't know, you learn magically: 1. Creature's race or type. 2. Creature's name [if none, then skip]. 3. Creature's class [if none, then skip]. 4. How the creature died [if not applicable, skip]. 5. Creature's most recent, basic goal [obtain food, carry out the orders of its superior, get some sleep, etc.]. 6. Creature's attitude toward you. 7. Creature that this creature interacted with most recently [other than you]. 8. Creature's most valuable possession, if any. 9. Location of the creature's home or lair, if any. 10. Creature's current thoughts. Multiple castings allow you to gain multiple bits of information. If you know all of the above information, this spell teaches you nothing. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Spell gains a range of Close [50 feet + 5 feet/two levels].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Curse of Vengeance ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You utter the truename of a chosen foe, and that foe is followed forevermore by bad luck and misery. The target suffers a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks. Further, once per day, at a random time the DM chooses, the target suffers a -10 additional circumstance penalty on one important attack roll, saving throw, or check. Because this is a curse, it cannot be dispelled. Remove curse is the only means to remedy it. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The target does not suffer the random -10 penalty. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The target suffers a -4 morale penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks, and the random penalty becomes -20.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Dancing Rune ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You make one touch-trigger rune that you have inscribed with the password quality rise up to dance in the air as a glowing symbol made of energy. It orbits around you for the duration [or until triggered]. The rune never moves beyond 3 feet from you, but it moves as you direct it, striking at foes adjacent to you with a melee touch attack that uses your base attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier as its attack bonus. Directing such an attack is a standard action. Once triggered, the dancing rune disappears. You cannot make runes created by others dance. You cannot have more than one dancing rune in effect at a time. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: This spell affects only minor or lesser runes. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can have up to one dancing rune per four caster levels in effect, if they are all heightened.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Darkvision ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The subject gains the ability to see 60 feet even in total darkness. Darkvision is black and white only, but otherwise like normal sight. Darkvision does not grant one the ability to see in magical darkness. The subject's eyes become all white for the duration. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Subject gains low-light vision. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Subject can see 5 feet in magical darkness in addition to normal effects.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Defensive Field ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You create a silver-blue energy field around yourself that can sustain 5 points of damage per caster level. Subtract all incoming damage [hit point damage- normal or subdual-but not ability score damage] from the field before any of it reaches you; as long as the field has any hit points left, it absorbs the entire attack. Thus, if a 9th-level caster casts defensive field upon himself, the field has 45 hp. If someone strikes the caster with a sword for 13 points of damage, the field has 32 hp left. If the caster then falls into a pit and suffers 20 points of damage, he takes no damage himself and the field retains 10 hp. If the unlucky caster then finds himself in the area of a sorcerous blast which inflicts 24 points of damage, the field is destroyed, but he emerges unscathed. The field also blocks any effect accompanying an attack that requires damage to be inflicted, such as a poisonous bite or the effects of an axe of wounding. Damage from artifacts, spells of 7th level or above, and +5 weapons bypass the field. The field does not protect against nondamaging attacks like wind churn, gaze attacks, or disintegration [although it would absorb the damage inflicted by a disintegration spell if the subject's save succeeds]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The field sustains only 3 hit points per caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The field regenerates 1 hit point per round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Destructive Grip ~ MP.MOD			DESC:Your hand oozes a powerful acid. Your touch inflicts 1d6 points of acid damage. Since the duration is 1 round/level, you can make multiple touch attacks with this spell. If you are grappling, your foe automatically takes 1d6 points of acid damage per round, regardless of what actions you attempt. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point per caster level, but it only works on a single touch. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Destructive grip inflicts 2d6 points of damage per touch.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Detect Creature ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You can detect the aura that surrounds a given type of creature. You must specify the type of creature being sought [giants, humanoids, dragons, and so on] when you cast the spell. Once chosen, you cannot change the type unless you cast the spell again. You cannot choose a specific creature [you can select humanoids, but not Grak the goblin]. The amount of information the spell reveals depends on how long you study a particular area or subject: 1st Round: Presence or absence of the specified creature. 2nd Round: Number of specified creatures in the area and the strength of the strongest one present. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each creature. If a creature is outside your line of sight, you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Strength: The creature's Hit Dice determine the strength of its aura. Each round you can detect creatures in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: All information comes in the first round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Detect Disease ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You can determine whether a creature, object, or area is diseased or carries a disease. You can tell the exact type of disease with a successful Wisdom check [DC 20]. If you have the Heal skill, you may try a Heal check [DC 20] if the Wisdom check fails, or you may try the Heal check prior to the Wisdom check. Detect disease can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Detect Magic ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You can detect magical auras. The amount of information the spell reveals depends on how long you study a particular area or subject: 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the strength of the strongest one. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. [Make one check per aura, DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.] Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's magical power and strength depend on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength. Note: Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are conjured, the conjuration spell registers. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: All information comes in the first round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Detect Poison ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You can determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. With a successful Wisdom check [DC 20], you can determine the exact type of poison. If you have the Alchemy skill, you may try an Alchemy check [DC 20] if the Wisdom check fails, or you may try the Alchemy check prior to the Wisdom check. This spell penetrates barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Detect Secret Doors ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. This spell discerns only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection. The amount of information detect secret doors reveals depends on how long you study a particular area: 1st Round: Presence or absence of secret doors. 2nd Round: Number of secret doors and the location of each one. If an aura is outside your line of sight, you discern its direction but not its exact location. Each Additional Round: The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal that you closely examine. Note: Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: All information comes in the first round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Dimensional Door ~ MP.MOD			DESC:The subjects instantly transfer from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired-whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, subjects can't take any other actions until their next turn. If the subjects arrive in a place already occupied by a solid body, they become trapped in the invisible and intangible magical conduits that permit such travel. Each round the subjects remain trapped in this way, you must make a caster power check [DC 25] to escape to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, make a caster power check [DC 25] each minute to appear in a free space within 1,000 feet. If there's no free space within 1,000 feet, the subjects are stuck until rescued. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Range becomes Close [25 feet + 5 feet/two levels], and the destination must be within your sight when you cast the spell. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The range and weight limits double.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Directed Charm ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell alters someone's mind temporarily to make a single creature you choose seem like a most charming being. You cannot choose yourself-you must direct the target's attraction to someone else. The creature you choose gains a +10 bonus to Charisma-related checks regarding the spell's target. This effect does not actually change the creature's Charisma, however. The spell works on creatures of the same type as you. So if you are a litorian, the spell works on all humanoids. If you are a medusa, it works on all monstrous humanoids. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell adds only an effective +4 bonus. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell affects any living creature.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Disorient ~ MP.MOD				DESC:A creature you touch with your blueglowing hand becomes disoriented. The target immediately rerolls its initiative. Until its next action, it is considered flat footed. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The target also suffers a -1 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and checks for 1d4 rounds.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Dispel Magic ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells [or at least their effects] within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel magic. This spell can dispel [but not counter] the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells. Dispel magic affects spell-like effects just as it affects spells. Note: The effects of spells with Instantaneous durations can't be dispelled, because the magical effect has already ended before dispel magic can take effect. You must choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the spell. Make a caster power check against the target spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target object or creature [DC 15 + the spell's caster level]. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell [such as a monster summoned by conjure energy creature], an opposed caster power check ends the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object you target is a magic item, make a caster power check [DC 15 + the item's caster level]. If you succeed, you suppress all the item's magical properties for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An inter-dimensional interface is temporarily closed. Remember that a magic item's physical properties go unchanged. Artifacts and creatures of demigod or higher status remain unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed at the dispel check against any spell that you cast. Area Dispel: The spell affects everything within a 30-foot radius. For each creature in the area that is the target of one or more spells, make a caster power check [DC 15 + the spell's caster level] against the spell with the highest caster level. If that fails, make checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell [which discharges the dispel so far as that target is concerned] or fail all your checks for that creature. The creature's magic items are not affected. For each object that is the target of one or more spells, make caster power checks as with creatures. Magic items go unaffected by area dispels. You may make a caster power check to dispel each ongoing area or effect spell centered within dispel magic's area. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the area dispel, make a caster power check to end the effect, but only within the area of dispel magic. If you target an area containing an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell [such as a monster summoned by conjure energy creature], make a caster power check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature [returning it whence it came], in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting that creature or object. You may choose to succeed automatically at dispel checks against any spell that you cast. Counterspell: The spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. [Refer to the Brandish Magical Might feat.] You must make an opposed caster power check to counter the other spellcaster's spell. This spell cannot dispel curses. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Range becomes Touch, and only targeted dispels are possible. You make caster power checks at a -5 penalty. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: When casting an area dispel, you can specifically state spell effects that you do not want to dispel. You must be aware of the effects to choose this option.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Distraction ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You create a mental image in someone's mind of something the target will find distracting-because it is either annoying, alluring, or frightening. The target, not the caster, decides what form the phantasm takes. A failed save means the target takes no effective action for 1 round other than to defend herself. Instead, she interacts with the image in her mind-swatting at an imaginary fly, dodging an imaginary attack, staring in surprise at an imaginary loved one, and so on. A new saving throw is allowed each round, and once the target makes a successful save, the spell ends. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell lasts 1 round. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Once the target fails the first save, she cannot act effectively for the duration.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Dominate ~ MP (Lesser).MOD			DESC:You can control the actions of any humanoid of Medium or smaller size whose truename you know. [If you are not a humanoid, you can also dominate creatures of your type.] You establish a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If you share a common language, you generally can force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of his abilities. Without a common language, you can communicate only basic commands, such as, "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing but receive no direct sensory input from him. Subjects resist this control, and those forced to take actions against their natures receive a new saving throw with a bonus of +1 to +4, depending on the type of action required. Obviously subjects do not carry out self-destructive orders. Once control is established, you can exercise it at any range, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control him. Magic circle or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not stop you from establishing lesser dominate, nor does it dispel it. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The range becomes Touch, and the duration becomes one minute per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell affects up to size Medium creatures with fewer Hit Dice than you and lasts one day per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Door Warning ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You cast this spell on a door. The next time that door is opened, you become aware of it, and you know the name of the one who opened it. If a creature without a name opened the door-or a natural force, like the wind-you learn the kind of creature or force it is. Once the door opens, the spell ends. You may have only one such spell active at any given time. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You may have two door warnings active at one time.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Drain Away Speed ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:As lesser drain away speed, except the spell affects any creature and reduces speed by 40 feet. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The target's speed is reduced by 20 feet. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: A subject whose speed falls to 0 or below becomes truly motionless. He cannot take actions and becomes helpless.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Drain Away Speed ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:This spell surrounds the target in a brief nimbus of blurred, swirling shapes, then reduces its speed by 30 feet. If a target's speed falls to 0 or below, it is rooted to the spot and cannot take move actions. Actions that do not involve moving from the rooted spot, such as making melee attacks at nearby foes, casting spells, using ranged weapons, and so on, are not hampered. Gravity continues to affect flying creatures in the air, but since they are not motionless, they can make a controlled [nondamaging] fall straight down. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: A subject whose speed falls to 0 or below becomes truly motionless. He cannot take actions and becomes helpless.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Earth Burst ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You transform a rock weighing between 1 and 5 lbs. into a dangerous weapon. Upon command, or when the spell's duration ends, the stone bursts, spraying bits of rock in a 20-foot radius. Anyone in the radius takes 1d6 points of earth damage per caster level [5d6 maximum]. Once you've cast the spell, you can throw the rock, drop it, place it where you wish and run, load it into a catapult, and so on. Throwing the stone requires a Large sling. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The burst inflicts 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels [5d4 maximum]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The burst also creates a thunderous noise, deafening anyone in the area who fails the save. The spell then takes on the sonic descriptor.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Earth's Clutches ~ MP.MOD			DESC:Your touch causes a creature standing on earthen or rocky ground to be gripped by stony hands that come out of the earth. The creature is held in place until the hands suffer any damage [they have hardness 8] or the creature makes a Strength check [DC 15]. Casting this spell multiple times on a single target does not alter the effects. A caster using the earth template with this spell adds a +6 bonus to the hardness and requires the hands to suffer 3 points of damage before releasing the target. The template adds a +6 bonus to the Strength check's Difficulty Class as well. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The hands are brittle, with a hardness of only 3. The trapped creature need only make a Strength check [DC 12] to escape. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The hands are stronger than normal and have hardness 10. The Strength check Difficulty Class is 18.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Eldritch Wall ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:As lesser eldritch wall, except for the wall's size and the fact that it can absorb up to 100 points of damage per caster level before being destroyed. Disintegration immediately destroys it. You can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane with an area of up to one 10-foot square per level, or into a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 1 foot per level. If you're trying to trap a creature within the hemisphere, it may attempt a Reflex save to move. The eldritch wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If any object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails. If a creature to be trapped in the hemisphere version of the spell makes a successful save, its movement breaks the surface and the spell fails. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The wall absorbs only 25 hit points per caster level before it is destroyed. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The wall inflicts 2d6 points of electricity damage to anyone that touches it [giving it the electricity descriptor as well].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Eldritch Wall ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:You create an invisible wall of magical force. The wall cannot move. It has no hardness but can absorb up to 10 points of damage per caster level before being destroyed. Disintegration immediately destroys it. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although teleportation spells and effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks incorporeal creatures as well as material creatures [though incorporeal creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings]. Gaze attacks can operate through the wall. The eldritch wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If any object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The wall lasts only 1 round per level and absorbs only 5 hit points per caster level before it is destroyed. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The wall inflicts 1d6 points of electricity damage to anyone that touches it [giving it the electricity descriptor as well].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Eldritch Web ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You create a many-layered mesh of bluish energy beams that resemble the strands of a spider's web. Alternately, you create a two-dimensional barrier of energy webs. These strands trap those caught within them. The strands magically cling to anything they touch and are very strong. You must anchor the eldritch web to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points, or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears with a flash of light. Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become entangled. An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls, suffers a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can't move. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check [DC 15] or lose the spell. Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. On a success, the creature is not stuck in the eldritch web and remains free to act. He also can freely move out of the area of the webs. If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding at a Strength check [DC 20] or an Escape Artist check [DC 25]. Once loose, a creature may progress through the web very slowly. Each round devoted entirely to moving allows the creature to move 5 feet + 1 foot for each point of Strength above 10. If the barrier version is used, those escaping or breaking free are completely free. Those wishing to pass through the barrier must make the same checks to get through. The eldritch web cannot be physically destroyed, although it can be dispelled, and disintegration brings it down immediately. The eldritch web provides one-quarter cover for every 5 feet of web between the character and a foe. It offers one-half cover for every 10 feet of web, three-quarters cover for 15 feet, and total cover for 20 feet or more. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The effect becomes a 5-foot spread. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The energy strands inflict 1d4 points of electricity damage per round to anyone touching them [giving this spell the electricity descriptor as well].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Elemental Trap ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Elemental trap creates an explosion of fire, wind, water, or stony projectiles when an intruder opens the item that the spell wards. The elemental trap can ward any closeable item. When casting elemental trap, select a point on the item as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the item, an explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The elemental blast deals 5d6 points of elemental damage +1 point per caster level [maximum +20]. The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion. The trapped item cannot have a second warding spell on it. An unsuccessful dispel magic attempt does not detonate the spell. As the caster, you can use the trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the spell was specifically attuned when cast. "Attuning" to an individual usually involves a password that you can share with friends. The spell takes on the descriptor of whatever elemental type you choose. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration of the spell becomes one day per level, maximum. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The warding becomes devilishly tricky to remove, requiring two successful Disable Device checks, or two caster power checks, if using a bypass ward spell.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Enchanting Flavor ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You give an intense and pleasant flavor to a single meal for up to four people. Once they have finished eating the satisfying meal, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus on a single Charisma-based check [Diplomacy, Bluff, etc.] against the diners. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You transfer the flavor directly into the mouth of your targets; the target becomes 1d4 creatures, and the range becomes Close [25 feet + 5 feet/two levels]. You gain the +2 bonus immediately.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Energy Blade ~ MP.MOD				DESC:A 3-foot-long beam of energy springs from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a one-handed bladed weapon for you, threatening on a 19-20. Attacks with the energy blade are melee touch attacks, and you are considered proficient with the weapon. The blade deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels [maximum +10]. Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage, which is all energy damage. You choose the energy type [acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic]. Since this is energy damage, it ignores damage reduction. The spell gains the descriptor of the energy type chosen. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The blade inflicts 1d6 points of energy damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The blade inflicts 1d10 points of energy damage +1 point per two caster levels [maximum +15] + your spellcasting key ability score bonus.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Enfeebled Mind ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The target's Intelligence score drops to 1 and its eyes turn completely black [this does not alter its vision]. Still, the target knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. This temporary damage cannot be restored by restoration or healed normally until remove curse is first cast. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d6 points of temporary Intelligence damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The target affected also suffers a -5 competence penalty to Will saving throws [making the creature easily dominated, for example].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Enhance Magical Flow ~ MP (Greater).MOD	DESC:As lesser enhance magical flow, but the Difficulty Class increases by a +2 bonus. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus to the Difficulty Class becomes +4, but it applies only to the next spell you cast during the duration. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: In addition to the Difficulty Class increase, all spells you cast for the duration are treated as if you were two levels higher than your actual caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Enhance Magical Flow ~ MP (Lesser).MOD	DESC:Your hands and eyes flare briefly with golden power each time you cast a spell during the duration. All the saving throw Difficulty Classes for your spells gain a +1 enhancement bonus. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus to the Difficulty Class becomes +2, but it applies only to the next spell you cast during the duration. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: In addition to the Difficulty Class increase, all spells you cast for the duration are treated as if you were one level higher than your actual caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Enhance Witchery ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You infuse a witch [a creature able to use witchery powers] with energy. The effect of the spell depends on the nature of the ability it is used with. 1. If the ability can be used once per day, such as hail of metal, this spell allows a single additional use. 2. If the ability can be used multiple times per day [but still a limited number of times], such as icefire, the spell allows 1d4+1 additional uses. 3. If the ability has a constant or ongoing effect, or no limit to its uses, such as nature's warding word, the witch uses the ability as if he or she were two levels higher than actual level, or enough levels higher as to improve the witchery ability, whichever increase is smaller. For example, a 5th-level wind witch would need to gain three levels to increase the deflection bonus from a wind blade. Any additional use must take effect within the spell's duration, and any increase in effect due to virtual level increase [as described in option 3] lasts only as long as the spell's duration. For example, an Armor Class bonus increase from the spell affecting armor song ends when the spell ends, but the armor gained from armor song remains at its normal Armor Class bonus. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's range is Personal and the target is You. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: In effect 1, the spell grants two additional uses; in 2, the spell allows 1d6+2 additional uses; and in 3, the spell increases the effective witch level in the ability by five levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Familiarity of Place ~ MP (Lesser).MOD	DESC:With a ripple of energy emanating from you, you tie yourself directly [metaphysically speaking] to the place in which you currently stand. While in that area, you gain a +1 luck bonus to saving throws you make. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 1 round/level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus to saving throws becomes +2.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Fireburst ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a simple gesture, you send a burst of fire out from an already burning flame [even a candle] within range. The fireburst inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + 1d6 points per two caster levels [maximum 5d6]. The burst is too quick to ignite flammable items [like cloth or paper] but it can still ignite combustibles [like oil]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d4 points of damage rather than 1d6 points, and it does not increase with level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The burst continues to blast the area for 1d4 rounds, inflicting its damage on all in the area each round. Flammable objects will catch fire in the area. Since the duration becomes 1d4 rounds, heightened fireburst can be dispelled.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Flight ~ MP.MOD					DESC:The spell's subject can fly at its normal ground speed or 30 feet [whichever is slower]. The subject can fly up at half speed and descend at double speed. The flier's maneuverability rating is good. Using flight requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of flight can charge but not run. It cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. Should the duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the flier drops to the ground immediately. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also falls in this way if the flight spell is dispelled. Casting this spell on a subject that can already fly increases its maneuverability to perfect and adds 30 feet to its flying speed. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell does not confer flight but does increase the speed of a creature already flying [naturally or magically] by 20 feet. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell grants a speed of 60 feet regardless of ground speed.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Focused Power ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You call upon the ambient magic around you and focus it within yourself. You gain a +5 bonus to caster power checks. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects only one caster power check made during the duration. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus to caster power checks is +5, plus a +1 bonus per three caster levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Gaze of Terror ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell gives you a gaze attack that strikes fear into the hearts of all who meet your eye. Those affected become panicked; suffer a -2 morale penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and checks; have a 50 percent chance to drop whatever they are holding; and flee away from you as fast as they can for the spell's remaining duration. Each creature within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of its turn. An opponent can avert his eyes from your face, looking at your body, watching your shadow, or tracking you in a reflective surface. Each round, such an opponent has a 50 percent chance of not having to make a saving throw. You gain one-half concealment against the opponent [so any attack he makes against you has a 20 percent miss chance]. An opponent can shut his eyes, turn his back on you, or wear a blindfold. In these cases, the opponent does not need to make a saving throw. You gain total concealment against the opponent as if you were invisible. Thus, any attack the opponent makes against you has a 50 percent miss chance, and he can't use sight to target attacks. You can actively attempt to use the gaze of terror as an attack action. You simply choose a target within range, and that opponent must attempt a saving throw. If the target has chosen to defend against the gaze as discussed above, the opponent gets a chance to avoid the saving throw [either 50 percent chance for averting his eyes or 100 percent chance for shutting his eyes]. An opponent might have to save against your gaze twice during the same round: once before his own action and once during your action. Looking at your own image [such as in a mirror or as part of an illusion] does not subject you to the fear effect. You are immune to your own gaze attack. If visibility is so limited [by dim lighting, fog, etc.] as to result in concealment, there is a percentage chance that an opponent won't need to make a saving throw in a given round. This chance is equal to the normal miss chance for the amount of concealment present. This chance is not cumulative with chances to avoid the gaze, but instead one rolls it separately. You cannot use your gaze attack while you are invisible. Characters using darkvision in complete darkness are affected by a gaze attack normally. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell grants the gaze attack for only 1 round and can affect only one creature [once a creature is affected, the gaze attack fades]. The affected creature flees for 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Even targets who make their saves [except those immune to fear effects] are shaken and suffer a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Gentle Repose ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You preserve the remains of a dead creature so they do not decay. Doing so extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead: Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. The spell also works on severed body parts and the like. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration is Permanent.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Ghost Sound ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound the spell creates when casting it, and you cannot thereafter change its basic character. The volume of sound created, however, depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level [maximum 20 humans]. Thus, you can create talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A lion's roar is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a dire cat's roar equals the noise from 20 humans. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You may preprogram the sound so it occurs when a specific event triggers it [it lasts until triggered]. Trigger events can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers work. Triggers react to what appears to be the case, so disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Note that actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A spell cannot distinguish invisible creatures, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level. Regardless of range, the spell can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Ghost Weapon ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a touch, a weapon becomes ghostly and translucent. A character can wield it normally, but its attacks ignore armor and natural armor bonuses to Armor Class. At the same time, treat its strikes as force damage when attacking incorporeal foes. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The weapon inflicts only half normal damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Incorporeal creatures can wield the ghostly weapon, allowing them to make attacks against corporeal opponents normally, still ignoring armor, while remaining incorporeal themselves.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Gird the Warrior ~ MP.MOD			DESC:This spell enshrouds its subject with tangible, visible force energy in the form of a mighty set of plate armor. The subject of this effect gains a +10 armor bonus to Armor Class and a +4 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls made with melee weapons. The armor has no associated armor check penalties or spell failure chances, and it weighs nothing. A subject needs no proficiency to use this armor. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell grants a +8 armor bonus to Armor Class and no bonus to attack and damage rolls. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: This version of the gird the warrior spell grants a +12 armor bonus to Armor Class, in addition to the +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Glamour ~ MP.MOD					DESC:You ensorcel yourself to appear beautiful to anyone looking upon you. Not only will they find you attractive, but all your Bluff, Diplomacy, and Gather Information checks against those looking at you gain a +5 circumstance bonus. This spell does not change any specific details of your appearance, such as gender, race, and so forth. However, it does prove quite useful to cast in conjunction with sorcerous guise. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You also gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma for the duration of the spell.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Glowglobe ~ MP (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell creates a 3-inch sphere that glows softly with the light of a torch, shedding illumination in a 20-foot radius from the point you touch. The effect is immobile. Plus, a greater glowglobe cast in an area of magical darkness dispels the darkness, if it comes from a lower-level effect. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The greater glowglobe moves as you will it. You control its movement as a free action. However, it never moves farther than 20 feet from your position.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Glowglobe ~ MP (Lesser).MOD			DESC:This spell creates a 3-inch sphere that glows softly with the light of a torch, shedding illumination in a 20-foot radius from the point you touch. The effect is immobile. A lesser glowglobe does not function in an area of magical darkness. The globe can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The lesser glowglobe moves as you will it. You control its movement as a free action. However, it never moves farther than 10 feet from your position.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Greenspy ~ MP.MOD					DESC:You make a plant into a spy of sorts. For the duration of the spell, all activities- sight and sound-that occur within 50 feet of the plant are "stored" magically within the plant. At any time afterward, you [and only you] can touch the plant and experience the information stored within it. Once you have accessed the information, you cannot do so again. The plant's "senses" are normal-it cannot see in the dark, it cannot see invisible creatures, and so on. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes only one minute per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration is Permanent.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Gusting Wind ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a strong blast of air that originates from you and moves in the direction you face. The force of this gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. The gust causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly, and it has a 50 percent chance to extinguish these lights. Corporeal creatures size Large or smaller who fail the saving throw are knocked down. Creatures who are knocked down suffer 2d6 points of air damage. Any creature is entitled to a saving throw to ignore the gust's effects. Gusting wind can do anything a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The wind cannot knock down creatures. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The wind extinguishes even protected flames and continues to blow for 1d4+1 rounds [dismissible]. Each round in the area, creatures must make saves or be knocked down.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Harden ~ MP.MOD					DESC:You increase an object's hardness by 50 percent or by +1, whichever is greater. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You increase the hardness by +1 no matter what, and the duration becomes 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You double the hardness.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Hygiene ~ MP.MOD					DESC:You clean the subject creature, ridding it of dirt, sweat, contamination, foul odors, and so on. This spell not only makes the subject presentable for fine company, it promotes better health. For 24 hours after the casting, the subject gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all saves against disease. Used frequently, this spell can help stave off tooth decay and other such minor maladies, although this has no in-game effect. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can affect one creature per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Icebolt ~ MP.MOD					DESC:A bolt of razor-sharp ice launches from the palm of your hand at a single target. You must make a normal [not a touch] ranged attack roll; if you succeed, the bolt inflicts 2d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per level [maximum +10]. If the attack roll misses, calculate whether it would have hit as a ranged touch attack. If so, then the bolt strikes and inflicts only the cold damage. If the ranged touch attack missed as well, there is no effect. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The icebolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per level [maximum +5]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can create one icebolt per round and launch it as a standard action for 1 round per two caster levels [maximum five bolts].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Illusory Creature ~ MP (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell creates the visual illusion of a creature the way you imagine it looks. The illusion also creates sound, smell, texture, and temperature, and the greater illusory creature can move as you direct [requiring concentration]. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's duration has a maximum of 1 round per caster level, a range of Close [25 feet + 5 feet per level], and an effect the size of a single 10-foot cube. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can create figments of multiple creatures within the area.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Illusory Creature ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:This spell creates the visual illusion of a creature the way you imagine it looks. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature, but the lesser illusory creature can move as you direct. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's duration has a maximum of 1 round per caster level, a range of Close [25 feet + 5 feet per level], and an effect the size of a single 10- foot cube. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The lesser illusory creature makes sounds appropriate to the illusion [but no more than you could create with a ghost sound spell].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Illusory Object ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:This spell creates the visual illusion of an object or a force [such as a fire] the way you imagine it looks. The illusion also creates sound, smell, texture, and temperature. The greater illusory object can move as you direct [requiring concentration]. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's duration has a maximum of 1 round per caster level, a range of Close [25 feet + 5 feet per level], and an effect the size of a single 10-foot cube. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can create figments of multiple objects within the area.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Illusory Object ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:This spell creates the visual illusion of a static, immobile, solid object the way you imagine it looks. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's duration has a maximum of 1 round per caster level, a range of Close [25 feet + 5 feet per level], and an effect the size of a single 10-foot cube. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The lesser illusory object makes sounds appropriate to the illusion [as you could create with a ghost sound spell].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Invisibility ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The creature or object touched becomes impossible to see with normal sight or even with darkvision. If the subject is a creature carrying gear, the gear vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or can employ magic to do so. Items that an invisible creature drops or puts down become visible; items an invisible creature picks up disappear if tucked into the creature's clothing or pouches. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so [thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source]. Any part of an item the subject carries that extends more than 10 feet from him becomes visible, such as a trailing rope. The subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render him detectable [such as stepping in a puddle]. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an "attack" includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. [Exactly who is a foe depends on the subject's perceptions.] Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the invisibility. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Spells that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their areas. A subject that attacks directly immediately becomes visible, along with all gear. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes Concentration [one minute per level maximum]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: For 1 round per level, the invisible subject can make "attacks" and still not become visible. After this period the spell continues normally, but " attacks" end the invisibility.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Invisibility Prohibition ~ MP.MOD		DESC:You fill an area with magical energy that negates all forms of invisibility. Anything that is invisible becomes visible while in the area. The area remains immobile. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must make an opposed caster power check against the caster level of the invisibility effect in order to reveal a particular invisible creature or object. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You may cast invisibility prohibition upon a single creature or object [the subject gets a Will saving throw to avoid, and spell resistance applies], allowing the area to move with the creature or object.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Levitate ~ MP.MOD					DESC:Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the target up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move-equivalent action. You cannot move the target horizontally with levitate, but the target could clamber along the face of a cliff or push against a ceiling to move laterally [generally at half base speed]. A levitating creature who attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has an attack roll penalty of -1, the second -2, and so on, up to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's range becomes Personal, with You as the target. You cannot levitate more than 5 feet off the ground. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can move up to 60 feet vertically and also up to 10 feet horizontally in a single round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Lion's Form ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You change yourself into a dire lion. Your type changes to Animal. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night [though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further]. If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead. You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a dire lion but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the lion's bite and claw damage, Armor Class, speed, improved grab, pounce, rake, low-light vision, and scent. You retain your own skills and feats and gain the lion's feats and racial bonuses to skills [but not its skill ranks]. Equipment worn is subsumed into the lion's form, but it is nonfunctional. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You change into a normal lion rather than a dire lion. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You gain a +2 bonus to attacks and damage, natural armor bonus to Armor Class, saves, and checks while in the lion form. Magic items worn retain their powers if applicable [a ring of protection, but not a +2 sword].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Living Athame ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Your athame attacks on its own like a weapon with the dancing quality, as described in Chapter Seven: Magic Items of the DMG. This ability allows it to attack on its own using your base attack bonus. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The weapon suffers a -4 attack penalty. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The weapon gains a +4 luck bonus to attack rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Locate Creature ~ MP.MOD			DESC:Your eyes glow with a blue light as you sense the direction of a known or familiar living creature. As you slowly turn, you sense when you're facing the direction of the creature you're trying to locate, provided the creature is within range. You also know which direction it is moving, if any. The spell can locate a creature of a specific type [such as human or unicorn] or a specific creature you know. It cannot find a creature of a general type [such as humanoid or beast]. To find a specific type of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close [within 30 feet] at least once. If more than one creature of this specific type is within range, you locate the nearest specimen. Attempting to find a specific creature requires a detailed and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual creature, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique character unless you have observed that particular character firsthand [not through divination]. This spell cannot detect objects. The Disguise skill and the sorcerous guise, unknown, and shapechange spells can fool it. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell can detect only a specific creature, and you must know its truename for the spell to work. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You may double the spell's range.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Locate Object ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Your eyes glow with a blue light, and you sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. The spell locates such objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder. You can search for general items such as a stairway, a sword, or a jewel; if more than one of its type is within range, you locate the nearest specimen. Attempting to find a specific item, such as a particular piece of jewelry, requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique object [such as "Baron Vulden's signet ring"] unless you have observed that particular item firsthand [not through divination]. Lead blocks locate object. This spell cannot detect creatures. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You cannot detect specific objects, only general ones [you can look for swords, but not a specific sword]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You may double the spell's range.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Location Loresight ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You learn something significant about an area in which you stand. Although the area is a 30-foot spread, if indoors, the spell basically affects one room [the room where you stand]. Go through this list, in order; the first bit of lore you do not know, you learn through this spell: 1. When the location was created [if man-made, otherwise skip]. 2. Name of last creature to pass through location, if any [other than you]. 3. Race of last creature to pass through location, if any [other than you]. 4. Name of the location's creator [a natural location, like a glen, was created by nature]. 5. Race of the location's creator, if any. 6. Name of the location's longest occupant, if any. 7. Race of the location's longest occupant, if any. 8. Name and race of the current owner or master of the location, if any. 9. Brief description of the most significant event to happen in the location. 10. Magical ability or property of the location, if any [random if more than one]. Multiple castings allow you to gain multiple bits of information. If you know all of the above information, this spell teaches you nothing.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Magic Armor ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Magic armor gives a harness of armor or a shield a +1 enhancement bonus to Armor Class. This spell can also be cast on a creature with no armor, giving a +1 armor bonus to clothing or flesh. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell lasts for 1 round per two levels [maximum 5 rounds]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The enhancement bonus bestowed by the spell stacks with the enhancement bonus of the armor, if any.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Magic Circle ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Beams of dark blue energy flash from your fingers to trace on the ground an intricate circle of magical symbols made of energy. This spell wards all creatures in the area from attacks by outsiders and from mental control. The subjects get a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made by outsiders. The barrier blocks any attempt to possess a warded creature or to exercise mental control over the creature. The protection does not prevent a spell or effect that grants mental commands from being cast on the creature, but it keeps the caster of such a spell from mentally commanding the protected creature. If the warding effect ends before the mental control effect does, the caster would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This spell has a special function you may choose when casting it. You can focus a magic circle inward rather than outward. In this case, it serves as an immobile, temporary magical prison for a summoned creature. Creatures summoned inside a magic circle cannot cross the circle's boundaries. This is particularly useful in conjunction with the call outsider or call undead spells. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of magic circle, the spell acts as normal for that creature only. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You can only focus the spell inward; thus it serves only as a magical prison. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: If you know the truename of a creature, you can choose whether to allow the creature to cross the boundaries of the circle [either direction].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Magic Weapon ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Magic weapon gives a melee or ranged weapon a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls. You can also cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike or a beast's claw attack, or on ranged weapon ammunition [one spell affects up to 50 pieces of ammunition- arrows, sling stones, bolts, shuriken, and so on]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell lasts for 1 round, allowing the wielder to make a single round's worth of attacks with it. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus the spell bestows is a luck bonus, so it stacks with the weapon's enhancement bonus, if any.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Magnetism ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Your hand becomes magnetic. If you hold a metal object, you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to resist attempts to disarm you of it. You also gain a +10 circumstance bonus to climb up a metal surface or object [like an iron pipe]. Further, when you focus your attention [requiring concentration] on a metal or mostly metal object within 5 feet + 1 foot per caster level weighing less than 1 lb. per level, you drag it toward you at a rate of 1 foot per round. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The circumstance bonus becomes +5 for resisting disarm attempts and climbing. You cannot draw objects toward you unless they weigh less than 1 lb. and are no more than 5 feet away. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: As much or as little of your body as you desire becomes magnetic, allowing you to hold in each hand a metal object that gains a +10 bonus to avoid disarm attempts. You gain a +10 circumstance bonus to climbing for each magnetic limb that clings to a metallic surface. You can attach a knife to your leg without straps, stand on a metallic plate on the ceiling, and so on.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Mark Allies ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a touch from your blue-haloed hand, you designate a creature [or creatures] as your ally. For the spell's duration, the designated creatures remain unaffected by any spell of 3rd level or lower that you cast unless they wish to be affected-as though they had spell resistance and you failed your check. Thus, they can stand in the middle of your sorcerous blast unscathed, or walk through a wall of ice of your creation. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects one creature and protects it only from the next spell cast within the duration. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell affects one ally per level and protects them from all the spells you cast for the duration.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Mind Stab ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You focus your mind and create an invisible mental blast that emanates from your head and stabs the mind of another. You must make a ranged touch attack to use the blast to strike a foe. If it hits, you deal 1d6 points of subdual damage + 1 point per level [maximum +10]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You deal 1d4 points of subdual damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: An affected subject also must a make Will saving throw or be dazed for 1 round. Dazed characters can't take actions-move, cast spells, use mental abilities, etc.-but they are not stunned.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Minor Illusion ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You create a tiny, immobile image- a very small dagger, a floating ball, a miniature face, etc.-in your open palm. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The object can move and moves with you, so you can pretend to wield a tiny illusionary dagger or create the image of a tiny dancing monkey in your hand.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Modify Memory ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You reach into the target's mind and modify up to five minutes of her memory in one of the following ways: 1. Eliminate all memory of an event the target actually experienced. This spell cannot negate spells that affect the subject's mind. 2. Allow the target to recall with perfect clarity an event she actually experienced. 3. Change the details of an event the target actually experienced. 4. Implant a memory of an event the target never experienced. Casting the spell takes a standard action. If the target fails the save, you proceed with the spell by spending up to five minutes [a period of time equal to the amount of memory time you want to modify] visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the target. If anything disturbs your concentration before the visualization is complete, or if the subject ever moves beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost. A modified memory does not necessarily affect the target's actions, particularly if it contradicts her natural inclinations. The target may dismiss an illogical modified memory as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modify memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with you [inclining the target to act favorably toward you], changing the details of a superior's orders to the target, or causing the target to forget she ever saw you or your party. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory seems too nonsensical to affect the target significantly. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You can modify one minute of memories. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can modify up to 30 minutes of memories.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Mudball ~ MP.MOD					DESC:A ball of grey-brown mud appears in your hand. You can throw this ball with no penalties up to the range of the spell, making a normal ranged [not touch] attack. If successful, the target suffers 1d8 points of earth and water damage [half each] + 1 point of damage per caster level [maximum +5]. Further, if the target has eyes and does not have damage reduction, the attack blinds it for 1 round. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The mudball inflicts only 1d6 points of damage and has no other effects. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The mudball inflicts 1d8 points of earth and water damage [half each] + 1d8 additional damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Muddy Ground ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Assuming the ground in the area is at least partially made of earth or stone, you turn the top 3 inches of the surface into mud. Creatures in the area move at half speed and must succeed at a Balance check [DC 15] each round that they take an action in the area; failure means they slip and fall prone in the mud. The mud disappears when the spell ends. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Because the mud is only 1 inch deep, movement is unaffected [Balance check, DC 10]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The mud in the area becomes 12 inches deep, cutting movement to a quarter normal.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Neutralize Poison ~ MP.MOD			DESC:If your caster power check beats the poison's Difficulty Class, you detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional damage or effects from the poison, and any temporary effects end, but the spell does not reverse Instantaneous effects such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own. This spell also neutralizes the poison in a poisonous creature or object. A poisonous creature replenishes its poison at its normal rate. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The caster power check suffers a -3 penalty. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: In addition to the normal effects, this spell heals damage inflicted by poisons within the last hour.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Object Loresight ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You learn something significant about an object you touch. Go through this list, in order; the first bit of lore you do not know, you learn through this spell: 1. Age of object. 2. Name of last creature to touch the object, if any [other than you]. 3. Race of last creature to touch the object, if any [other than you]. 4. Name of the object's creator [a natural object, like a rock, was created by nature]. 5. Race of the object's creator, if any. 6. Object's purpose. 7. Material[s] that makes up the object. 8. Location of the object's creation. 9. Name of the most recent owner of the object, if any. 10. Magical ability of the object, if any [random if more than one]. Multiple castings allow you to gain multiple bits of information. If you know all of the above information, this spell teaches you nothing.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Obscuring Mist ~ MP.MOD				DESC:A misty vapor arises around the caster. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has one-half concealment [attacks have a 20 percent miss chance]. Creatures farther away have total concealment [50 percent miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target]. A moderate wind [11 mph or more] disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind [21 mph or more] disperses it in 1 round. A fire spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. This spell does not function underwater. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The area becomes a 5-foot spread that is 8 feet high. The duration becomes 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The cloud moves as you direct, ignoring the wind, up to 10 feet per round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Open Door ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You cause one door to open, regardless of how it is sealed, barred, or locked. Even if affected by multiple locks, an iron bar, and a lesser sealed door spell, the door opens. Even if a giant is holding the door closed, it opens. You still must overcome the resistance of a door sealed by greater sealed door. A door sealed by a heightened greater sealed door spell is immune to this spell. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The door can be no larger than 6 feet high, 3 feet wide, and 1 inch thick. It remains open for only 1 round per two caster levels [maximum 10 rounds]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell's range becomes Close [25 feet + 5 feet per two levels], and you can use this spell to affect doors for 1 round per two caster levels,|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Open Lock ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You cause one lock to unlock if your caster power check beats the lock's Difficulty Class. For a door affected by a lesser or greater sealed door spell, the caster power check must overcome the Difficulty Class in the spell's description. Multiple locks require multiple castings of the spell. A magically sealed door that is also locked requires two castings. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The lock remains open for only 1 round per two caster levels [maximum 5 rounds].

Precise Vision ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You can see details, either small or distant, much more clearly than normal. In addition, you gain a +5 competence bonus to Spot and Search checks. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes only +1, and the duration becomes 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes +10.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Predict Weather ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You learn what type of weather the surrounding locality will experience tomorrow. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell has only a 50 percent chance of predicting the weather correctly. Casting it more than once yields the same result each time.

Protect Staff ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You create a protective force field around a staff, adding +1 to its hardness plus an additional +1 for every two caster levels you have above 1st.

Protection From Elements ~ MP.MOD		DESC:This abjuration grants a creature temporary invulnerability to the selected elemental type [air, earth, fire, or water]. When protection from elements absorbs 12 points of elemental damage per caster level, it is discharged. The spell protects the target's equipment as well as himself. Protection from elements absorbs only hit point damage. The target could still suffer unfortunate side effects. The spell takes on the descriptor of the chosen element. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one minute per level, and the protection covers only 6 points of elemental damage per caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell provides 20 points of protection per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Protection From Energy ~ MP.MOD		DESC:This abjuration grants a creature temporary invulnerability to the selected energy type [acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic]. When protection from energy absorbs 20 points of energy damage per caster level, it is discharged. The spell protects the target's equipment as well. Protection from energy absorbs only hit point damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects. The spell takes on the descriptor of the chosen energy type. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one minute per level, and the protection covers only 12 points of energy damage per caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell provides 30 points of protection per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Protective Charm ~ MP.MOD			DESC:With a flash of bright light, you charm creatures so that they will not attack you. The spell alters their behavior in only one way: If they wish to attack you, they choose to do something else [move away, attack someone else, and so on, depending on the creature and the situation]. The spell works against creatures of the same general type as the caster. So if you are a litorian, the spell works against all humanoids. If you are a medusa, it works against all monstrous humanoids. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects only one target. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell affects any type of living creature.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Read Magic ~ MP.MOD				DESC:By means of read magic, you can read magical inscriptions on objects-books, scrolls, weapons, and the like-that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once you have cast the spell and read the magical inscription, you can thereafter read that particular writing without read magic. You can read at the rate of one page [250 words] per minute. The spell also allows you to identify a rune created by a runethane.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Read Mind ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You can read the surface thoughts of another creature. When casting read mind upon a creature of animal intelligence [Intelligence score of 1 or 2] you can pick up only simple, instinctual thoughts. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 1 round. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can switch targets during the duration; each target gets its own Will save. A target that makes a successful save cannot be affected later by the same casting.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Remove Curse ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Remove curse takes away all curses from an object or a person if you succeed at a caster power check [either opposed by the caster of each curse or with a Difficulty Class equal to the save DC of each curse, whichever is appropriate]. Remove curse does not take the curse away from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the character afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell does not remove the curse, but it does suppress the effects for 1d6 hours. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You gain a +5 bonus to the caster power check to remove the curse.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Remove Disease ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Remove disease cures all diseases that the subject suffers from if you succeed in a caster power check against the saving throw Difficulty Class of the disease. This spell also kills parasites. Since the spell's duration is Instantaneous, it does not prevent re-infection if the subject is exposed to the same disease again later. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The caster power check suffers a -3 penalty. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: In addition to the normal effects, the spell heals any damage inflicted by diseases within the last week.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Remove Malady ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Remove malady takes away one horrible malady affecting a creature, such as paralysis, blindness, deafness, madness, petrification, vitrification, fear, a poison, or a disease. You must succeed at a caster power check against the caster of the spell that inflicted the malady or against the malady's Difficulty Class, whichever seems more appropriate. However, if the malady is the natural result of some other injury [paralysis due to spinal injury, blindness due to destroyed eyes, and so on], regeneration is the only recourse. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Even after a successful caster power check, there is only a 50 percent chance that the spell will work. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The casting time becomes one standard action.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Repair ~ MP (Greater).MOD			DESC:As lesser repair, except that it can restore even an object shattered into bits, although the object must weigh no more than 50 lbs. per caster level in its finished form. If an object is damaged, this spell restores 1d6 of its lost hit points per caster level [maximum 10d6], no matter what its size. Greater repair can repair a magic item but does not restore the item's magical abilities. You can even use this spell to repair ramshackle [but still relatively whole] buildings or breaches in a castle's walls, for example. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: This spell can restore only broken or damaged objects up to 20 lbs. per caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: This spell can repair broken items of up to 100 lbs. per caster level, and it restores 1d8 hit points per level to a damaged object [maximum 15d8].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Repair ~ MP (Lesser).MOD			DESC:You repair a broken or damaged object as it hums and glows with an orange light. For example, this spell will weld a broken ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger. You can invisibly rejoin pieces of ceramic or wooden objects to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or wineskin is completely mended with lesser repair. If an object is damaged, this spell restores 1d10 of its lost hit points. The spell can repair a magic item but does not restore the item's magical abilities. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The object can weigh up to 10 lbs. per caster level; when restoring an object's lost hit points, the spell restores 2d6 points + 1 point per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Resilient Sphere ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:With a wave of your hand, a globe of force encloses a single creature [and only one], provided the creature is small enough to fit within the sphere. The sphere contains the subject for the spell's duration. The sphere can withstand 100 points of damage per caster level. Attacks on the sphere do not harm the subject. Nothing can pass through the globe, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the only effect is to move the sphere slightly-the subject cannot damage it. The globe can be physically moved, either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The sphere has only 25 hit points per caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The sphere has 200 hit points per caster level and can measure up to 2 feet per level in diameter.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Resistance ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The target gains a momentary halo of soft violet light. For the duration, the target enjoys a +1 resistance bonus to all saving throws. For every five caster levels, the target gains an additional +1 to the resistance bonus [maximum +5]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus never exceeds +1, and it applies only to the first saving throw made during the duration. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one hour per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Restoration ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Restoration dispels any magical effects reducing one of the subject's ability scores. The spell also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if one day per caster level or less has passed since the subject lost it. The spell cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores 1 point permanently drained from a single ability score [caster's choice if more than one is drained]. Restoration never restores levels or Constitution points lost due to death. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell cures only temporary ability damage in one score. It does not restore lost levels, though it does dispel negative levels. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell restores all lost levels and all points permanently drained from a single ability score.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Revivification ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Your hands glow with bright green energy, which you transfer to a corpse you touch. The energy brings one dead creature immediately back to life. The target cannot have been dead for more than one minute per caster level. The target has 1 hp per Hit Die. Any ability scores damaged to 0 increase to 1. Any spell slots available at the time of death are still available to the target now. Spells active on the target whose durations have not ended remain active. The process of revivifying the subject does not cure normal poison and normal disease, nor does it undo magical diseases and curses. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be revivified must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature comes back to life. This spell does not affect any of the dead creature's equipment or possessions in any way. The target stays alive for the duration, after which time it dies again [regardless of any healing gained] unless someone casts stabilize soul spell on the target. Revivification does not work on targets who die a second time in this way. [If a creature returns from the dead thanks to raise the dead or is stabilized with stabilize soul, then dies again in different circumstances, revivification will work again]. An undead creature targeted with this spell must make a Will saving throw or become normally dead once again. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes only 1 round per level. The spell has no effect on undead. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one hour per level. If raise the dead is cast [once] on a target under the effects of this spell, the creature remains alive [as normal] and loses a point of permanent Constitution drain rather than a level. A 1st-level character loses a point of Constitution normally.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Rouse Ghostly Army ~ MP.MOD			DESC:This spell allows you to create and control one incorporeal undead creature per caster level exactly as described in rouse undead spirit. This spell requires 1,000 gp in special oils per corpse as a material component to be sprinkled over each body. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The undead move at only half their normal move rate, gain no Dexterity bonus [see creature template in Chapter Twelve], and can take only one action per round, either a move-equivalent or a standard action, but not both.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Safe Fall ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The creatures or objects affected by this spell, even though they fall at the normal rate, suffer no damage if they fall less than 50 feet + 10 feet per caster level. A target that falls into sharp objects, like spikes, suffers half damage from them. This spell does not protect a target from damage sustained by falling into a hazardous substance, like lava or acid. You can cast safe fall quickly enough to save someone who unexpectedly falls. Casting the spell is a free action and can be cast out of turn, although no more than once per round. This spell has no special effect on a piece of ammunition from a ranged weapon unless it is falling quite a distance. If you cast safe fall on a falling item, the item deals half normal damage based on weight, with no bonus for the drop's height. The spell works only on free-falling objects. It doesn't affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects only one creature or object [of up to Medium size]; one can safely fall 10 feet per level [maximum 50 feet]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Affected creatures or objects can fall an unlimited distance without damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Sanction Staff ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You empower a staff, allowing you to cast touch-range spells through it, as if it were a part of you. Thus, you can make a melee attack with your staff and also deliver a touch attack spell. The staff functions this way only in your hands. For example, you cannot cast this spell, cast a touch attack spell, and then hand the staff to someone else to use for the attack. All touch spells are handled normally. This spell does not modify the duration of other spells. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 1 round per level. However, any touch spell cast into the staff has two uses, each usable only once per round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Saving Grace ~ MP.MOD				DESC:A flash of violet surrounds your eyes momentarily. When you cast this spell, you must specify a saving throw type: Fortitude, Reflex, or Will. For the duration, you gain a +1 luck bonus to that saving throw category. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one minute per level, and the bonus is +3.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Scent Bane ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The scent ability does not help creatures find targets of this spell; they have no scent. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 10 minutes per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Scent Tracker ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You gain the scent ability [as described below] and can use it to help find creatures, track, and so on. You can identify familiar odors just as you do familiar sights. You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. For upwind opponents, the range increases to 60 feet; if they are downwind, it drops to 15 feet. You can detect strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When you detect a scent, you don't determine its exact source, only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a standard action to note the direction of the scent. If you move within 5 feet of the source, you can pinpoint that source. You can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. Following a fresh trail is typically DC 10 [no matter what kind of surface holds the scent]. This Difficulty Class increases or decreases depending on the strength of the quarry's odor, the number of creatures, and the trail's age. For each hour that the trail has grown colder, the Difficulty Class increases by 2. Otherwise, follow the rules for the Track feat, but ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Duration becomes 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one hour per level. You gain a +5 bonus to all checks to track with scent.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Scream ~ MP.MOD					DESC:You let loose with a shrill scream. A target you designate [no attack roll needed] suffers 1d8 points of sonic damage + 1 point of temporary Constitution damage +1 point of Constitution damage per five caster levels. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The target suffers only 1d8 points of sonic damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The target is stunned for 1 round in addition to the spell's other effects.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Scrying ~ MP.MOD					DESC:Succeeding at a caster power check allows you to see and hear another creature, who may be at any distance from you. The Difficulty Class of the check depends on how well you know the creature and what sort of physical connection [if any] you have to that creature [see tables, below]. Furthermore, if the creature is on another plane, you suffer a -5 penalty on the caster power check. This spell creates a magical sensor located near the subject; the sensor cannot move. Any creature with Intelligence 12 or higher can notice the sensor by making a Spot check [DC 20]. However, only you may see through the scrying sensor. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Casting this version of the spell requires a focus component: a mirror worth at least 1,000 gp. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The caster may cast these spells through a scrying spell: darkvision, read magic, read mind, and tongues. Detect magic and telepathy have a 5 percent chance per caster level of operating correctly.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Sealed Door ~ MP (Lesser).MOD			DESC:You create a magical seal around a door [or the lid of a chest or similar doorlike construction] that makes it difficult to open. This seal cannot be picked like a lock, nor can it be disabled like a trap. One can open the door by forcing it with brute strength [break DC 25]. If the door is already stuck, locked, or barred, lesser sealed door adds a +10 bonus to the normal break Difficulty Class. A character with the Brandish Magical Might feat can also open the door with a successful caster power check [DC 25]. Bypass ward can suppress this spell if a caster succeeds at a caster power check [DC 17]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one hour per level, with a break DC 20, or +5 normal. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The caster can set up a password or special key to allow anyone to negate the seal for 1 round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Sealed Door ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:You create a magical seal around a door [or the lid of a chest or similar doorlike construction] that makes it difficult to open. Further, the door becomes virtually impervious to harm and resistant to magic. This seal cannot be picked like a lock, nor can it be disabled like a trap. One can open the door by forcing it with brute strength [break DC 35]. If the door is already stuck, locked, or barred, the greater sealed door spell adds a +20 bonus to the normal break Difficulty Class. A character with the Brandish Magical Might feat can also open the door with a successful caster power check [DC 35]. Further, the door gains 20 points of hardness and SR 25 to resist spells that would affect it, such as disintegration, bypass ward, or open door. You can set up a password or a special key to allow anyone to negate the seal for 1 round. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The door's hardness increases by +5, and the door gains no spell resistance. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The door's hit points double, and it has SR 30. It becomes immune to open door.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
See Invisibility ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You see any invisible objects or beings as if they were visible normally. Invisible creatures appear to have a bit of a glow around them [so you know they must be invisible to others]. See invisibility does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures that are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: One other creature that is touching you can also see invisible objects or beings.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Seeker ~ MP.MOD					DESC:Your eyes glow with golden power until the spell ends. Next time you make a ranged attack, add a +2 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls. Used once, the spell ends. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus is +5.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Sense Thoughts ~ MP.MOD				DESC:After you have used contact on a creature, at any time for the next 24 hours you can cast sense thoughts if that creature were within range. You do not need to have line of sight to the creature. This spell reveals the creature's location and emotional state. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You do not need to have used contact on the target[s] previously- you become aware of the locations of all thinking beings within range who fail their saving throw.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Shock ~ MP.MOD					DESC:A creature you touch with your crackling, lightning-filled hand suffers 1d4 points of electricity damage + 1 point of temporary Dexterity damage, +1 point of Dexterity damage per five caster levels. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The subject suffers only 1d4 points of damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The subject is stunned for a round as well.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Shield Companion ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You create one unattended heavy shield, which floats magically around you, protecting you as if you were using it. You suffer none of the normal penalties for using a shield, such as check penalties, maximum Dexterity, and spell failure chances. For the rest of the duration, you have both hands free and need not devote any actions to making sure the shield protects you. If anyone attempts to snatch the shield away, the spell resists it as if you were indeed wearing the shield, so a normal disarm attempt is necessary. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The shield is a light shield. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The shield also gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Armor Class for the duration.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Silent Sheath ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Affected creatures are sheathed in silence and can make no sound. This effect proves useful to someone wishing to sneak around, but becomes a bane to anyone attempting to use verbal spell components or sonic abilities [both become impossible]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell only dampens sound. Affected characters gain a +10 bonus to Sneak checks used to oppose Listen checks. Spellcasters attempting to use verbal spell components have a 25 percent spell failure chance. Sonic attacks go unaffected. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell affects one creature per two caster levels or lasts one minute per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Slow ~ MP.MOD					DESC:Affected creatures move and attack at a drastically slowed rate. A slowed creature can take either one move-equivalent action or one standard action each round, but not both. Additionally, it suffers a -2 penalty to Armor Class, melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and Reflex saves. Slowed creatures jump half as far as normal. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects only one target.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Sorcerous Blast ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You create a burst of elemental energy that detonates with a blast and deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d6] to all creatures and unattended objects within the area. You must choose the elemental type [air, earth, fire, or water] when you cast sorcerous blast; the spell takes on the appropriate descriptor. You determine the range [distance and height] at which the burst occurs. A beam of light streaks from you and, unless it impacts upon a solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, explodes in a blast of elemental energy. You can aim the beam like a ray at a specific target. If you successfully strike that target with a ranged touch attack, the target becomes the center of the blast and must make two successful saving throws in order to take half damage. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The beam of light does not cause a blast, but instead affects only the creature struck [who needs to make only one saving throw for half damage]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d8 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d8], and the caster can choose an energy type rather than an elemental type, if desired [the spell takes on the appropriate energy descriptor].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Spell Resistance ~ MP.MOD			DESC:When you touch a creature with your red, glowing hand, it gains spell resistance equal to 12 + caster level. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell offers resistance only against 3rd-level spells or below. The spell resistance equals 5 + caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell resistance equals 16 + caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Spell's Edge ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:You infuse your athame with an Instantaneous spell that requires a melee touch attack to deliver. You must cast the infused spell immediately after you cast this one. Then, the first opponent you strike with the blade has the spell cast upon him, as well as suffering whatever damage you normally would deal. The infused spell is resolved normally, with saving throws and spell resistance, if any, still applicable. For example, you could infuse your athame with touch of weakness or touch of fear, or, if you had access to 1st-level complex spells, touch of pain. You could not infuse your athame with destructive grip, since it is not Instantaneous [unless you used the diminished version]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You can only infuse a melee touch spell of 0 or 1st level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration of the spell becomes 10 minutes/level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Spirit of Prowess ~ MP.MOD			DESC:A faint aura of shimmering energy surrounds you as you call upon spiritual powers to aid you in combat. You gain a +6 competence bonus to two attack rolls of your choice. Choosing to use this bonus is a free action that you must take before you make your attack roll, and you can only do it once per round. You must make the attacks before the spell's duration ends. At 10th caster level, you gain an additional +6 bonus to one attack roll [so the spell modifies three attacks]. At 15th level you can modify four attacks; at 20th level you modify five attacks; and at 25th level you can modify six attacks. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus to the attacks becomes +3, and the spell lasts only one minute per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes +10.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Stamina to Defense ~ MP.MOD			DESC:To cast this spell, you must cut yourself, devoting 2 points of your own Constitution [which you suffer as temporary damage] to dripping your blood onto an armor harness or shield. That armor gains a +4 luck bonus to Armor Class for the spell's duration. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The luck bonus to Armor Class becomes +2. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The luck bonus to Armor Class becomes +6.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Startling Touch ~ MP.MOD			DESC:With a sudden mental jolt passed through your touch, you inflict 1 point of temporary Wisdom damage on a creature and stun it for 1 round. A stunned creature drops everything held, can't take actions, suffers a -2 penalty to Armor Class, and loses all Dexterity bonus to Armor Class [if any]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The creature suffers only the Wisdom damage and is not stunned. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The creature remains stunned for 1d3 rounds.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Steal Health ~ MP.MOD				DESC:Your hand crackles with blood-red lightning. You inflict 3d8 points of damage on the touched target, then heal that many points of damage on yourself.

Stone Arm ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a flash of yellow light, you transform one arm of a foe from flesh to stone. The arm becomes unusable.

HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Two arms are petrified.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Stone Blast ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a simple gesture, you cause a mass of earth and stone to tear itself from the ground [or other source of stone within 20 feet] and fly at a designated target. You make a ranged attack [not a touch attack] to strike the target. The stone blast inflicts 1d6 points of earth damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d6]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d4 points of damage and does not increase with level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d8] and also knocks down creatures of size Medium or smaller who fail a Fortitude saving throw.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Stone Leg ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a flash of yellow light, you transform one leg of a foe from flesh to stone. The leg becomes unusable. The foe moves at one-quarter speed [unless it has more than two legs, in which case it moves at half speed; creatures with more than 10 legs are unhindered]. Round to the nearest multiple of five, so a character with speed 30 now moves at 10. Creatures with all their legs petrified cannot move and fall prone. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes one minute per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Two legs are petrified.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Strength to Strike ~ MP.MOD			DESC:In casting this spell, you sweat a drop of blood, devoting 2 points of your own Strength [which you suffer as temporary damage] and dripping the blood onto a weapon. That weapon inflicts +2d6 points of damage for the duration of the strength to strike spell. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus to damage becomes +1d6. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus to damage becomes +3d6.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Subtle Steps ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You gain a +5 competence bonus to Sneak checks. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes +1. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The bonus becomes +10.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Suggestion ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You influence the actions of the enchanted creature by suggesting a course of activity [limited to a sentence or two]. You must word the suggestion in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the target can complete the suggested activity in a shorter time, the spell ends when the enchanted creature finishes it. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the target does not perform the activity. A very reasonable suggestion causes the target to make the save with a penalty [such as -1, -2, etc.], at the DM's discretion. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell's duration becomes one minute per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Whether or not the target makes the save, she must make a second Will saving throw. If the second save fails, the target has no idea that you cast a spell on her and does not remember the suggestion at all.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Tears of Pain ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You create this minor curse when you take one of your own tears and crush it between your fingers. The target suffers a -1 circumstance penalty to saving throws, due to wracking pain that flares up whenever he is threatened. As a side effect, however, the spell acts as an "after-thefact" sort of danger sense. [This provides little benefit, because targets almost always know when they have to make saving throws.] Since this is a curse, it cannot be dispelled. Only remove curse can deal with it. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes only 1 round per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The target suffers a -2 penalty to saves.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Summon Minor Elemental ~ MP (Lesser).MOD	DESC:This spell summons an elemental. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the elemental, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. Summoned elementals act normally on the last round of the spell and disappear at the end of their turn. The spell conjures one Small elemental. You choose which kind to summon and can change that choice each time the spell is cast. The spell takes on the descriptor of the type of elemental summoned: air, earth, fire, or water. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must concentrate on the summoned elemental's actions, or it remains motionless. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The summoned elemental enjoys +1 hp per Hit Die, a +1 bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Summon Minor Elemental ~ MP (Greater).MOD	DESC:As lesser summon minor elemental, except that you summon a Medium elemental instead. Alternatively, you can summon 1d3 Small elementals. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You must concentrate on the summoned elemental's actions, or it remains motionless. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The summoned elemental is Large.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Telekinesis ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. The greater telekinesis spell provides a gentle, sustained force, moving a creature or object weighing up to 25 lbs. per caster level up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. Using greater telekinesis, you can move the weight vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be moved beyond the spell's range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops. You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand: You can pull levers or telekinetically manipulate a bucket to fill itself with water from a well. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks against a Difficulty Class set by the DM. Greater telekinesis cannot be used to wield a weapon. Lastly, the spell can be used to exert a force, such as that needed to break open a barred door or keep it closed. In such cases, the telekinetic force has a Strength modifier equal to a quarter of your level plus your Intelligence modifier. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Decrease the weight limit by half. No delicate activity or manipulation is possible. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell can be used to wield a weapon using your base attack bonus and your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier [depending on whether it is a ranged or melee attack].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Telekinesis ~ MP (Lesser).MOD			DESC:You can point a finger at an object and lift and move it at will from a distance. As a move-equivalent action, you can move the object up to 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell's range. You have no fine manipulation skills. You cannot use the spell to move levers or untie knots. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell can affect magical objects.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Telekinesis ~ MP (True).MOD			DESC:As greater telekinesis except that you can affect up to 1,000 lbs. per caster level and move it up to 100 feet per round. If you use the telekinesis to exert force, you make a caster power check as its Strength check. The spell can be used to wield a weapon using a caster power check as the attack roll [ranged or melee], with a +15 bonus to the damage roll. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Decrease the weight limit by half. If using the spell to wield a weapon, use a caster level check as the attack roll and add a +8 bonus to the damage roll.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Telepathy ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to communicate mentally with a familiar creature within range. The communication, though mental, is done entirely with words, so you must speak the same language as the creature. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The creature to communicate with must remain in sight. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The communication includes pictures, concepts, and emotions, so the spell is no longer language dependent. Casters can receive a mental picture clear enough to allow them to scry a person or teleport to a place as though they had viewed the person or place once [for teleporting, this does not count as "currently viewed," even if the telepathy spell functions concurrently with the teleport spell].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Teleport ~ MP.MOD					DESC:This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination. Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible. The characters teleporting travel through invisible magical pathways, known only to powerful spellcasters, that crisscross the world in a mazelike pattern. You must mentally plot a path through these magical conduits ahead of time to successfully use them. You can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 lbs. per caster level. As with all spells where the range is Personal and the target is You, you need not make a saving throw, nor does spell resistance apply. Only objects held or in use [attended] by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. Obviously, you must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination, and your current spatial relation to the destination [if you do not know where you are, you can't teleport from there]. The clearer your mental image and the more time you take developing a magical path to get there, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. In order to successfully plot the course and teleport to it, make a caster level check to which you also add your Intelligence modifier. To determine the check's difficulty, compare your familiarity to the amount of time you invested in developing a path, then consult the table on the next page to find the Difficulty Class. If you attempt to teleport to a place that doesn't exist or that isn't where you thought it was [or if you aren't where you thought you were], the check automatically fails. This can happen because of faulty information. If a teleporter ends up in a random location, the DM should choose the closest similar location to the intended destination. If the caster was attempting to teleport to a temple, he might end up in the closest nearby temple. In truth, the DM should feel free to choose any location he wishes. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: All Difficulty Classes increase by 10, and the weight limit decreases by half. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: All Difficulty Classes decrease by 10, and the weight limit doubles.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Tongues ~ MP.MOD					DESC:This spell grants the subject the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature. The subject can speak only one language at a time, though she may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don't speak. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The subject can understand the language of any intelligent creature, but not speak it. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: In addition to speaking the languages, the subject can read them.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of Dire Doom ~ MP.MOD			DESC:Your hand fulgurates with wild energy. When you touch a creature, that creature suffers 1d3 points of temporary damage to all ability scores. Those making a successful saving throw still suffer 1 point of damage to two random ability scores. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The creature suffers only 1 point of damage to all scores; a successful saving throw negates the effect. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The creature suffers 1d6 points of damage to all scores.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of Disruption ~ MP.MOD			DESC:The touch of your temporarily blackened hand disrupts a creature's body. The target suffers 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per level. Undead are not harmed by this spell; they are healed. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The target suffers 1d4 points of damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The target is stunned for a round as well.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of Fear ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a flash of black energy, you instill fear in a creature you touch. The creature becomes shaken and suffers a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: N/A HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The subject also becomes frightened and tries to flee from you for the spell's duration.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of the Harrid ~ MP.MOD			DESC:With a touch attack, you can drain and consume magic. Should you touch a creature that has a spell effect cast upon it, your touch dispels the effect [the highestlevel effect, if multiple spells are operative]. Make a caster power check against the target spell [DC 15 + the spell's caster level] to succeed. If the creature is a spellcaster but has no spells active upon it, you drain its highest-level spell slot still available, as if the slot were used for that day. This spell has no effect upon nonspellcasters with no spells active upon them. You can choose to touch an item rather than a creature. If the item has a spell effect upon it, it is drained just like a character's. If it has no spell effects upon it but it is a magic item, you suppress the item's powers for 1d4 rounds. You cannot drain the magic from an inplace spell effect, like a lesser eldritch wall or an electrified lair spell. In any case, if you successfully drain some kind of magic, you gain +1d4 temporary hit points. They last until lost or for one hour, whichever comes first. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You gain one touch [the spell's duration is Instantaneous]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You gain +1d8 temporary hit points per drain.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of Nausea ~ MP.MOD			DESC:As the spell emits a foul odor and a low moan, a creature you touch is filled with nausea. The target can take only a single move action on its next turn. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 1 round per two levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of Pain ~ MP.MOD				DESC:While your eyes flash with red power, a creature you touch is wracked with pain. The target suffers a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The subject suffers a -4 morale penalty.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of Weakness ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You inflict 1 point of temporary Strength damage on a creature you touch. The damage is healed when the duration ends. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The damage heals normally. The duration of the spell becomes Instantaneous.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Touch of the Tempest ~ MP.MOD			DESC:Your hand suddenly is surrounded by churning air and water. Your touch inflicts 1d8 points of damage per caster level [10d8 maximum] to any creature touched, half of which is air damage and the other half is water damage. Further, those failing the saving throw are also dazed for 1 round per four caster levels. Dazed characters cannot take actions but suffer no penalty to Armor Class. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Those failing their saves are dazed for 1 round per two caster levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Tracer ~ MP.MOD					DESC:For the duration, you remain aware of the distance and direction of the target object's location. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The object can be a maximum of 10 miles per level from you. If the object leaves this area, the spell ends. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell also works on creatures.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Transfer Wounds ~ MP (Greater).MOD		DESC:As lesser transfer wounds, but you cure 4d10 points of the target's damage + 1 point per caster level [up to +20]. You then immediately suffer half that amount as subdual damage. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You heal 3d10 points of the target's damage + 1 point per caster level [up to +15], and suffer half that amount as subdual damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You heal 5d10 points of the target's damage + 1 point per caster level [up to +25], and suffer half that amount as subdual damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Transfer Wounds ~ MP (Lesser).MOD		DESC:Laying your hand upon a living creature, you cure 1d10 points of the target's damage + 1 point per caster level [up to +5]. You then immediately suffer half that amount as subdual damage. If you cast this spell upon yourself, you transmute 1d10 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [up to +10] to half that amount of subdual damage. You can use this spell offensively against an undead creature, who suffers 1d10 points of damage + 1 point per caster level [up to +10], but you suffer half that amount as subdual damage. An undead creature can attempt a Will save to take half damage. When the damage heals, neither you nor the target are left with any scars or traces of injury. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: You heal 2 points of the target's damage and suffer 1 point of subdual damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You heal 2d10 points of the target's damage + 1 point per caster level [up to +10], and suffer half that amount as subdual damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Undo ~ MP.MOD					DESC:You specify a single effect that has occurred within the previous round and reverse it entirely. The effect can be a spell, a spell-like ability, a supernatural ability, a physical attack, a poison, a disease, a trap, a rune, or anything similar. Damage inflicted by the effect is repaired or healed, slain victims are restored to life [to the condition they were in before the effect], a curse is lifted, and so on-whatever the effect did, this spell undoes it. Note that this spell does not make it so that the effect was never instigated; it only undoes its consequences. So if you cast this spell to undo the effects of an energy bolt spell, the caster of the energy bolt really did cast it [and used the spell slot], but the damage is all repaired. Effects from 7th-level or higher spells [or the equivalent] require that you make a caster power check to undo them. The DC for the caster power check is 20 + spell level [or equivalent] + one half of the caster level of the effect's creator. Thus, if you wish to undo the effects of a 24thlevel magister who cast consume man on your ally, you must make a caster power check with a Difficulty Class of 42 [20 + 10 + [24 ? 2]]. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: If the effect involves other creatures, including the creator of the effect and any victims, you must know the truenames of all involved. The spell gains the truename descriptor.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Unknown ~ MP.MOD					DESC:The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination. Unknown also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If someone attempts a divination against the warded creature or item, the divination's caster must beat you in an opposed caster power check. If you cast unknown on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, your caster power check for this opposed check gains a +5 bonus. If cast on a creature, unknown wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects only objects. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You can choose to ward a non-mobile area [and everything in it as well] up to one 10-foot cube per level in size.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Veil of Darkness ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You create an immobile area of magical darkness in which even creatures that normally can see in the dark cannot see. Normal lights do not work, nor do spells with the light descriptor of a lower level than this spell. A light spell of the same level as this one counters and cancels out a veil of darkness [but is then cancelled itself]. Light spells of a higher level than the veil of darkness spell dispel the darkness. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration is one minute per level, and the darkness is "normal" darkness-creatures with darkvision can see in it. Normal lights, such as lanterns or torches, however, still shed no light in the area. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The area becomes a 20-foot radius spread, and the range is Medium [100 feet + 10 feet/level].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wall of Ice ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A wall of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Fire can melt a wall of ice: It deals full damage to the wall [instead of the half damage that objects normally suffer]. Suddenly melting the wall of ice creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts 10 minutes. Ice Plane: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level [so a 10th-level magister can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, or a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, etc.]. You can orient the plane in any fashion as long as you anchor it. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, but you must anchor a horizontal or slanting wall on two opposite sides. Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. Someone trying to break through the wall with a single attack must succeed at a Strength check [DC 15 + caster level]. Even when the ice has been broken, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it [including the one who broke through the wall] takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level. Ice Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere with a maximum radius of 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. It is as hard to break through as the ice plane form, but those who go through a breach suffer no damage. You can create a hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though they can avoid being trapped inside by making successful Reflex saves. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: Only the ice plane option is available in this version of the spell, and it measures only 1 inch thick per two caster levels. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The ice inflicts 1d6 points of cold damage anytime it is touched or struck.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wall of Iron ~ MP.MOD				DESC:The character causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material, if its area is sufficient to do so. You cannot conjure the wall to occupy the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space. The wall of iron measures 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically, but it is so hard that it ignores the first 10 points of damage from each blow. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. Someone trying to break through the wall with a single attack must succeed at a Strength check [DC 25 + 2 per inch of thickness]. You can choose to create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50 percent likely to tip in either direction if no one pushes it. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must succeed at a Strength check [DC 40] to push the wall over. Those with room to flee the falling wall may do so with successful Reflex saves. Large and smaller creatures who fail take 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures. Like any iron wall, this one is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The wall can measure no more than 2 inches thick. It must be attached to a surface [thus it cannot be tipped over]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The wall measures 1 inch thick per two caster levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wall of Stone ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. The wall of stone, measuring 1 inch thick per four caster levels, is composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. You cannot conjure the wall to occupy the same space as a creature or another object. You can create a wall of stone in almost any desired shape. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. You can use it to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. You can crudely shape the wall to allow for crenellations, battlements, and so forth [to offer cover] by likewise reducing the area. Each 5-foot square has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically, but the wall is so hard that it ignores the first 8 points of damage from each blow. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. Someone trying to break through the wall with a single attack must succeed at a Strength check [DC 20 + 2 per inch of thickness]. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The wall must be created vertically, and it can be no more than 2 inches thick. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: When a section of the wall is breached, it explodes, spraying bits of stone in a 20-foot cone toward the force that caused the breach. The explosion inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d6].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wall of Thorns ~ MP.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through the wall of thorns takes 25 points of damage per round of movement -1 point for each point of the creature's Armor Class. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to Armor Class do not count for this calculation, but Dexterity penalties do. [Creatures with AC 25 or higher take no damage from contact with the wall.] You can make the wall as little as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape it into a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice the caster level. This has no effect on the damage inflicted by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through can force its way through the barrier in less time. Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall. To make any progress, a creature must succeed at a Strength check [DC 20]. A successful creature moves a number of feet that round equal to its Strength check result -19. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns inflicts damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless to avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and was caught inside. In order to escape, it must push its way free or wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at their normal speed without taking damage. Slow, careful work with edged weapons can breach a wall of thorns. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes. Creatures within the wall suffer damage if they take actions requiring movement [like making attacks]. All creatures in the wall are considered to have half cover. Creatures can see through the wall enough to allow line of sight. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: A creature moving through the wall suffers only 15 points of damage per round [minus Armor Class]. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The thorns become like iron. Use the description [and size] for the wall of iron spell, above, except that anyone touching the wall suffers 1d6 points of damage from the iron thorns. The spell's duration remains 10 minutes/level [D].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Water Breathing ~ MP.MOD			DESC:The transmuted creatures all have seagreen eyes and can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects only you, and the duration becomes one hour per level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: Those whom this version of the spell affects do not need to breathe at all. They also become immune to poison gases or inhaled contaminants or dangers.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Water Roil ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You cause the water around you to roil. Creatures in the water find themselves tossed about. All creatures in the water failing their saving throws must spend the next full round keeping themselves afloat. Anyone who does not keep afloat begins to drown. Creatures who can breathe water merely suffer a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and checks during that round. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The spell affects water around one swimming creature in range. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell also inflicts 1d6 points of water damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d6] to all creatures in the water in range, although succeeding at the Reflex saving throw negates all damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Weary Touch ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a touch attack, you exhaust one creature. An exhausted character moves at half speed and takes a -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After one hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted again by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue. A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After eight hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued. Characters who make a successful saving throw become only fatigued, and only for one hour. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The creature touched becomes fatigued rather than exhausted. A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: A creature with fewer Hit Dice than you that fails its saving throw falls unconscious for 1 round per four caster levels and cannot be revived by nonmagical means. Afterward, the creature remains exhausted.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Whisper of Madness ~ MP.MOD			DESC:You create a swirling wind filled with maddening whispers. A target you select [no attack roll needed] suffers 1d8 points of damage + 2 points of temporary Wisdom damage + 1 point of Wisdom damage per five caster levels. Hit point damage inflicted is half air and half sonic. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The target suffers 1d8 points of damage and 1 point of temporary Wisdom damage. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The target is stunned for 1 round per five caster levels as well as the other effects.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wicked Barb ~ MP.MOD				DESC:With a distinctive gesture, you create and hurl a barbed thorn about 1 foot long like a weapon. This requires a normal ranged attack roll. If successful, the barb inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. Further, the barb itself throbs and pulses once it sticks into the flesh of a creature, inflicting its damage each round it remains stuck in the target, up to 1 round per three caster levels. If the target spends a full-round action, it can remove the barb and suffer no harm that round. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The barb inflicts only 1d6 points of damage with no bonus based on caster level. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The barb inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level [maximum 10d6] on the first round, and 1d6 points of piercing damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on subsequent rounds.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wind Churn ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You cause the air around and above you to churn. While creatures on the ground merely feel a breeze, the chaotic winds buffet those in the air. All flying creatures who fail the saving throw must either land or spend the next full round keeping themselves righted. If a flying creature does neither, it falls. Creatures flying magically do not fall but merely suffer a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and checks during that round. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: This version of the spell affects one flying creature in range. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: The spell also inflicts 1d6 points of air damage per two caster levels [maximum 5d6] to all flying creatures in range, although the Reflex saving throw negates all damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wolf Form ~ MP.MOD				DESC:You change yourself into a wolf. Your type changes to animal. Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night [though this healing does not restore temporary ability score damage or provide other benefits of resting; changing back does not heal you further]. If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead. You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a wolf but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves, and hit points, but gain the wolf 's bite damage, Armor Class, speed, trip attack, low-light vision, and scent. You retain your own skills and feats, and gain the wolf 's feats and racial bonuses to skills [but not its skill ranks]. Equipment worn is subsumed into the wolf 's form, but it is nonfunctional. DIMINISHED EFFECTS: The duration becomes 1 round/level. You do not heal when you change form. HEIGHTENED EFFECTS: You change into a dire wolf instead of a normal wolf.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
