Arcana Inscribed ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																							DESC:Casting this spell brings into being a wet, reddish glow at the end of one of your fingers. The energy seems to pool, threatening to drip off if you are not careful. Using this glow as a stylus, you may inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The markings must be simple enough for you to inscribe them in less than a single round. You choose whether the writing will be visible or invisible. A mark made with arcana inscribed enables you to etch your rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. A detect magic spell causes an invisible mark to glow and become visible, though not necessarily understandable. See invisibility, lion's eye, or similar magic likewise allows the user to see invisible writing made with arcana inscribed. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an erase spell. If an arcana inscribed spell is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month. Some societies use this spell to mark criminals, with their sentence ending when the spell eventually fades. Arcana inscribed must be cast on an object prior to casting materia bond on the same object (see page 142 for details). Heightened Effects: The spell allows you 1 round per caster level to write your mark, with no space or word limitation. With enough patience and castings of this spell, you could literally inscribe a book. You can imbed a creature's truename into the writing, making it visible only to that creature or those who also know (and speak) the creature's truename; such a usage carries the truename descriptor.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Dangersense ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:Casting this spell heightens your awareness of certain dangers. You are more likely to detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps (including trapdoor traps), but it does detect certain natural hazards- quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). It does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the snare spell on page 191), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards. 2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard that you closely examine. Each round, you can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Diminished Effects: The range of this version of the spell is only 30 feet. The duration lasts up to one minute per level. Heightened Effects: The spell can penetrate 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, up to one-half inch of lead, or up to 6 feet of wood or dirt. You learn the presence or absence of hazards, as well as the number and location of each in the first round. You learn the general type and trigger for a particular hazard on the second round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Day's Light ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You touch an object, which sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 60 feet beyond that. Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of this magical light. However, this spell will not damage or destroy creatures damaged or destroyed by bright light. If cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Should someone bring the spell effect into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) both are temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Diminished Effects: The spell's light shines brightly only in a 30-foot radius, and it sheds dim light out to 60 feet. Heightened Effects: You can cast the light on any object or creature within Close range (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels). Creatures (or objects held by creatures) are allowed spell resistance and get a Will save to negate the effects.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

A target that fails its Fortitude save is blinded or deafened, as you choose. The effect cannot be dispelled, but spells such as remove curse and words of undoing (page 227) negates the effect. Diminished Effects: The range is reduced to Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two caster levels). The effects of the spell wear off after one minute per caster level (maximum five minutes).

If slain, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead. You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of an eagle but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain your own base attack bonus, base saves and hit points, but gain the eagle's damage, Armor Class, speed, and flying ability.

Entangle ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																									DESC:With words whispered to the local vegetation, you cause grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees to wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in the area (or those who enter the area). Such creatures are held fast and become entangled. A creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a full-round action to make a Strength or Escape Artist check (DC 18). A creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not entangled but moves at only half speed through the area. Each round on your turn, the plants once again attempt to entangle all creatures that have avoided or escaped entanglement. Diminished Effects: The spell's range is only Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels) and it affects just a single 10-foot-square area. Creatures caught within the area are not entangled, but can move at only half speed unless they make a Reflex saving throw (in which case they may move at normal speed). The duration lasts only 1 round. Heightened Effects: The spell has a range of Long (400 feet + 40 feet per level). Its area is a 40-foot-radius burst. Creatures in the area must make a Strength check or Escape Artist check (DC 20) in order to move.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Erase ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																									DESC:As you cast this spell, you bring into being a magical cloth or other cleaning implement. This glowing, floating form removes writings of either a magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove magical writings of 6th level or lower. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90 percent. You must touch magical writing or a rune to erase it, and also succeed on a caster power check (DC 10 + the writer's level). The runes created by a runethane are slightly more difficult to eliminate than those created by a spell (DC 15 + the runethane's level). A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase magical writing, you accidentally activate that writing instead (if it has such an effect). Diminished Effects: You can erase only your own writing or runes. Heightened Effects: You can erase nonmagical writings automatically. If erasing magical writings, a natural 2 is no longer considered a failure. Finally, you can target one page per caster level or one scroll per two caster levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

This space resembles a bag of holding in most ways. If this spell ends with objects stored, they fall to the ground at your feet. Although some say the spell gains its name from the fact that you could store a pixie in the space, it actually comes from the fact that it was created by a fey caster. Diminished Effects: The extradimensional space can store only one object weighing no more than 1 lb.

Any creature in the area of the fire fan takes 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4). Flammable materials burn if the flames touch them. A character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action. Diminished Effects: The fire deals only 1d4 points of fire damage in a 10-foot cone. Heightened Effects: The range increases to 20 feet, and the force from the cone of flame is tremendous. Creatures that fail their saves against the fire fan are shaken during their next action.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Flaming Sphere ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:When you cast this spell, motes of fire swirl away from your body to form a burning globe. The globe rolls in whichever direction you point, burning those it strikes. The globe moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. The globe rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would. The globe does not move unless you direct it as a moveequivalent action. If left undirected, it merely stays at rest and burns. One can extinguish the flaming sphere by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and causes no damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures, nor can it batter down large obstacles. The globe winks out in a harmless burst of sparks if it exceeds the spell's range. Diminished Effects: The spell has a maximum range of Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels) and causes 1d8 points of fire damage to any creature that it touches. This version of the spell lasts only 1 round plus 1 round for every two caster levels. Heightened Effects: The flaming sphere's radius increases to 10 feet. The globe becomes strong enough to knock over creatures, and as a full-round action, you may direct it to attempt a bull rush. Treat the globe as a Large creature with a Strength bonus equal to your spellcasting key ability score modifier. If the globe moves at least 10 feet, it is treated as charging (+2 modifier). If it loses the opposed Strength check, it still enters its opponent's space. This version of the spell deals 3d6 points of fire damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Form of the Master (Lesser) ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																					DESC:The target of this spell is surrounded by an earthy smell and a cocoon of green light as it rapidly grows, doubling its height and multiplying its weight eightfold. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a -1 penalty on attack rolls and Armor Class due to its increased size. A Medium creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet (face of 5 ? 5 feet) and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. Form of the master similarly enlarges all equipment a creature wears or carries. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected. Any item that leaves the possession of an enlarged creature (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of items do not increase via this spell. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack. Diminished Effects: You must know your target's truename to cast this version of the spell, which takes on the truename descriptor. The spell lasts but 1 round per caster level. Heightened Effects: The casting time is reduced to a standard action. Further, you may cast this spell on a target within Medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level). It does not need to be of your same type.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Harassing Weapon ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																							DESC:A melee weapon of pure force springs into existence and attacks a designated opponent when he provokes attacks of opportunity, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit with a critical threat range of 19-20/?2. The weapon is visible and takes the shape of any normal-sized simple or martial weapon you desire. It uses your base attack bonus as its own. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal creatures. The weapon follows the foe you choose as long as he remains within range. Occupying the same square as the foe, it makes attacks of opportunity whenever that particular foe provokes them, but otherwise it takes no actions. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell's range, the spell ends. Once you've designated a foe, you cannot choose a new opponent to harass with this spell. The harassing weapon cannot be attacked or damaged. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, check for resistance the first time the harassing weapon strikes it. Successfully resisting the weapon dispels the spell. Otherwise, the weapon retains its normal full effect for the duration. Diminished Effects: Duration becomes 1 round. Heightened Effects: The weapon attacks once per round in addition to making attacks of opportunity.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Heat Metal ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:Your features take on a distinctive reddish glow as you cast this spell. Upon completion, the target metal is enveloped in tiny wisps of magical flame. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw (unless its own is higher). A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage, as shown on the table below. Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-forpoint basis. If cast underwater, heat metal deals half damage and boils the surrounding water. The magical flames will not set flammable objects on fire. Heat metal counters and dispels hoarfrost (see page 116). Diminished Effects: The range of the spell becomes Touch. Heightened Effects: The spell lasts 9 rounds and deals damage as follows.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Hoarfrost ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:SPELLRES:Yes (object) Your features take on a slightly blue tinge as you cast this spell. Upon completion, the target equipment becomes covered in a fine layer of frost. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Enchanted metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw (unless its own is higher). A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table below) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight. On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage (this is also the effect on the last round of the spell's duration). During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown below. Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-forpoint basis. Underwater, hoarfrost deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant. Hoarfrost counters and dispels heat metal (see page 114). Diminished Effects: The spell's range becomes Touch. Heightened Effects: The spell lasts 9 rounds and deals damage as follows. Further, a creature holding or wearing an object while it is freezing cold suffers 1 point of Strength damage (regardless of how many rounds the object is worn or held).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Roll separately for each ability. This penalty can't reduce any of these scores below 1. This spell's effect may make it impossible for the target to cast some or all of its spells, if its requisite ability score drops below the minimum required to cast spells of that level. Diminished Effects: The spell reduces the target's Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma by 1d3-1 points each. The duration lasts one minute per level.

They also possess the ability to cast from the palm of the hand a stream of water, which requires a normal ranged attack roll and inflicts 5d6 points of damage to a target it hits within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level). Using this stream of water ability is a standard action that immediately dismisses the lesser mark of water. Special: Subjects may not bear more than one mark from any mark spell at once. Diminished Effects: The mark has no power except when activated (casting the stream) and inflicts only 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4). Heightened Effects: The enhancement bonus is +4.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Master's Reduction (Lesser) ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																					DESC:You encase your target in a cocoon of yellow light with an earthy smell. This spell causes instant diminution of an animal, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a -2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and Armor Class due to its reduced size. Note that as equipment changes, melee and projectile weapons also deal less damage. Any reduced item that leaves a reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). A Small creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet (face 2-1/2 ? 2-1/2 feet) and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet (face 5 ? 5 feet) and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's speed. A Huge creature is reduced to a space of 10 feet (face 5 ? 5 feet) and a natural reach of 10 feet. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced. The damage from the target animal's natural attacks also will be reduced as follows. Diminished Effects: The duration of this version of the spell lasts only one minute per level. Heightened Effects: You may cast this spell on one nonanimal creature.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Memnock's Frigid Enticement ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																					DESC:The target gains a icy blue aura. Upon casting the spell, you specify an action the target could conceivably complete in 1 round. It cannot be an action that would directly bring obvious physical harm to the target. While the target is under no compulsion to commit the act, it knows that if it does not do so, it will be blasted with cold energy. Each round the target fails to perform the action, it suffers 1d4 points of cold damage. The ice mage Memnock created this compulsion that was not an enchantment so it wouldn't rely on the target's force of will. Diminished Effects: The spell inflicts damage once only. Heightened Effects: The spell inflicts 1d8 points of cold damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Minor Lasting Image ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																							DESC:You create a very small, immobile illusion of any object, force, or creature you visualize. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature, nor does it move. The resulting illusion matches your visualization exactly, even if the image in your mind differs somehow from the real object, force, or creature-if such exists at all.

Mirror Image ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You summon several illusory duplicates of yourself, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck. You create 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster surrounding you. You move into and through them. All the images stay within 5 feet of you. When you and the mirror images separate, observers can't use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which is an image. The figments may also move through each other as they mimic your actions. Enemies attempting to attack you (or cast targeted spells at you) must select from among indistinguishable targets. This is represented by rolling randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against a figment destroys it. A figment's Armor Class is 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells. The images are constantly shuffling and merging, so that attacking is virtually the only way of learning which is real and which are false. An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or if an attacker shuts its eyes, the spell has no effect, though being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded. Diminished Effects: You create 1d4 illusory duplicates, which last only 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: You create 2d4 duplicates plus one duplicate per caster level [to a maximum of 12 images].|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

The warded creature gains damage reduction 10/magic (or 10/+1) against ranged weapons.

Diminished Effects: The spell lasts 10 minutes per level and grants DR 5/magic (or 5/+1) against ranged weapons. Once the spell has prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25 points), it is discharged. Heightened Effects: Missile weapons cannot score critical hits against a creature warded by this spell.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Oathlands ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You infuse an area with either positive energy or negative energy. The area chosen has a slight glow to it-white if positive energy was chosen, black if negative energy was chosen. Positive Energy: All undead must make a Will save upon entering the area. Failure means they must leave the area for 1d6 rounds. Undead that make their save suffer minor disruption, giving them a -1 morale penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into the area. Negative Energy: All undead in the area become stronger, gaining a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The energies increase undead creatures' perceptions as well, giving them a +2 enhancement bonus on Listen and Spot checks. If the area contains a permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or ethos, the morale-based modifiers listed above increase to +2 or -2. A positive energy casting of this spell counters and dispels a negative energy casting of it. Diminished Effects: The duration is reduced to 1 round per level. Only the closest 1d12 undead creatures become affected. Heightened Effects: The effect lasts one day per caster level, and all morale modifiers increase to +2 or -2 (+3 or -3 if the area has a permanent fixture). As well, undead in a positive energy area take a -1 penalty to their Armor Class. Undead in a negative energy area gain a +1 deflection bonus to their Armor Class.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Play the Fool ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:The target fools someone who cast a spell upon her-if she makes her saving throw, the caster instead believes she failed it. Thus, she could convince an opposing spellcaster attempting to charm her that the spell succeeded, or that an answer she gives to a lesser or greater compelling question is the truth when it is a lie. Diminished Effects: The spell affects one target only.

Prestidigitation ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																							DESC:Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for one hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. The spell can slowly lift 1 lb. of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 lb. of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell foci. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only for one hour. Heightened Effects: The spell allows you to perform feats of legerdemain and sleight of hand (pulling a small rabbit or dove out of your hat, for example, or producing a bouquet of flowers from your sleeve). If the spell is used in this way, add your caster level to all Perform checks. Created items vanish when the spell does, although you may make them vanish sooner. You can slowly lift up to 5 lbs. per caster level, but no higher than a single foot above the surface below the item. If this spell is ongoing while you cast other spells, it can alter the way the new spell manifests to an observer. For example, if a spell normally is accompanied by a bright flash of light, you might choose to have the spell accompanied by an explosion of rose petals. This has the effect of doubling the spell level for the purpose of a caster's Spellcraft check to determine what spell you are casting.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Purify Food and Drink ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																						DESC:A healthy green glow surrounds food and drink of your choosing, which becomes suitable for consumption even if it was spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Magically enhanced or harmed food and drink remains unaffected by purify food and drink. Note that one cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 64 lbs. Heightened Effects: Food or drink that was magically made impure can be purified with a successful caster power check (DC 11 + caster level).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Recall Tale ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:Using magic to part the veils of reality, you conjure up knowledge of a story involving the spell's focus. For instance, if you concentrate on a specific magic item while you cast recall tale, you gain a story regarding its creation or history- something that might reveal or hint at its power. If you focus on a person, a tale from his or her past comes to you. You cannot ask specific questions, and a focused subject must be an object, a person, or a location. The tale has a 50 percent chance of being relevant to the concerns at hand. If you are touching the focus when you cast the spell, the chance increases to 75 percent. Relevancy depends on the specific circumstances. If you are trying to determine a magic item's powers, then a relevant tale involves its use or creator's intent. If you are trying to discern the location of a person, a relevant tale might involve something that happened to the character very recently. DMs should note that they have free rein with the tale that the spell provides. Even a relevant tale does not have to give away everything. A character trying to discover the current location of someone hiding in a village by the sea might only learn a tale of the person's encounter with a vendor on the street who mentions fresh seafood, just off the boat. You can cast this spell only once per day on a given focus. Diminished Effects: The tale has only a 25 percent chance of being relevant, 50 percent if you are touching the focus. Heightened Effects: The tale has a 75 percent chance of being relevant, 100 percent if you are touching the focus.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Safe Search ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You can thoroughly search an object or area (within the limits of the spell's duration) without fear of personal harm. While searching an area slowly and carefully, you will not set off traps, although other actions-such as stepping on a pressure plate-may still activate one. Neither will you unleash curses or contract a disease when you perform a search, even of dangerous, trapped, or hazardous substances. However, this spell does not influence whether characters find what they're searching for-they still must succeed at a Search check. Diminished Effects: Duration becomes 1 round.

Sample ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																									DESC:You gather a small bit of some hazardous or potentially hazardous substance and magically place it within a crystal flask; casting the spell transports the sample into the flask instantly. Sample protects you from harm in the process. You don't even have to physically touch the substance. This spell allows you to safely handle and store, for instance, poison from a slassan venom sac, a small amount of acid found in an ancient vat, or a tiny piece of a disease-ridden robe. Heightened Effects: You gather 1 ounce per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Scrytalk ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																									DESC:Once you have successfully found a subject with a scrying spell or a device such as a crystal ball, this spell allows you to set up a direct verbal communication with that subject, using the magical sensor created by the spell or device as an audio conduit. For the duration, you hear everything the subject says, and the subject hears everything you say. The spell ends if either the duration runs out or the scrying link is broken. Diminished Effects: The duration is 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: The communication is mental, so you and the scried subject do not need to share a common language to communicate. This version of the spell has the psionic descriptor.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Sense Spell (Lesser) ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																							DESC:By concentrating for a full round, you learn if a spell you name at the time you begin casting is currently in effect within range. If it is, you know the distance and direction of that spell. For example, you could name seeming of form to see if any creatures under the effects of that spell are within range. You may name one spell per round. Diminished Effects: You must touch an object or creature and name a spell that might be affecting the subject. For example, you could name charm to see if a person is under the effects of that spell, or you could see whether a door has been magically shut by lesser sealed door. Unwilling targets may attempt Will saves against this effect; spell resistance applies. Heightened Effects: You can try to learn whether anyone within range has the named spell prepared. Such casters may attempt a Will save against this effect; spell resistance applies.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

If the specified spell is in effect within the area, you become aware of it. You gain no other information-you don't know the caster, caster level, remaining duration, or even the number of such spells in the area. Creatures with spells such as disguise self cast upon them willingly gain a saving throw. Spells like unknown foil minor sense spell and thus cannot serve as the specified spell.

Shape Wood ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:A piece of wood of your choosing is bathed in a warm glow. The wood then reforms itself into any shape that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail is out of the spell's scope. There is a 30 percent chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work. This spell adds a +15 competence bonus on Craft checks involving wooden objects. Diminished Effects: The piece of wood cannot be bigger than 1 cubic foot per two caster levels. The competence bonus is only +10. Heightened Effects: Fine detail is possible, although it will look unusual to an observer, as it has not been traditionally worked. There is only a 10 percent chance that a shape including moving parts will not work. The competence bonus increases to +20.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Shrapnel Globe ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You create a small metal sphere that exists for no longer than the duration. At any point during the duration, if you hurl or drop the globe, it detonates, spraying metal shards in all directions within a 20-foot radius. The shrapnel inflicts 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels, to a maximum of 5d6. Throwing or dropping the sphere where you want requires a standard action, resolved as a grenadelike missile attack. You can give the globe to another creature to use, but it requires a standard action to do so. Diminished Effects: The spell inflicts 1d4 points of damage per two levels (maximum 5d4). Heightened Effects: The explosion has the area of a 40- foot-radius sphere.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Silent Sound ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You fire from your fingertip a focused beam (i.e., a ray) of sonic energy too shrill to hear. To do so, make a ranged touch attack roll. On a hit, you inflict 1d6 points of sonic damage per level (5d6 maximum). Diminished Effects: The spell inflicts 1d4 points of damage per level (maximum 5d4). Heightened Effects: The spell inflicts 1d8 points of damage per level (maximum 5d8).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Song of Sleep ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:In order to cast this spell, you must create a pleasing, relaxing melody. Any creature within the area that fails a Will save becomes drowsy and inattentive, taking a -5 penalty on Listen and Spot checks and a -2 penalty on Will saves against sleep effects while this spell remains in effect. If the creature is not of the same type as you (humanoid, giant, and so on), it receives a +2 bonus on its saving throw. The spell lasts for as long as you concentrate, plus up to 1 round per caster level thereafter. Heightened Effects: The spell's area increases to a 20- foot-radius burst. Further, the subjects also suffer a -5 penalty on Knowledge and Sense Motive checks.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Soul Weapon ~ ST					OUTPUTNAME:Soul Weapon				CLASSES:Complex,Magister=2			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force|Soul								CASTTIME:Standard action	RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:Magic weapon of force																												DURATION:1 round/level (D)											SAVEINFO:None												SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.195	DESC:Weapon's threat range and critical  multipliers increase.|PREVAREQ:DisplayFullSpell,0
Soul Weapon ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You focus your concentration on your oath, belief, or convictions in order to summon a melee weapon made of pure force. This weapon attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 points of force damage +1 point per three caster levels on a successful hit. The soul weapon takes the shape of a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you. Its threat range and critical multipliers depend on your caster level. The soul weapon strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your spellcasting key ability modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so that it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can redirect the weapon to a new target (a move-equivalent action). If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking the same target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to do so. A soul weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but spells that dispel or destroy force effects affect it normally. The weapon's Armor Class against touch attacks is 12 (including a +2 deflection bonus). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster power check against that spell resistance the first time the soul weapon strikes it. If the creature successfully resists the weapon, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration. Diminished Effects: The spell lasts for 1 round per two levels. The weapon deals 1d4+1 points of damage per hit. Its threat range is always 20 and its critical modifier is always ?2. Heightened Effects: The weapon is especially effective. It deals 1d12 points of damage +1 per three caster levels. You select one element associated with your beliefs (or fire if you have no such associated element). On a confirmed critical, the weapon deals an additional 2d6 points of the chosen type of elemental damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Sound Burst ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You create a loud noise by shouting, clapping your hands, and so on. This noise blasts an area with a tremendous cacophony. Every creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. Creatures that cannot hear are not stunned but are still damaged. Diminished Effects: The spell deals only 1d6 points of damage. Creatures that fail their Fortitude saves are merely shaken for 1 round. Heightened Effects: The spell deals 1d12 points of damage. Creatures that fail their Fortitude saves are also deafened for 1d3 days.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Spectral Hand ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You dilute your life essence ever so slightly, creating a ghostly, glowing hand that appears anywhere you can see within range. The hand is an extension of yourself, allowing you to deliver low-level Touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled). You do not regain the hit points if the hand is destroyed, but the damage can be healed as normal. For as long as the spell lasts, any Touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if the hand goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your sight, it returns to you and hovers. The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an Armor Class of at least 22. Your spellcasting key ability modifier applies to the hand's Armor Class as if it were the hand's Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it. Diminished Effects: The spell lasts 1 round per level and has a range of Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two caster levels). The hand requires more of your energy to create, and summoning it deals 1d6 points of damage to you. Heightened Effects: The range increases to Long (400 feet + 40 feet per level). The hand also has a shimmering field of magical energy surrounding it, granting it a +2 deflection bonus to its Armor Class (at least 24). Finally, the hand is nimble, giving you a +3 bonus on your melee touch attack roll.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

Tree Shape ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:By means of this spell, you can assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. Your body is bathed in a brown and green glow as it reforms itself. Once the casting is complete, even the closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually you, magically concealed. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to Armor Class but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you. You can dismiss tree shape as a free action. Diminished Effects: The duration lasts only one minute per caster level.

Unseen Servant ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																								DESC:You create a servant to perform tasks for you. The servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 lbs. or drag 100 lbs.). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 lbs. of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a Difficulty Class higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet. The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it suffers 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist. Diminished Effects: This version of the spell lasts only a single minute, and the servant's speed is 10 feet.

Vermin Infestation ~ ST.MOD																																																																																																																							DESC:As you cast this spell, you cause a black cloud to appear in the air within range. The cloud swirls faster and faster, opening a rip in the air through which floods a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice). The swarm attacks all other creatures within its area, and may be summoned so that it shares the area of other creatures. If no living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. You have no control over its target or direction of travel. See the MM for details on swarms. Diminished Effects: The summoned swarm is more of a distraction than anything else. Creatures inside the swarm take no damage but suffer a -1 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on Concentration checks. Heightened Effects: The swarm has maximum hit points and lasts for 1d6+2 rounds after you are done concentrating on the spell.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

It causes a magical band of force to wrap around the creature's neck (or similar body part) and extends a 10-foot, ropelike end to your hand so you can lead the creature. A subject under the effects of a yoke must move as you do, at your speed, even if unconscious, held, incapacitated, or bound. The spell even forces limbs to move, overriding other magic-like margul (dreaded freeze; see page 135)-and even causing rope or other bindings to lengthen enough to move. However, this effect offers the subject no special chance to escape. A creature affected by the yoke spell but no longer helpless or dominated must oppose the yoke's +12 "grapple" to get free, either with a grapple check or an Escape Artist check. The yoke has the subject effectively pinned, so to get free, the affected creature must succeed at two opposed checks. If the yoked creature gets partially but not entirely free (succeeds at one check but not both), you can use a standard action to attempt to pin it once again with the yoke at no risk of being grappled yourself. Under no circumstances can the yoke inflict damage. The yoke has 25 hit points and a hardness of 2. If the creature escapes, or should the yoke be destroyed, the spell ends. Diminished Effects: The yoke has a +8 grapple, 10 hit points, and no hardness. Heightened Effects: The yoke has a +16 grapple, 50 hit points, and a hardness of 4.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1

# Spell Name				Description
Acid Splash ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Upon casting this spell, you conjure a silvery-blue orb of acid above the palm of your hand. It instantaneously streaks toward your designated target. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit. Upon striking the target, the orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage. Heightened Effects: The orb takes on a blackish-blue sheen. You may chose to hold it for up to 1 round before selecting a target as a free action. If you do not choose a target after 1 round, you take 1d3 points of acid damage and the orb vanishes. If it hits its target, the orb deals 1d4 points of acid damage. As well, the target must make a Reflex save or suffer 1 point of Strength damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Aid ~ ST.MOD				DESC:A soft white light briefly enshrouds your target as you complete the casting of this spell. For the duration, your target's eyes (if any) retain a slight glow. Your target gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your caster level (maximum 1d8+10). Diminished Effects: The duration is only 1 round per level. Additionally, the target gains temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum 1d4+5). Heightened Effects: The range becomes Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels). Additionally, the target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity (your choice).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Animal Messenger ~ ST.MOD		DESC:As a standard action, you can summon a Tiny animal to appear before you, bathed in a green glow that quickly fades. The animal must be within range in order to be summoned, but you may select the type of animal you are hoping to have appear (such as a sparrow or a mouse). If the specified type is unavailable, any other viable animal within range may answer your call. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including an animal companion. When the animal appears, you may mentally impress upon it a certain place well known to you, or an obvious landmark. The animal allows you to tie a small item or note to it, and then it departs for the named location. Your directions for getting to the location must be simple, as the animal relies on your personal knowledge and not its own. The animal goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities. It travels at its own speed, so if the journey is too far or too arduous, it will be unable to complete the trip. If attacked by anything, the messenger abandons its mission and flees. The animal will not perform any other tricks for you. Once it arrives, the animal messenger will wait for your intended recipient to appear. During this period of waiting, the messenger will allow anyone to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or she doesn't know, for example). Diminished Effects: The duration of the spell becomes only one hour per caster level. This version of the spell is most often employed by spell users to send notes to their apprentices or to locals to ask a favor. Heightened Effects: The range becomes Medium (100 feet + 10 feet per level) and the animal that appears can be Small or Tiny. The duration increases to one week plus one day per level. Finally, the animal's base speed is increased by one-half and it receives the benefit of the scent bane spell. This makes it more likely to reach its destination without being disturbed by predators.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Animate Rope ~ ST.MOD			DESC:This spell encases a nonliving ropelike object of your choice in a shimmering yellow glow. As the glow fades at the end of casting, the rope begins to move under your spoken command. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50 percent for each additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50 percent for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half. You can give the rope one of 10 possible commands: "coil" (form a neat, coiled stack), "coil and knot," "loop," "loop and knot," "tie and knot," and the opposites of all of the above ("uncoil," and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move-equivalent action, as if directing an active spell. The rope, while animated, cannot move into squares other than its own. It can, however, wrap around a creature or an object within 1 foot of it-it does not snake outward-so it must either begin near the intended target or be thrown. Throwing requires a successful ranged touch attack (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and can be burst with a Strength check (DC 23). The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to entangle an opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw. A spellcaster bound by the animated rope must make a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with an Escape Artist check (DC 20). This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope. The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical. The spell cannot animate objects that a creature carries or wears. If the distance between you and the rope exceeds the spell's range for any reason, the spell ends and the rope falls still. Diminished Effects: The spell's range is reduced to Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels), and the touch attack to wrap up a creature takes a -2 penalty. Heightened Effects: In this version of the spell, you also can command the rope to "move" and "stop." The rope moves at a speed of 5 feet per round and can slither up trees or bumpy surfaces with a +10 bonus on its Climb check.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Animated Tattoo ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You create a tattoo with the ability to move in place upon a creature's skin. Thus, the spell can create an animated tattoo of a lion roaring or a dragon breathing fire, a moving waterfall, or a warrior swinging a sword. The image and its movements are preset; once the spell is cast, one cannot change them. The image is decorative only, with no other effects. Heightened Effects: The tattoo can move all over the subject's body, if you wish.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Arrow Deflection ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You can deflect one ranged physical (nonspell) attack per round as a free action if you make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20); if the ranged weapon has a magical bonus to attack, the Difficulty Class increases by that amount. Should you succeed, you deflect the weapon. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed, however. Diminished Effects: The spell affects only one attack. Heightened Effects: You can deflect up to three incoming attacks in a round.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Assess Creature ~ ST.MOD		DESC:With a wave of your hand, you determine the Hit Dice of one creature. This spell is foiled by any type of magical disguise, polymorph magic, or shapechanging ability. Heightened Effects: If the target has class levels, you know which class. If the creature has more than one class, you know the class in which it has the most levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bane ~ ST.MOD				DESC:Casting this spell brings an acrid odor to the air. Creatures that can hear may discern a nearly imperceptible laughter as the spell is completed. Bane fills any enemies within the target area with fear and doubt. Each affected creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and a -1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Bane counters and dispels bless. Diminished Effects: This spell affects a single target creature and lasts for only 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: This spell gains the negative energy descriptor and lasts for one hour per level. Additionally, the -1 penalty on saving throws extends to all mind-affecting effects.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bless Relationship ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You put your deity's blessing on a relationship, most likely during a ceremony such as a marriage. Henceforth, the two subjects gain a +1 inherent bonus to Diplomacy checks made in regard to each other. Diminished Effects: N/A Heightened Effects: The bonus is +2.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bless ~ ST.MOD				DESC:Casting this spell brings the smell of freshly blooming lilacs to the air. Creatures that can hear may discern nearly imperceptible harp music. Bless causes any ally (as determined by you) within range to be filled with courage. Each affected ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects. Allies affected by this spell whose truenames you know also gain a +1 morale bonus on all skill checks for the duration of the spell. Bless counters and dispels bane. Diminished Effects: This spell affects only a single target creature within 50 feet, and lasts for only 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: This spell gains the positive energy descriptor and lasts for 10 minutes per level. Additionally, the saving throw bonus extends to all mind-affecting effects.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Blissful Sleep ~ ST.MOD			DESC:The target can get a good night's sleep even in horrible conditions. Even wearing armor, lying on a slimy dungeon floor surrounded by corpses, a character can sleep soundly. This sleep is not a compulsion, however-it affects only willing targets. Characters who sleep for the full duration of this spell wake up so refreshed, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the first skill or ability check they make that day. Characters sleeping under the effects of this spell gain a +4 luck bonus to saving throws against somnamancer class abilities and dream hunter special attacks. Diminished Effects: The target gains no bonus to skill checks. Heightened Effects: The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to all skill or ability checks for one hour upon waking.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Blue Bolt ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You point your finger and from it erupts a thin blue bolt. You must make a ranged touch attack to use the bolt to strike a foe. If it hits, you deal 1d6 points + 1 point per level of subdual damage (maximum +10). This spell has no effect on objects, undead, or constructs. Diminished Effects: The spell inflicts 1d4 points of subdual damage. Heightened Effects: The spell inflicts 1d6 points of subdual damage plus 1d6 additional points per two levels (maximum 5d6).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Bonemask ~ ST.MOD				DESC:A translucent mask of bone is superimposed over your face. All targeted creatures of less than 6 HD become frightened for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that succeed on a Will saving throw instead become shaken for 1 round. Creatures with 6 HD or more are immune to this effect. Diminished Effects: Only creatures of your type (giant, humanoid, and so on) can be affected by this version of the spell. Heightened Effects: The spell takes on the truename descriptor. Targets suffer a -4 penalty on all saving throws. Further, creatures that fail the Will save suffer the loss of 2 points of Wisdom for the duration of the spell.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Calm the Beast ~ ST.MOD			DESC:When casting this spell, your voice becomes more gruff and animalistic. Any targeted creatures (all of which must be the same species) may become docile and harmless. Roll 2d4 + caster level to determine the total number of Hit Dice affected. You gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your Handle Animal ability, and you may make immediate Handle Animal checks (instead of Diplomacy checks) as a free action to calm the animals down (see "Influencing Attitude" in Chapter One of Arcana Evolved). You roll against each animal individually. You can only influence their attitude by up to two steps (hostile to indifferent, for example). Animals trained to attack or guard, dire animals, and magical beasts have a +2 Difficulty Class for purposes of your attempt to influence attitude. Affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures. When the spell effect ends, they regain their prior attitude toward you. Diminished Effects: You receive only a +5 bonus on your Handle Animal checks, and you may influence only a single animal. Heightened Effects: Roll 3d6 + caster level to determine the total number of Hit Dice of creatures affected.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Change Weapon ~ ST.MOD			DESC:This spell alters one weapon, transforming it into another weapon of your choice with the same quality and magical abilities (if any). Change weapon can increase or decrease a weapon's size by up to three categories, so one could transform a dagger into a dire flail but not into a Huge greatsword. For the purposes of this spell, a "weapon" is anything designed specifically for fighting; a dagger or sword counts as a weapon, but a butter knife or a chair leg does not. This spell cannot affect or create siege engines or ranged weapon ammunition (bolts, arrows, and so on). This spell can transform a weapon's ammunition, such as an arrow or a sling stone, into another weapon, such as a melee weapon. However, the ammunition's magical abilities (if any) can be used only once before they are forever lost. Diminished Effects: The weapon's size can change by only one category. Heightened Effects: The spell affects one weapon per caster level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Clarity of Mind ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You call upon the stillness of the universe to grant you mental and emotional peace. You gain a +1 competence bonus to Concentration checks. Heightened Effects: The spell confers a +4 competence bonus to Concentration checks.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Cloud the Mind ~ ST.MOD			DESC:This spell hinders and clouds its target's senses, making the character less likely to notice slight clues that tip off a lie, an opponent skulking in the shadows, or a distant sound. The target suffers a -4 penalty to Listen, Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Diminished Effects: The target suffers a -1 penalty. The duration becomes 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: The duration lasts 10 minutes per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Cluatta ~ ST.MOD				DESC:This spell is named after a litorian word for punishment. You enhance your nonmagical club or quarterstaff to grant it a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. (A quarterstaff gains this enhancement for both ends of the weapon.) It deals an additional 2d4 points of damage on a successful hit. These effects only occur when you wield the weapon. If you do not wield it, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by this spell. Diminished Effects: The duration expires after a single attack, but the staff deals an additional 1d3 points of damage if you hit. Heightened Effects: You may hand the weapon to a different creature to wield, but the magic quickly fades. Each round the weapon is held by someone other than you, it is as if one minute of the spell's normal duration has passed. If you wield the weapon, it deals an additional 1d12 points of damage on a successful hit instead of 2d4 points. If someone else wields the weapon, it only deals an additional 1d4 points of damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Comrade's Trail ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You create a trail, like a glowing thread, visible only to those whom you name while casting the spell. You can name only one creature per level. Nothing can disturb the trail physically, but it can be dispelled, and even 1 point of damage inflicted from a magical source destroys it. You can use this spell to create a visible trail through a maze, through a thick woods, or anywhere you want your friends to follow. Heightened Effects: The duration becomes one day per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Create Water ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Through this spell you create wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large (possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles). Water weighs about 8 lbs. per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly eight gallons and weighs about 60 lbs. Diminished Effects: You create only one-half gallon of water per caster level. Heightened Effects: The water created can appear with force, dousing flames and putting out small fires. An elemental creature with the fire subtype caught in the area of the spell suffers 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6, Reflex save for half damage). An elemental creature of the water subtype caught in the area of the spell enjoys 1d6 points of healing per two caster levels (maximum 5d6).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Crystal Shard ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You create a thin crystal shard that comes out of the tip of your finger and flies in the direction you point, like an arrow. Make a ranged attack roll. If you succeed, the shard inflicts 1d8+2 points of damage. After it strikes its target, the shard turns to powder. Diminished Effects: The spell has a range of 25 feet and inflicts only 1d6 points of damage. Heightened Effects: You gain a +5 enhancement bonus to the attack roll.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Detect Animals or Plants ~ ST.MOD	DESC:You can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you can change it each round. Your skin tones darken as you detect animals, and lighten as you detect plants. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant. This spell only detects creatures of the animal subtype, although it will detect both plants and plant creatures. 1st Round: Presence or absence of that kind of animal or plant in the area. 2nd Round: Number of individuals of the specified kind in the area, and the condition of the healthiest specimen. 3rd Round: The condition (see below) and location of each individual present. If an animal or plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Conditions: For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows: ~ Normal: Has at least 90 percent of full normal hit points, free of disease. Fair: 30 percent to 90 percent of full normal hit points remaining. Poor: Less than 30 percent of full normal hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury. Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease in the terminal stage, or crippled. If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two. Each round you can turn to detect a kind of animal or plant in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Diminished Effects: The range of this spell is Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels). It lasts only one minute per level. Heightened Effects: The spell detects groups of animals or plants of a general type (such as canines, conifers, and so on) as opposed to a specific kind (a wolf or pine tree, for example). Further, the spell can penetrate 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, up to one-half inch of lead, or up to 6 feet of wood or dirt.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Discern Preference ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You learn the subject's preference regarding an issue you specify at the time of casting. For example, if you specified, "What is the king's favorite color?" and then cast the spell, you would learn the king's favorite color so you could prepare a gift to present to him when you are called to court the next day. Likewise, you could specify, "Does Charnoth want to go into the Tower of Terephon?" and learn whether or not he does (although Charnoth still might go there, even if he does not want to). Diminished Effects: You must know the target's truename, and the spell gains the truename descriptor. Heightened Effects: This version of the spell affects up to three targets.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Disrupt Reflexes ~ ST.MOD		DESC:This enchantment hinders the target's reflexes, dulling the character's mind so she reacts slowly to sudden threats. The target suffers a -4 penalty to initiative and a -2 penalty to Reflex saves as this spell disrupts her reaction time. If cast during combat, apply the modifier to the target's current initiative score, but remove it if the spell expires before the end of the encounter. Diminished Effects: The target suffers a -1 penalty to initiative rolls and Reflex saves. The duration lasts 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: The duration becomes 10 minutes per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Disrupt Undead ~ ST.MOD			DESC:A bright white ray shoots from your extended hand. Youmust make a ranged touch attack to hit your target. If the ray hits an undead creature, it deals 1d6 points of damage to it. Heightened Effects: An undead target takes 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels, to a maximum of 5d6.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Dry Rain ~ ST.MOD				DESC:You summon a dark cloud up to 100 feet directly over a point within range. The cloud has a 20-foot radius. It immediately begins raining down sand with great force, slowly burying anyone beneath the cloud. Anyone beneath it suffers 1d6 points of damage each round (a new save is required each round). For each round the dry rain falls, a heap of sand 1 foot high piles up beneath the cloud. Creatures of size Large or smaller who fail their saving throw and remain in the area for as little as part of a round or as much as two consecutive rounds must spend a standard action to pull themselves free of the fallen sand and clear their eyes, mouth, etc. (It takes a move action for them to leave the area, if they want to go and have enough speed.) Even failing one saving throw while in the area for 2 rounds is enough to require this action. Creatures in the area who do not pull themselves free are stuck in place; they make attacks with a -2 penalty and face an effective -4 penalty to Dexterity. Characters attempting to cast a spell in the area do so as if entangled (Concentration check, DC 15 + spell level). Those who pull themselves free of the fallen sand but do not leave the area start getting covered by sand all over again. Should a creature of size Large or smaller spend more than 2 rounds in the area, getting free takes a full-round action and a Strength check (DC 10 + the number of rounds spent in the area). This means a creature that spends 3 rounds in the area and then wants to leave must make a Strength check (DC 13) and spend an entire round getting free. However, since it has used its entire round, it cannot move out of the area until the next round. So if the spell's duration continues, the creature must then spend another standard action next round getting free, then move out. A creature small enough to be completely buried may face suffocation (see Chapter Eight: Glossary in the DMG). You cannot move the cloud once you have created it. Normal weather does not affect the dry rain-even gale-force winds do not move the cloud. Magical weather or a gusting wind spell, however, dispels the cloud automatically. The sand remains even after the duration ends. Diminished Effects: The spell has a maximum duration of 10 rounds and inflicts no damage. Heightened Effects: The spell's area is a cylinder 30 feet in radius and up to 100 feet high. Creatures of size Huge or smaller must spend actions to get free.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Earthen Claw ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You conjure a grasping claw made of earth and stone. It bursts from the ground beneath your target, tearing at him. It has a base attack bonus equal to your total level and a Strength score equal to 16 + your Wisdom modifier. It adds its Strength modifier to its attack and damage as normal. If it strikes the target, it inflicts 2d6 points of slashing damage and may attempt a trip attack against the target. The claw is Small. After making an attack, the claw disappears. The earthen claw cannot flank opponents, nor can it come under attack. It appears just long enough to deliver its attack, then disappears back into the dirt. Diminished Effects: The claw has no Strength modifier. Heightened Effects: The duration becomes 1 round per level, during which the claw can make one attack per round at any creature within reach (but it cannot move).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Endure Elements ~ ST.MOD		DESC:This spell summons a brief swirl of color that rushes into your target's mouth. The target is filled with a calming presence that keeps it appropriately warmed or cooled despite other weather conditions. A creature protected by this spell suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The spell likewise protects the creature's equipment. It does not provide any protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth. Diminished Effects: You must know your target's truename, and the spell takes on the truename descriptor. The spell lasts but a single hour per level (to a maximum of six hours). Heightened Effects: The target receives a +2 morale bonus on saves against spells with an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Faen Fires ~ ST.MOD			DESC:A pale twinkling glow surrounds and outlines your chosen targets, which shed a pale light about as strong as a candle. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though any 2nd-level or higher spell or effect that creates magical darkness suppresses this spell). They also do not benefit from effects or spells of 3rd level or lower that provide concealment. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The light can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The spell does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined. Diminished Effects: The range of the spell is Medium (100 feet + 10 feet per level). The spell affects a single target. Heightened Effects: Targets subject to this spell have any cover bonuses reduced by 1 (so that one-quarter cover would yield a +1 AC bonus instead of +2, nine-tenths cover would yield +9 AC instead of +10, and so on). As well, any concealment miss chance not created by darkness is reduced by 5 percent (so that a light fog would provide only 5 percent concealment, while dense foliage would provide 25 percent).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Faen Glow ~ ST.MOD			DESC:When this spell is cast, it surrounds you with tiny motes of sparkling light. These rush out to form one of the types of light described below. You can choose to create either up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like willo'- wisps; see the MM for details), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The lights must all stay within 10 feet of each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range. Heightened Effects: The number of lights created doubles. Further, the spell's duration increases to one minute per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Faen Motes ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Casting this spell summons thousands of tiny multicolored motes of light that fill an area you select. All creatures and objects in the area are covered by the faen motes, with three effects, as follows. First, creatures that fail a Will save are blinded for the duration of the spell (spell resistance applies against this effect). Second, invisible creatures and objects in the area are outlined for the duration of the spell. Third, all things in the area shed light as if they were a torch. This causes any creature covered by the motes to take a -40 penalty on Sneak checks made to hide. These last two effects allow no save or spell resistance. The motes cannot be removed, and they continue to sparkle until the spell fades Diminished Effects: The spell functions against a single target within Close range (25 feet + 5 feet per two caster levels). Heightened Effects: There is no spell resistance allowed against any of the spell's effects. Even if a creature is not blinded by the lights, it is dazzled (-1 penalty on attack rolls, Search checks, and Spot checks).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Feral Song ~ ST.MOD			DESC:When casting this spell, you begin to chant softly and sing as you sway back and forth. The scent of fresh growing things fills the air, and your voice takes on a soothing aspect. (Instead of singing and chanting, you can instead softly play an instrument such as a flute.) This spell compels animals and magical beasts that can either see or hear you from within the spell's area to do nothing but watch you. Only an animal or magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be fascinated by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected. When the spell ends, affected creatures will mind their own business and leave you undisturbed so long as you take no hostile action against them. A magical beast, a dire animal, or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; an animal not trained to attack or guard is not. Diminished Effects: You may cast this spell only on a single target creature. That animal will attempt to approach within 5 feet of you, moving at one-half normal speed in order to do so. Heightened Effects: As above, but in addition to magical beasts, animals that have received the celestial or fiendish template also can be affected (though they may attempt a saving throw). Further, you are allowed to move slowly about (up to one-half your normal speed), with the animals following you. While the spell remains in effect, you can give the animals a single command of "fall to the ground" or "flee before me" (see the compelling command spell).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Grave Ward ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Your targets (including yourself, if desired) exude a dark red glow that magically prevents undead from seeing, hearing, or smelling them. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the warded creatures. However, if it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature touches an undead creature or attacks any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients. Diminished Effects: You may cast this spell only on yourself. The duration lasts 10 minutes. Heightened Effects: You may cast this spell on creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst centered on your location.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Guilt ~ ST.MOD				DESC:A target creature is forced to think about some evil deed it performed, denying it any actions except to defend itself. Diminished Effects: The duration lasts 1 round in this version of the spell. Heightened Effects: Up to three targets, all within 25 feet of each other, can be affected.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Helm of Warding ~ ST.MOD		DESC:The creature that you touch-if it has a head but is not wearing a helmet, hat, headband, or other headgear-suddenly appears to don a golden helmet of energy. The creature then gains a +5 resistance bonus to all saving throws against mindaffecting spells and powers. Diminished Effects: The resistance bonus is +1. Heightened Effects: The helmet also confers a +2 enhancement bonus to Armor Class.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Honeyed Words ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Your words take on additional persuasive weight. As you speak, this spell alters your statements so they sound as pleasing as possible to each listener. The thrust of your words remains the same-if you asked a group of people to attack one of your rivals, they don't think you wanted them to unload a carriage or perform some other innocent task. However, the spell tailors the request to make it sound appealing to a listener. One person might hear that your rival is a kidnapper, while another one might believe him a member of an evil cult. You gain a +4 competence bonus to all Bluff and Diplomacy checks that involve speaking while this spell lasts. (DMs should use the rules for influencing NPCs to determine the results.) Diminished Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to affected Bluff and Diplomacy checks. Heightened Effects: The duration becomes 10 minutes per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Hunter's Boon ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Casting this spell gives you intuitive insight into searching for things, such as traps. You gain an insight bonus on Search checks equal to one-quarter your caster level, or one-half your caster level if searching for traps. Note that this spell grants no ability to disable any traps that you may find. Diminished Effects: The spell's duration lasts 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: You may cast this version of the spell on a willing creature if you know its truename. The spell takes on the truename descriptor.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Hunter's Walk ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You surround your target with a light brown glow, which fades as the casting concludes. The subject or subjects can move through any type of terrain and leave neither footprints nor scent. Those who attempt to track the targets suffer a -10 penalty on their checks. Diminished Effects: You may cast the spell only on yourself. It lasts for 10 minutes. Heightened Effects: The subjects also gain a +4 insight bonus on Sneak checks.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Ignore ~ ST.MOD				DESC:You magically distract a creature, causing it to suffer a -5 penalty to Spot and Listen checks. Heightened Effect: The duration lasts 1 round per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Inspire Courage ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You inspire courage in your allies, bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. Once the spell has been cast, you can sing as a free action each round. While singing, you can take any action other than casting spells, activating magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activating magic items by magic word (such as wands). To be affected, an ally must hear you sing for a full round, so the effect begins the round after you use this spell. The effect lasts as long as you sing and for 5 rounds after the singing stops (or the ally can no longer hear it). Affected allies receive a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus to attack and weapon damage rolls. Diminished Effects: The bonus lasts no more than 1 round, no matter what you do. Heightened Effects: The +1 morale bonus also applies to saving throws and skill checks.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Instill Music ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You put a song of your choosing into another creature's mind. For the duration, the song runs through the creature's head, unbidden. The spell does not compel the creature to enjoy it, but it cannot have any special helpful or adverse effects, either (it could not be a harpy's song, for example). It must be a song you can sing or play. Diminished Effects: The duration lasts 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: The duration is one hour per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Jump ~ ST.MOD				DESC:This spell may have been developed by the sibeccai after encountering the faen spell acrobatics. This spell is similar, but much more specific, granting your target a +10 enhancement bonus on Jump checks. The enhancement bonus increases to +20 at caster level 5th, and to +30 (the maximum) at caster level 9th. Diminished Effects: The subject receives a +5 enhancement bonus on Jump checks. Heightened Effects: The subject receives a +15 enhancement bonus on Jump checks. This bonus increases to +25 at caster level 5th, +35 at caster level 10th, and +5 per five caster levels above 10th.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Keep Dry ~ ST.MOD				DESC:You magically protect one object from getting wet. Even if submerged underwater, the object remains dry. Objects that normally would absorb water (cloth, paper, a sponge) under the influence of this spell do not. Characters often cast this spell to protect their papers or scrolls when in damp areas. Heightened Effects: You can affect one object per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Keep Fresh ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Food under the effect of this spell does not spoil, rot, or decay in any way. It doesn't even change temperature (hot food stays hot, cold food stays cold). It remains as fresh at the end of the duration as it was at the beginning. Heightened Effects: You can affect 1 lb. per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Know Talent ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You learn which skill the target has the most ranks in, if any. Alternatively, if cast on a child, you know what the child's highest ability score will be and which class and skills he may excel at. This spell does not predict the future, however- learning what a child is best at is not always an indicator of what he will actually do. Heightened Effects: You also learn one random feat that the target has, and one spell (if any) that he currently has readied.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Learn Heritage ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You learn details of the family and ancestry of a chosen target. You learn the race of the target as well as detecting the presence of any other unusual elements (dragon blood, for example). You also can mentally check for one specific bloodline (blood of the Tairevel family, for example) and get a yes/no indication. To check for more than one bloodline, you must cast the spell multiple times. Heightened Effects: You can check for one bloodline per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Light as a Feather ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You negate the armor check penalty for your armor and shield. This spell cannot be made permanent. Heightened Effect: The spell's duration becomes one minute per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Long Flame ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You take one lit candle, torch, or lantern and increase the amount of time it will burn without consuming additional fuel or wick by a factor of 1 plus your level. Thus, a 1st-level caster increases the amount of time a torch lasts-usually an hour-by two (thus, three hours). Heightened Effects: The flame continues to burn indefinitely (but can be put out normally, ending the spell).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Magic Ward ~ ST.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like magic circle, except there is no radius to the spell (it affects only the target creature) and you cannot focus the spell inward. Diminished Effects: The spell lasts but 1 round. You may cast it only on yourself. Heightened Effects: The spell can be cast on a target creature within 30 feet.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Magical Performance ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You gain a +5 circumstance bonus to Perform checks. This bonus applies only to checks made while attempting normal Perform checks, not for checks that have to do with feat or item activation. Diminished Effects: The circumstance bonus is +1. Heightened Effects: The spell affects you and one other performer per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Mental Alarm ~ ST.MOD			DESC:All subjects are mentally alerted simultaneously at some predesignated moment. The moment is chosen by you and must be within the duration of the spell. Small groups often use this spell to coordinate actions. Heightened Effects: The duration lasts one day per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Minor Ward ~ ST.MOD			DESC:This inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A minor ward can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature of a specific type violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores. Wards can be set according to creature type, subtype, or species (such as "sibeccai" or "aberration"). Wards also can be set to pass those of your religion or organization. They cannot be set according to appearance, class, Hit Dice, or level. Wards respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple minor wards cannot function within 30 feet of each other. When casting the spell, you mark a clear design in paint, chalk, blood, scratch marks, or some other means. The ward can conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the ward remains quite obvious. Wards cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. The unknown spell can fool a minor ward. Read magic allows you to identify a minor ward with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 13). Identifying the minor ward does not discharge it, but it allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version [see below], type of damage caused, what spell is stored). Depending on the version selected, a minor ward either blasts the intruder or activates a spell: Blast Ward: A blast deals 1d4 points of damage to one target. This damage is acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (your choice, made at time of casting). Those affected can make Reflex saves to take half damage. Spell Ward: You can store any harmful 0-level spell that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your level at the time of casting. If the spell has targets, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect (such as a cloud), the area or effect centers on the intruder. All saves operate as normal, except that the Difficulty Class is based on the level of the minor ward. Heightened Effects: The blast ward inflicts 2d4 points of damage. The spell ward is any harmful 1st-level spell you know.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Miracle Mount ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You summon a creature of 3 Hit Dice or less to serve you as a mount. The creature must be one normally used for riding, and serves willingly and well. The mount comes with an appropriate bit, bridle, and riding saddle. Diminished Effects: The mount lasts only 10 minutes. Heightened Effects: The mount appears with maximum hit points.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Mist Bank ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Upon completing the casting of this spell, a bank of blue mist forms at a point you designate. The mists swirl with strange movements from an unfelt wind. These mists obscure all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks have a 20 percent miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50 percent miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the mist in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater. Diminished Effects: The mist has much less volume, spreading in a 10-foot radius, 10 feet high. Further, the spell's range is reduced to Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels). Heightened Effects: The mist spreads in a 40-foot radius, 20 feet high. You can shape this volume as desired as long as no part of the mist extends more than 40 feet past your maximum range. This can prove very useful for putting up a long, thin wall to obscure troops (or make the enemy think you are obscuring troops), or even to make a recognizable shape (such as an arrow pointing out something of note to someone flying overhead).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Mojh Eye ~ ST.MOD				DESC:Your eyes become more snakelike in appearance, and a twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors appears to emanate from them in a hypnotic spiral. This pattern swirls out to fascinate creatures caught within the twisting lights. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of Hit Dice of creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first; among creatures with equal Hit Dice, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures go unaffected. Diminished Effects: The spell affects only 2d4 Hit Dice of creatures. Heightened Effects: The range of the spell increases to Medium (100 feet + 10 feet per level).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Monkey Climb ~ ST.MOD			DESC:By increasing your finger length, strength, and agility, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to one Climb check made during the duration. This spell cannot be made permanent. Heightened Effect: The spell affects all Climb checks made during the duration, the range becomes Touch, and the target is one creature.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Nimbus of Health ~ ST.MOD		DESC:When you cast this spell, you tap into the life energies present nearby. This energy swirls around you in a cloud of white light, which dissipates as you complete the spell. While nimbus of health is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10). Diminished Effects: You gain only 1d10 temporary hit points, which last for 10 minutes per level (to a maximum of 60 minutes). Heightened Effects: You gain 1d12 + 3 hit points per two caster levels (to a maximum of +15). These last for 24 hours. As well, the burst of life energies grants you a +1 enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus. This bonus fades when the temporary hit points have been expended.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Oath of Speed ~ ST.MOD			DESC:By concentrating on a deeply held view or an oath you have taken, you summon a reserve of magical energy that increases your base land speed by 30 feet. Treat this adjustment as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Jump skill in Chapter Four of Arcana Evolved). Diminished Effects: The spell's duration lasts only 1 round. Heightened Effects: You may cast this version of the spell on a willing target that you touch. Alternatively, if you cast this spell on yourself, it lasts 10 minutes plus one minute per caster level, and your base land speed increases by 45 feet.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Pattern of Sibyllic Fate ~ ST.MOD	DESC:You learn the basic fortune of a creature as a symbol appears over its head that only you can see. If you see a glowing halo, you know that the person has general good (or at least average) fortune ahead and likely will live out a fairly normal lifespan (the creature will not die in the next few months at minimum). If you see a death's head symbol, you know the person has some hideous fortune ahead or soon will die. If you see a shifting orb of multicolored light, you know that the creature is in a state of flux; it is impossible to determine the pattern of fate at this time. There is a chance of 70 percent + 1 percent per caster level that you will see a pattern; you never see an incorrect pattern with this spell, but you might see nothing. You can only try to view a creature's fate pattern once per casting of the spell. Casting this spell on a character who frequently heads into danger but is fairly capable (like an adventurer) likely generates a flux result each time. You can never view your own pattern of sibyllic fate. Diminished Effects: The spell has only a 50 percent chance to reveal a pattern. Heightened Effects: This version of the spell always reveals a pattern.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Peace ~ ST.MOD				DESC:Your voice becomes calm and soothing as you cast this spell. Agitated creatures within range find themselves relaxed and unwilling to engage in hostile activity. They will immediately stop fighting and cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or life-threatening damage dealt to an affected creature immediately breaks the spell on all affected creatures. This spell will suppress (but not dispel) mind-affecting spells and abilities, as well as morale spells and effects (such as a champion's heartening cry). This requires a successful caster power check (opposed by the caster of the other spell). While the peace spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When this spell ends, the suppressed spell or effect continues, provided its duration has not expired in the meantime. Diminished Effects: The range is reduced to Close (25 feet + 5 feet per two levels). You may target only a single creature. Heightened Effects: In addition to the above effects, creatures that fail their saving throw enter such a tranquilstate that they may not be fully aware of their surroundings. Such creatures take a -2 penalty to Wisdom checks and Wisdom-based skill checks, and a -1 penalty to Will saves. Because this state of tranquility very closely resembles a state of drowsiness, creatures immune to sleep effects are immune to this effect.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Pebble ~ ST.MOD				DESC:You transmute up to three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A creature makes a normal ranged attack to use one of the transmuted pebbles. Each pebble that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the enhancement bonus). Against undead creatures, this damage doubles (2d6+2 points). Diminished Effects: Each pebble deals only 1d4+1 points of damage (or 2d4+2 points against undead). Heightened Effects: The stones strike with such force that they may drive a creature backward. Any target hit by a pebble is bull rushed. The stones are considered Small (-4 penalty) and charging (+2 bonus). They have an effective Strength bonus equal to one-third your caster level (minimum +1). A creature that fails its Strength check must move backward 5 feet.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Phantom Trap ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Casting this spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100 percent certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung," its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time. If another phantom trap is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails. Diminished Effects: The spell lasts only one hour per level. Heightened Effects: You may include a secondary illusion (as lesser illusory object) to be cast when the trap is sprung. For example, when the fake trap on a door is sprung, you may have an illusion of a brick wall appear behind the door.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Plunge Deep to the Core ~ ST.MOD	DESC:A weapon affected by this spell bypasses damage reduction. Plunge deep to the core allows a weapon to ignore +1 DR for every five caster levels (maximum +4 DR). Thus, a 10th level caster allows a weapon to ignore all damage reduction of +2 or less. (Alternatively, at 1st to 10th levels it ignores DR "/magic" and at 11th to 20th levels it ignores DR "/any special material.") This spell does not reduce damage reduction. A weapon that ignores +3 DR or less gains no special benefit if striking a creature with +4 DR. This spell does not stack with weapon bonuses. Diminished Effects: Duration lasts 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: Target is one weapon per three levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Power Craft ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You provide a source of locomotion for a cart, wagon, boat, or ship. The vehicle can be no larger than 10 feet long plus 2 feet per level (a 5th-level greenbond can power a 20- foot-long vessel). The vehicle can move at any speed up to its normal maximum speed as if it had a natural source of locomotion. Thus, a carriage could be made to move without a horse pulling it, up to the speed it could normally attain with a horse to pull it. Likewise, a sailing ship moves as if powered by a favorable wind. Prevailing conditions-wind, inclines, and so on-affect movement normally. Thus, this spell cannot move a sailing ship against a gale-force wind. Diminished Effects: Duration lasts 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: Duration lasts 24 hours.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Preserve Ice ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Ice you touch will not melt. It remains wet and cold, but does not diminish in mass. Heightened Effects: The duration is Permanent (D).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Proficiency ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You gain proficiency with a single weapon that you hold in your hand at the time of casting. This spell gives you no special bonus with the weapon, but you do not suffer the nonproficiency penalty while using it. Diminished Effects: You suffer only a -1 nonproficiency penalty. Heightened Effects: You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack rolls with the weapon.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Quick Boost ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Calling up a short-lived but intense burst of positive energy,you bestow a +2 enhancement bonus to the Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity score of one creature. Heightened Effects: The enhancement bonus is +4.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Redemptive Redress ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You compensate after the fact for the effects of any ongoing detrimental spell. If a character is affected by a spell that makes her suffer a -1 morale penalty on attacks and saves against fear, then redemptive redress grants a +1 morale bonus to attacks and saves against fear. If a curse causes a character to suffer a -6 penalty to Strength, this spell grants a +6 bonus to Strength. Redemptive redress affects only targets affected by spells with a noninstantaneous duration. This spell does not heal wounds (or compensate for them), although it will grant bonuses to ability scores to compensate for very temporary effective losses. Diminished Effects: This spell can compensate for only one spell that confers a penalty of -2 or less. Heightened Effects: This spell compensates for any spells cast upon its target during its duration.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Remove Fear ~ ST.MOD			DESC:The sound of tiny harps fills the air, and your targets are surrounded by a clear white light. This instills courage in the subjects, granting them a +4 morale bonus against fear effects for 10 minutes. If a subject is under the influence of a fear effect when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration. Diminished Effects: You must know each target's truename to affect him. The spell gains the truename descriptor. Heightened Effects: The bonus against fear effects increases to +6. Additionally, the targets gain a +1 morale bonus on all other Will saves.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Remove Minor Malady ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You remove a wart, blemish, mole, or other minor physical malady from the target touched. The malady must be visible and natural, not caused by magic. This spell is not powerful enough to deal with anything that actually harms the target (like a disease). Heightened Effects: The malady can be magical, but the spell still cannot handle anything that truly harms the target.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Rogue's Stab ~ ST.MOD			DESC:The target gains the ability to make sneak attacks as an unfettered against opponents denied their Dexterity bonus or those that are flanked. The target inflicts +1d6 points of damage with such an attack. If the target can make sneak attacks already, the damage she inflicts with her sneak attacks increases by +1d6. Diminished Effects: Duration becomes 1 round. Heightened Effects: The target also gains a +4 competence bonus to Sneak.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Secret of Flame ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You whisper words of magic that travel to a target fire. It either bursts in a shower of blinding fireworks or it billows out in a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on the version of the spell you choose. The target fire source immediately goes out (though a fire so large that it exceeds a 20- foot cube is only partly extinguished). Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level. Fireworks: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source (including yourself) to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will save negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness. Smoke Cloud: A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, proves ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take -4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude save negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after a creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply. Diminished Effects: The spell's range becomes Medium (100 feet + 10 feet per level). Creatures blinded by fireworks are blinded for only 1 round. The smoke cloud spreads only in a 15-foot radius and lasts a maximum of 5 rounds. Fire creatures take no damage from this spell. Heightened Effects: The blindness from fireworks lasts 2d4+1 rounds. The smoke cloud spreads out in a 300-foot radius. Fire creatures take 2 points of damage per caster level but are allowed a Fortitude save for half damage.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Shatter ~ ST.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you sing a piercing note, shout an arcane word, clap your hands, or produce a similarly sharp noise. This spell amplifies the sound to create a loud, ringing blast that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature. Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of normal crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces. Objects weighing more than 1 lb. per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered. Alternatively, you can target this spell to sunder a single solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 lbs. per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight) or a crystalline or crystal-woven item, shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage. Diminished Effects: You may use this spell only as an area attack. It proves too unwieldy in its diminished form to be focused against a single target. Heightened Effects: If you cast shatter as an area attack, creatures in the area must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d3 days. You can target noncrystalline creatures, but such creatures take only 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum of 10d4) with a Fortitude save allowed for half damage. If such a creature fails its Fortitude save, it must save again or be deafened for 1d3 days.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Shelter From The Storm ~ ST.MOD	DESC:You create an umbrellalike shield of force over the head of a single creature that protects it from natural rain, snow, or hail. It provides no protection against spell effects, or an unnatural rain (such as an acid rain). Any solid blow destroys the shield (it has 1 hit point). The shield moves with the creature you assign it to, but it remains parallel with the ground at all times. You may change the assigned creature as a standard action. Diminished Effects: The duration becomes 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: The duration is the length of the condition being protected against (rainstorm, etc.) or 24 hours, whichever comes first.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Shieldbreaker ~ ST.MOD			DESC:The weapon you cast this spell upon becomes particularly useful against opponents with shields. The wielder ignores armor and enhancement bonuses to a foe's Armor Class gained from a shield. Further, instead of making a normal attack, the weapon's wielder can make a sundering attack against a nonmagical shield that automatically destroys the shield if the attacker wins the opposed roll. (See the rules for attacking objects in Chapter Seven: Playing the Game in Arcana Evolved.) Shields with a +3 enhancement bonus or the equivalent in magical abilities are immune to this spell. If used against a foe with the mage blade's shimmering shield or the champion's call shield ability active, this weapon immediately dispels the shield. Diminished Effects: Magical shields are immune to the shieldbreaking ability conferred by the spell. Heightened Effects: The wielder can use the shieldbreaking ability once for every three caster levels during the duration of the spell.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Status ~ ST.MOD				DESC:When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, status allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You remain aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned, diseased, confused, or the like. Once you have cast the spell upon the targets, the distance between them and you does not affect the spell, as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a target leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it. You must know a target's truename in order to cast this spell. Diminished Effects: The spell lasts for 10 minutes per level. Heightened Effects: You do not need to know the target's truename; in addition, the spell loses the truename descriptor.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Sun Bond ~ ST.MOD				DESC:Casting this spell brings the hint of a feral look to your eyes. You instantly know the direction of the sunrise relative to your current position. The spell may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of the sun's rising point is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction. Heightened Effects: You also know the sun's current location relative to you, even if underground. The spell lasts 10 minutes per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Terrakal's Bounty ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You cast this spell on a handful of freshly picked edible plants (typically berries, fruits, nuts, or vegetables). The plants glow a healthy color, and 2d4 of them become magical. You can immediately discern which plants are affected. Each transmuted plant provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature. It also cures 1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period. Diminished Effects: Only one plant becomes magical. It retains its magical properties for 10 minutes per caster level (one hour maximum). Heightened Effects: With this version of the spell, you can affect 3d4 plants + 1 plant per three caster levels (maximum +5).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Thief Ward ~ ST.MOD			DESC:Thief ward creates an area that magnifies sounds, lessens shadows, and brightens details. All Sneak checks made within the area suffer a -10 penalty. Diminished Effects: The Sneak penalty becomes -5. Heightened Effects: The spell's duration lasts one hour per level, and you can choose to dictate that its area not follow you.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Trust ~ ST.MOD				DESC:You manipulate your voice, eyes, and facial features to make yourself seem more sincere, thus granting yourself a +5 bonus to one Bluff or Diplomacy check made during the following round. This spell cannot be made permanent. Heightened Effect: The duration lasts 1 round per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Undaunted Fixture ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You touch two objects together, one of which may be no larger than Medium size. This spell binds the objects together with a magical force. A Strength check (DC 30) is required to break the bond. Depending on the material of the objects involved, the objects themselves may break first. Diminished Effects: Breaking the bond requires a Strength check (DC 20). Heightened Effects: Breaking the bond requires a Strength check (DC 35).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Unhand ~ ST.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to attempt to disarm a creature with a blast of force. You and the defender make opposed rolls. You make a caster level check that includes both your Dexterity and Intelligence modifiers (d20 + caster level + Dexterity modifier + Intelligence modifier). The defender uses her attack bonus with the weapon in question (if the object is not a weapon, use the defender's base attack bonus plus Strength modifier). The size of the weapon or object is irrelevant. If the defender uses her weapon in two hands, she gets an additional +4 bonus. If you beat the defender's check, you disarm the defender. The object falls to the ground at the defender's feet. Diminished Effects: You add only your level to the opposed check. Heightened Effects: You can affect one target plus one additional target per five levels.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Ventriloquism ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You can make your voice (or any sound that you can normally make vocally) seem to issue from someplace else. You can speak in any language you know. With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone who hears them and rolls a successful save recognizes them as illusory (but still hears them). If you succeed at a Bluff check (DC 10), your own lips do not appear to move. Diminished Effects: You must be touching the object from which your voice issues. Heightened Effects: The range increases to Medium (100 feet + 10 feet per level).|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Vow ~ ST.MOD				DESC:You call upon the strength and wisdom of a deity, ethos, oath, or belief. As you do so, you make a vow to strike down those who oppose you. You gain a +1 luck bonus on attack and damage rolls per three caster levels (maximum +6). The bonus doesn't apply to spell damage. Diminished Effects: The spell lasts only 1 round. Heightened Effects: The bonus is +1 plus an additional +1 per three caster levels (maximum +8). Additionally, the spell lasts for one minute per level. Finally, the bonus damage applies to those spells that require an attack roll.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Warrior's Competence ~ ST.MOD		DESC:This spell heightens all of the target's warrior instincts. The subject gets a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. The target must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies. Heightened Effects: The spell lasts 10 minutes or until discharged. You may select up to three additional creatures within 15 feet of you to affect, if you know their truenames. If used in this way, the spell takes on the truename descriptor. The bonus can also be used on an initiative check.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Web Splat ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You create a tiny bit of spiderweb that possesses the strength of an average person. You can use this webbing to stick two objects together, stick an object to the floor, or attempt to stick a creature's foot to the floor or its hand to an object. You can even try to put the webbing over the creature's eyes to partially blind it (everything has 50 percent concealment to the creature). The creature gets a saving throw, and those who fail it must take a standard action and attempt a Strength check (DC 10) to tear the webs away. Likewise, if you web together two objects, a creature can tear them apart with a Strength check (DC 10), using a standard action. The webbing can support about 100 lbs., which means you could stick a 100-lb. rock to the ceiling for the duration, if you wanted. The web splat can be destroyed in 1 round by fire. Heightened Effects: Strength checks involved with the spell have DC 15 rather than DC 10, and the duration becomes one minute per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Web Strand ~ ST.MOD			DESC:You create a single ropelike strand of spiderweb that possesses the strength of an above-average person. One end of the strand is adhesive, the rest is not. You can use the sticky end to shoot the strand to the ceiling of a cave and swing across a chasm on it. You could even attempt to stick one end to a creature so it could not get away. In this case, the creature gets a saving throw, and those who fail must take a standard action to attempt a Strength check (DC 15) to tear the strand away. The web strand can support the weight of about 200 lbs. If you use it as rope (tying it to something rather than relying on the adhesive) it proves about twice as strong as a normal rope. The web strand can be destroyed in 1 round by fire. The strand has a hardness of 2 and 5 hit points. Diminished Effects: The duration becomes 1 round. Heightened Effects: Strength checks involved with the spell have DC 20 rather than DC 15, and the duration lasts one minute per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Welter ~ ST.MOD				DESC:You cause chaotic energies to shake and disorient the targets of this spell violently. Those affected are shaken (-2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws) for 1 round and must make Balance checks (DC 20) or fall prone. Diminished Effects: The spell affects one creature. Heightened Effects: The spell's effects last for 1d3 + 1 rounds. The Balance check is required each round it lasts.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Wilderness Lore ~ ST.MOD		DESC:You and the target creatures exude an amber glow that magically prevents animals from seeing, hearing, or smelling you. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the wilderness lore spell ends for all recipients. To cast this spell on creatures other than yourself, you must know their truenames. Diminished Effects: You may cast this spell only on yourself. The duration lasts 10 minutes. Heightened Effects: You may cast this spell on creatures regardless of whether you know their truenames (if you don't, it loses that descriptor). It affects creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst of your location.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Woodbane ~ ST.MOD				DESC:The area is bathed in a bright blue glow, and the air becomes more humid. As the spell is cast, you cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a Strength check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons become useless. A warped melee weapon takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls. You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, and so on. Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been warped by woodbane or by other means. You can combine multiple consecutive castings of this spell to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects. A remove curse restores the object to normal if successful. Diminished Effects: The area of the spell is only a 10- foot-radius burst. Heightened Effects: You can warp one Medium item per level.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
Zone of Truth ~ ST.MOD			DESC:It is believed that this spell originated as a faen party game. Creatures would enter the zone and be forced to tell the truth in response to ridiculous questions. The area of the spell is typically filled with a bright light. Creatures within the emanation (or those who enter it) can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures that leave the area are free to speak as they choose. The spell cannot be used to make a creature reveal its truename or to break any oath. Diminished Effects: The spell affects only a 10-foot square. The duration is reduced to 1 round per level. Heightened Effects: Creatures have a difficult time even bending the truth under the spell's effects. In order to provide an evasive answer or avoid answering a question outright, the creature must succeed on a separate Will save. Once a question has been saved against (successfully or otherwise), the creature need not make another save for that question.|PREVARGTEQ:DisplayFullSpell,1
