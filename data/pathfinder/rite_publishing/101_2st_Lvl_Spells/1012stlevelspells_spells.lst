# Amber Globes	LSTENTRY:Amber_Globes	SCHOOL:Conjuration (Creation) [Electricity]	LEVEL:Druid=3|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (one amber bead per globe)	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One globe of electricity energy/2 levels	DURATION:10 minutes/level or until expended	SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half; see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create up to five globes of electricity energy about the size of acorns, which can be hurled at targets by you or another creature, or can be detonated on command. Each globe is capable of dealing 2d6 points of electricity damage; you can hurl them singly or as multiple attacks. Each globe is a splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet, and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. Throwing a single globe is an attack action (that can be made as part of casting the spell), while throwing all the globes at a single target is a standard action (or a full-round action made as part of casting the spell). Globes not thrown during the round in which you cast the spell can be held for throwing in a subsequent round, or can be handed to other characters as a standard action. Each globe explodes upon striking any hard surface, and in addition to dealing its regular electricity damage to the target, deals 2 points of splash damage (also electricity damage) per globe in all adjacent squares. Creatures within the splash area that make a successful Reflex save take only half the splash damage, but creatures struck directly are not allowed a saving throw against the globe’s primary damage. Alternatively, you can gently toss or place a globe within 5 feet of you so that it does not explode on contact. Once in place, you can cause one or more globes to detonate by speaking a command word as a standard action if you are within 200 feet. When it detonates, the globe deals its electricity damage to all targets within a 5-foot burst. Creatures in the area that make a successful Reflex save take only half damage.

# Angry Wound	LSTENTRY:Angry_Wound	SCHOOL:Necromancy [Evil]	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M/DF (piece of broken glass)	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Living creature touched	DURATION:1 round/level (D); see text	SAVEINFO:See text; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:Upon concluding the dreadful incantation, you become fueled with awful power; your touch causes flesh to burst and weep freely. With a touch, you open an ugly wound on a living creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage (no save). Each round thereafter, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 points of damage as its flesh bursts and suppurates. If the target succeeds on two consecutive saves, the effect ends.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Arboreal Archer	LSTENTRY:Arboreal_Archer	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Druid=2|Ranger=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:One living tree or shrub (see text)	DURATION:Concentration + 2 rounds, up to 1 minute/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None; Spell Resistance no	DESC:You imbue limited intelligence to one non-sentient tree or shrub no less than 20 feet tall, allowing you to telepathically communicate simple instructions to the tree. On your command, the tree pulls back its branches and fires a volley of acorns, branches, or other debris at any target that you designate. The tree receives one ranged attack per round and its BAB equals your caster level plus your Dexterity modifier. Its attack deals 1d4 points of damage plus one point of damage per three caster levels and has a range of 30 feet. The tree is immobile, has an AC of 16, and 30 hit points. The tree is incapable of defending itself; it only attacks when directed. The spell ends two rounds after you cease concentration or the tree sustains 30 or more points of damage.

# Arcane Seal, Lesser	LSTENTRY:Arcane_Seal_Lesser	SCHOOL:Abjuration	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 minute	COMPS:V, S, M (sealing wax, gem dust worth 25gp)	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One magic seal placed on an object	DURATION:Permanent until discharged (D)	SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You create a magic seal that bears your visible arcane mark (and though you do not have to cast arcane mark to cast lesser arcane seal, it must be a spell you know). The seal you create resembles the wax seal one sees on letters and documents, and can range from 1 to 6 inches across. A lesser arcane seal is exceedingly tough, having a hardness of 10, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 25. When placed on a door or other closure (a chest, window, and so forth), the lesser arcane seal grants the portal its break DC or adds +5 to the portal’s existing break DC (whichever is higher). The seal is unaffected by knock spells unless the caster makes a caster level check (DC 12 + your caster level). A rogue or other character with the trapfinding class feature can break the seal with a DC 27 Disable Device check. At your option, you can also imbue the seal with magical energy so that any creature breaking it takes 1d8 points, plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +5), of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. AD Each kind of damaging seal also has a particular effect: • Acid: A lesser acid seal leaves a patch of acid on the victim if it fails a Reflex save, dealing 1 point of continuing acid damage each round for 1d4 rounds. The affected creature can make another Reflex save as a full-round action to neutralize the acid (assuming no other means to do so is available). • Cold: A lesser cold seal slows the victim (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. • Electricity: A lesser electricity seal leaves the dazed for 1 round on a failed save. • Fire: A lesser fire seal leaves the victim dazzled for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. • Sonic: A lesser sonic seal produces an audible wail for 1 round when broken, audible to anyone within 60 feet. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall, then triple the result for quiet conditions (to a maximum of 180 feet). When you add a damaging effect to the seal, you must add additional runes to the seal. Anyone can read these runes and discover the seal’s effect with a DC 12 Spellcraft check. You can disable a lesser arcane seal simply by touching it and using a standard action to dismiss the spell. At the time you create the seal, you can specify a password or phrase that allows other creatures to break the seal with no difficulty, and without triggering any damaging effects.

# Augment Poison	LSTENTRY:Augment_Poison	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Druid=2|Ranger=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:1 non-magical poison dose/3 levels	DURATION:10 min./level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object); Spell Resistance yes (harmless, object)	DESC:This spell makes poison more potent and toxic. Any dose of poison affected by the spell has its Fortitude DC changed to (10 + 1/2 caster level + spellcasting ability modifier). Furthermore, any ability damage caused by the poison does one additional point of damage each round and its duration is increased by 1 round. For example, if you had one dose of standard wyvern poison; injury; save DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves; and it were augmented by an 11-th level wizard with a Intelligence score of 22, it would become augmented wyvern poison; injury; save DC 21; frequency 1/round for 7 rounds; effect 1d4+1 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. If the duration of the spell expires, the augmented effect ends immediately. Thus, if a person has suffered 6 rounds of the augmented wyvern poison and the spell ends before the 7th round it would not deal damage on the seventh round. This spell only affects discrete doses of poison, though they may already be placed on a weapon, trap, or other item. Thus, if the spell were cast on a 10-gallon vat of wyvern poison, it would have no effect. A dose of poison under the effect of this spell is considered a magically modified poison and does radiate magic.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Bear’s Curse	LSTENTRY:Bears_Curse	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Creature touched	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:Will partial; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Constitution; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit points return when the subject’s Constitution returns to normal. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a bear’s endurance, break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Bear’s curse counters bear’s endurance.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Beguile	LSTENTRY:Beguile	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Bard=2	CASTTIME:1 move action	COMPS:V	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGET:One humanoid creature	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Will partial; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You cloud the mind of the target creature, making him more susceptible to charms and illusions. The subject is dazzled and takes a -4 circumstance penalty on all saving throws against enchantment and illusion spells and effects. A successful Will save negates the dazzled condition and the target suffers only a -2 circumstance penalty on all saving throws against enchantment and illusion spells and effects.

# Break Object	LSTENTRY:Break_Object	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2|Druid=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 round	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:10 ft.	TARGET:One object of up to 10 cu. ft./level or one construct creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object); Spell Resistance yes (object), and see text	DESC:This spell damages objects, reducing the object’s hit point total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total (the object cannot be repaired or gain hit points using this spell). This also causes the object to gain the broken condition; this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. Magic items can be broken by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than the caster level of the object. This spell also deals 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 5d6) but it cannot reduce the construct‘s total hit point total to one hit point below half its maximum hit point total. When break object is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Brightmatter	LSTENTRY:Brightmatter	SCHOOL:Conjuration (Creation) [Light]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2|Druid=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (live firefly)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	EFFECT:Blob of phosphorescent matter	DURATION:1 hour/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None; Spell Resistance no	DESC:You create a luminous mass of ectoplasm that generates bright light in a 20-foot radius and shadowy light in a 40-foot radius. The mass is sticky and pliable, and can adhere to inanimate objects, walls, ceilings, floors, and so on. You can divide the brightmatter into smaller separate pieces, but doing so reduces the amount of light that each piece sheds. Pieces Bright Shadowy 1 piece 20 ft. 40 ft. 2 pieces 15 ft. 30 ft. 3 pieces 10 ft. 20 ft. 4 pieces 5 ft. 10 ft. 5 pieces – 5 ft. Brightmatter does not generate heat.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Bull’s Curse	LSTENTRY:Bulls_Curse	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Creature touched	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:Will partial; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Strength; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, bull’s strength, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Bull’s curse counters bull’s strength.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Cat’s Curse	LSTENTRY:Cats_Curse	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Creature touched	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:Will partial; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Dexterity; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, grace, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Cat’s curse counters cat’s grace.

# Chaotic Bolt	LSTENTRY:Chaotic_Bolt	SCHOOL:Conjuration (Creation) [Chaos]	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (pinch of raw earth), F (crossbow bolt)	RANGE:Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	EFFECT:One bolt of random energy	DURATION:1 round + 1 round/3 levels	SAVEINFO:No; Spell Resistance no	DESC:A bolt of the chaotic energies of creation springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The bolt deals 2d4 points of damage of a random type with no splash damage. For every three caster levels you possess, the energy, unless neutralized, lasts for another round (to a maximum of 6 additional rounds at 18th level), dealing another 2d4 points of damage in each round. Each round, roll on the chart to determine the damage type. d10 Energy Type 1-2 Acid 3-4 Cold 5-6 Electricity 7-8 Fire 9-10 Sonic	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Chilling Mist	LSTENTRY:Chilling_Mist	SCHOOL:Conjuration (Creation)	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=3|Druid=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M	RANGE:20 ft.	EFFECT:Cloud spreads in 60-ft. radius, 60-ft. high	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Fortitude half; see text; Spell Resistance yes; see text	DESC:You cause a stationary cloud of icy vapor to rise all around you. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). In addition, all creatures take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage (treat as cold damage for the purpose of resistance) each round they remain in the mist. Creatures are entitled to a Fortitude save each round to halve the damage. A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Code Skill	LSTENTRY:Code_Skill	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:One creature and one construct touched	DURATION:10 min./level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)	DESC:Code skill gives a construct a number of ranks in a single skill equal to those possessed by another creature the caster is touching when the spell is cast. A non-intelligent construct cannot gain the benefits of Intelligence– or Charisma-based skills. The maximum number of ranks a construct can gain by code skill is equal to its Hit Dice.

# Confront Outsider	LSTENTRY:Confront_Outsider	SCHOOL:Abjuration	LEVEL:Paladin=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M/DF (holy water)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETS:Up to 2 HD/level of outsiders, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:1 min./level	SAVEINFO:Will partial; Spell Resistance no	DESC:You cause outsiders within range to lose any benefits of concealment and you gain a circumstance bonus equal to your caster level to Perception checks to notice a hidden or disguised outsiders. On a failed save, outsiders must reveal their true name, granting you a sacred bonus to attack and damage against evil outsiders equal to one-third you caster level (maximum +5).

Whenever the creature takes 4 or more points of damage, the spell discharges, suffusing the creature with positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage. If used against undead, this spell is triggered in one of two ways, dealing 1d8 points of additional damage either the next time the undead target takes normal damage, or the next time the undead target is ‘healed’ by taking negative energy damage. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage. A creature may only be under the effect of one contingent healing spell (of any sort) at a time.

# Coward's Bane	LSTENTRY:Coward's_Bane	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Paladin=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:Personal	TARGET:You	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)	DESC:You gain a sacred bonus to your attack and damage rolls equal to one-third your caster level against dishonorable opponents (maximum +5). This opponent must in the current encounter have attempted a dishonorable attack. Dishonorable attacks include all ranged attacks, sneak attacks, ambushes, poison use, subtle magical attacks (subject to GM adjudication), or attempted an attack while you are helpless, surprised, or massively and obviously outclassed (CR is 7 or greater than your current character level, etc.).

# Curse of Prevarication	LSTENTRY:Curse_of_Prevarication	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (a tooth of a liar)	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:One creature	DURATION:1 day/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:The victim of this curse is unable to tell the truth. While under its effects, the subject must speak the opposite of any truthful phrases it intended. It can choose not to speak, but nothing it says can be true.	COUNTERS:Curse of Truth	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Damage Loins	LSTENTRY:Damage_Loins	SCHOOL:Necromancy [Evil]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V	RANGE:Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	TARGET:One living humanoid creature	DURATION:Instantaneous; see text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You afflict a target creature with a painful contusion of the groin. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6), may only move at half speed, and becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Deathchant	LSTENTRY:Deathchant	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Bard=2	CASTTIME:1 round	COMPS:V, S, M (miniature knife)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	EFFECT:30-ft.-radius spread	DURATION:Concentration + 2 rounds (D); see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates, see text; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:Your chanting creates a wave of negative energy that spreads out from you, dealing 1 point of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5 points) each round to all living creatures in the area of effect. If a creature makes a successful save, it is immune to the effects of that particular casting of the spell (even if it leaves the effect but later enters it again). A creature that fails a save stops taking damage if it leaves the area, but resumes taking damage if it enters again later. Because undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such creatures of a like amount of damage, rather than harming them.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Delude Divination	LSTENTRY:Delude_Divination	SCHOOL:Illusion (Glamer) [Chaos]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One creature or object, up to a 10-ft. cube in size	DURATION:1 hour/level	SAVEINFO:None; Spell Resistance no	DESC:Divinations cast on the target are scrambled, giving random results to effects that detect auras (detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, and the like). If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spelleaster who cast the delude divination. If successful, the divination works normally for its duration. Otherwise, the divination is nullified, giving random results each minute. For spells that detect presence or absence, there is a 50%% chance for either possibility, rolled each minute that the divination is focused on the target. For spells that determine intensity, roll 1d6.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Destabilize Magic	LSTENTRY:Destabilize_Magic	SCHOOL:Evocation [Chaos]	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M/DF (a bottle of wine and 25 gp worth of cold-iron dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	AREA:20-ft.-radius emanation	DURATION:2 hours/level	SAVEINFO:None; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:This spell imbues an area with chaotic energies. The save DC to resist spells, spell-like, and supernatural abilities within the area of this spell suffer a -10 destabilizing penalty and then add a 1d20 destabilizing bonus to their DC. So for example if a wizard’s fireball, a demon’s spell-like cone of cold, and a green dragon’s breath weapon all have a normal Reflex DC of 25, within the area of this spell that Reflex DC would be 15+1d20. Spells or effects without Save DCs are not affected by this spell.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Dimension Hop	LSTENTRY:Dimension_Hop	SCHOOL:Conjuration [Teleportation]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (loop of twisted parchment)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:You, your familiar, cohort or companion, and touched objects or other touched willing creatures	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None and Will negates (object); Spell Resistance no and yes (object)	DESC:You instantly hop from your current location to any other spot within range. If the spot you choose is within your line of sight, you arrive there unerringly and can take a move action if you have one available to you. If your destination is not in line of sight, you must be able to visualize the spot or state the direction and distance to it, but your hop has a 25%% chance of a mishap and you cannot take any further actions until your next turn. No matter what your destination, you can transport only yourself and a maximum 100 lb. (or your maximum load, whichever is less) of objects you carry or touch. You cannot transport any creature except for your familiar or an animal companion or cohort of up to Tiny size (whose weight counts against your load limit). If you suffer a mishap or arrive in a place already occupied by a solid body, you and any creatures with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and are shunted to the Astral Plane.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Dire Form	LSTENTRY:Dire_Form	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Druid=2|Ranger=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M/DF (a hair from a dire creature)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One animal or magical beast	DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)	DESC:Dire form causes a regular animal or magical beast to change into a more feral, more powerful form. The target animal or magical beast, which must not have more hit dice than you, gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +2 enhancement bonus to natural armor. All of the target’s natural weapons improve as if it possessed the Improved Natural Attack feat. (The effect of this spell stacks with the actual feat, but not other magical sources.) This spell does not provide you with any additional way of controlling the animals affected, and indeed, it tends to make them more aggressive (increase animal Empathy DC by +5, and it gains a second chance to break any charm or compulsion effects).

# Disguise Wounds	LSTENTRY:Disguise_Wounds	SCHOOL:Illusion (Glamer)	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)	RANGE:Personal or Touch	TARGETAREA:You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level	DURATION:1 min./level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)	DESC:The caster of this spell can give to the subject the visual and auditory illusion of any combination of: damage reduction, resistance, immunity to damage, fast healing or regeneration. The nature of the illusion is chosen at the time of casting and cannot be changed. A creature that interacts with the glamer may attempt to disbelieve the illusion.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Distortion Field	LSTENTRY:Distortion_Field	SCHOOL:Evocation [Sonic]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 min./level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes	DESC:Distortion field constantly emits fluctuating ultrasonic pulses of sound and vibration designed to confuse creatures that rely upon blindsight or tremorsense to gather sensory information from their immediate vicinity. Such creatures still do not need to make Perception checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within range of its blindsight or tremorsense ability. However, any opponent the creature cannot see still has total concealment against it, and it still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Creatures with blindsight (but not tremorsense) affected by distortion field are affected by visibility conditions and will be impacted accordingly (such as not being able to navigate reliably in the dark, etc.). A creature with blindsight or tremorsense affected by distortion field is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Dust Wall	LSTENTRY:Dust_Wall	SCHOOL:Evocation [Earth]	LEVEL:Druid=2|Ranger=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V|S|DF	MATERIAL:Pinch of dirt or sand	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)		EFFECT:Wall up to 5 ft./level long and 10 ft./level high (S)	DURATION:1 round/level (D)		SAVEINFO:None or Fortitude partial; see text; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You raise a roiling curtain of airborne dust about a foot thick. Living creatures passing through the wall must make a successful Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The wall is semisolid and does not block line of sight or line of effect, but provides soft cover (+4 AC) to anyone behind it. The squares containing the wall are difficult terrain (each square moved counts as two squares of movement, with each diagonal counting as three squares). The wall must always stand on the ground, and you can make it twice as long by making it half as high (10 ft./level long and 5 ft. high). As a move action, you can direct it to move along the ground at up to 20 feet each round.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Eagle’s Curse	LSTENTRY:Eagles_Curse	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V|S	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:Will partial; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Charisma; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell do not lose any bonus spells for the decreased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell’s effect do decrease. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, eagle’s splendor, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.	Eagle’s curse counters eagle’s splendor.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Earthmaw	LSTENTRY:Earthmaw	SCHOOL:Transmutation [Earth]	LEVEL:Druid=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V|S|DF	MATERIAL:Pinch of dirt or sand	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:Earthen maw that fills a 5-foot cube	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You transmute a section of the ground into a gaping maw. The spell affects normal earth, such as sand, clay, or stone, but not wood or metal. The maw tries to bite any creature standing on or stepping into the square where you create it (including you or your allies), attacking by making a CMB grapple check (CMB equal to your caster level plus your caster ability modifier). It automatically grabs and tries to establish a hold. If the maw successfully establishes or maintains a hold, it deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage plus your caster ability modifier bonus lethal or nonlethal damage at your option, chosen during casting). The maw can grab or hold only one creature at a time, but it makes a new CMB check each round in your turn once it has seized a creature. If it succeeds with a second CMB check against a Medium or smaller creature, the maw swallows it, dealing another 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage. There is no air inside the maw, and a swallowed creature also automatically takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage each round until the spell ends or it manages to escape (but is still grappled even if it succeeds). The maw can hold one Medium, two Small, four Tiny, eight Diminutive, or sixteen Fine creatures, and can grapple (but not swallow) other creatures even when it is full. Creatures still in the maw when the spell ends are expelled from the earth, taking 1d6 points of damage. The maw itself is impervious to damage, but anything that destroys the 5-foot cube of earth ends the spell and frees any creature held inside. A stone shape counters and dispels earthmaw, and a transmute rock to mud effect cast on the earthmaw’s square ends the spell but leaves any formerly trapped creatures submerged in the mud.

# Earthskin	LSTENTRY:Earthskin	SCHOOL:Abjuration	LEVEL:Druid=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V|S	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 min./level or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains DR 5/magic. It ignores the first 5 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though a magic weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 50 points), it is discharged.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Envenomed Skin	LSTENTRY:Envenomed Skin	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Druid=2|Ranger=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V|S|M/DF (a frog)	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 min./level	SAVEINFO:None (see text)	SPELLRES:No	DESC:The caster’s skin becomes mottled with violet, poison-filled pustules. Any time the caster suffers physical damage (but not energy damage), there is a 50% chance that one or more of the pustules will rupture, spewing forth a poison. Anyone within 5 feet must make a Reflex save or be struck by the magically created poison. The save for the poison itself is a Fortitude save of the same DC as envenomed skin. Poison: contact; save DC of the spell; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save. As a standard action, the caster can voluntarily rupture a pustule, which has the same effect. The effect of the spell incurs a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks, except that it confers a +2 circumstance bonus on all Disguise checks.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Euphoria	LSTENTRY:Euphoria	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Bard=3|Cleric/Oracle=3|Sorcerer/Wizard=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V|S	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:1 round + 1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The affected creature is struck by pure pleasure. He suffers a -4 inherent penalty to Wisdom and gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. In addition, the subject gains a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws versus fear (for a net +2 to saving throws versus fear including the Wisdom penalty). He does not fall unconscious if brought to negative hit points, being only disabled each round until dying or healed to positive hit points.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Examine Coffin    LSTENTRY:Examine Coffin    SCHOOL:Divination (Scrying)    LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle 2|Sorcerer/Wizard 2    CASTTIME:1 standard action    COMPS:V, S, F/DF (a small glass lens)    RANGE:Touch    TARGETAREA:Coffin, Sarcophagus, or Burial Niche Touched    DURATION:1 round/level (D)    SAVEINFO:None    SPELLRES:No    DESC:Examine coffin allows the caster to touch any sealed burial receptacle and see its contents. The spell magically illuminates the coffin’s interior, although it does not enable the caster to see through magical darkness or to view the inside of a casket protected by magical means or lead sheeting. Upon touching the coffin, the caster receives a cursory view of the coffin’s interior that reveals no hidden objects or precise details. On the subsequent round, the caster may attempt a Perception check to locate any objects not in plain view, or gather additional details, but he still cannot see objects concealed by an intervening barrier, such as the body itself or a false bottom. Viewing the coffin’s interior in the former manner only requires a standard action, while conducting a more thorough examination necessitates a full-round action. The caster may touch and examine multiple coffins until the spell expires.
# Exhaustion	LSTENTRY:Exhaustion	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V	RANGE:Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The subject of this spell becomes exhausted. An exhausted character moves at half normal speed and suffers a -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After one hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. Since this spell is instantaneous, the effect cannot be dispelled. Spells that relieve exhaustion will work normally on the subject.	SOURCEPAGE:SourcePageLinkHere
# Expeditious Charge	LSTENTRY:Expeditious Charge	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 swift action	COMPS:V|S	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round	DESC:You gain the abilities to move quickly and to better move past enemies. Your base land speed increases by 20 feet (this counts as an enhancement bonus). You gain a +5 competence bonus to Acrobatics checks, and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by passing through another creature’s threat area.
# Exploding Critical	LSTENTRY:Exploding Critical	SCHOOL:Transmutation [Force]	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:S	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Weapon touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	DESC:This spell instills the target weapon with a hidden potential. Whenever the weapon deals a successful critical hit, it deals an additional 1d8 points of force damage. If the weapon has a critical modifier of X3 it deals 2d8, and if the modifier is X4 it deals 3d8. Even creatures immune to critical hits suffer this damage.
# Fall Up	LSTENTRY:Fall Up	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Personal	TARGET:You	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)	DESC:After casting this spell, gravity reverses for you and all of your equipment. You fall upwards at the normal rate. You continue to fall until the duration ends, or something stops your fall (such as a ceiling, ropes, etc.). You may act normally upside down. Any items that leave your possession are affected by gravity normally, and any item that enters your possession has its gravity reversed. Once the duration of the spell ends, you fall gently at a rate of 60 feet for one round and suffer no damage if you reach the ground. After you fall normally.
# Fit of Pique	LSTENTRY:Fit of Pique	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGET:One living creature	DURATION:1 round	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Your words cause your target’s face to twist and contort as he turns to vent his wrath on his ally. You force a target to attack its nearest ally. This attack can be of any sort, but it must be an attack that, to the creature’s knowledge, deals damage and is the most effective form of attack in the target’s arsenal. If the creature has no ally, or if all its allies are out of attack range, it takes no actions but defends itself normally.
# Flexarmor	LSTENTRY:Flexarmor	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2|Druid=2|Paladin=2|Ranger=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Armor or shield touched	DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object, harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (object, harmless)	DESC:Flexarmor causes a single set of armor or a shield to become more malleable and less restrictive. The target’s armor check penalty is reduced by 2, +1 for every five caster levels (maximum of +6 at level 20). Its maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 1, +1 for every five caster levels (maximum increase of +5 at level 20). The arcane spell failure chance is decreased by 10%, +5% for every five caster levels (maximum decrease of 30% at level 20). This spell cannot reduce the armor check penalty or spell failure chance below 5%.
# Fool’s Luck	LSTENTRY:FoolsLuck	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Druid=2|Paladin=2|Ranger=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Creature touched	DURATION:1 min./level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes luckier with respect to traps and hazards. The spell grants a +2 luck bonus to all saves against traps, hazards, diseases, and poisons. The subject also gains a +2 luck bonus to Perception and Disable Device checks. While subject to fool’s luck, any damage dealt by traps or hazards is reduced by 5 points.
# Force Club	LSTENTRY:ForceClub	SCHOOL:Evocation [Force]	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch		EFFECT:Club of force		DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create a shimmering club of pure force energy to appear in your hand or in the hand of any one creature you touch. This weapon is wielded as a club (simple weapon). It deals 1d6+1 point of damage per two caster levels (maximum +10), plus the wielder’s Strength modifier. If the wielder ever relinquishes hold of the club, it dematerializes and cannot be reformed. The first time it strikes a creature with spell resistance, you make a caster level check. If you overcome the resistance, the force club works against that creature for the duration of the spell. If it fails, the beat stick dematerializes. As a force effect, this spell can affect ethereal and incorporeal creatures.
# Fox’s Curse	LSTENTRY:FoxsCurse	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched		DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:Will partial	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Intelligence; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to Intelligence-based skill checks and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not lose any additional bonus spells for the reduced Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell’s effect do decrease. This spell doesn’t reduce any skill ranks. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, fox’s cunning, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Fox’s curse counters fox’s cunning.
# Frigid Slowness	LSTENTRY:FrigidSlowness	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V	RANGE:Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:See text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You call upon the powers of unlife dealing an instantaneous 1d4 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) and the target is staggered for 1 round/level. A successful Fortitude save results in half damage and negates the staggered condition.
# Future's Boon	LSTENTRY:FuturesBoon	SCHOOL:Divination	LEVEL:Cleric=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 hour/level or until discharged	DESC:Only clerics with the luck domain gain access to this spell. You may make any one d20 roll (typically a check or attack roll) twice, then take the better of the two results. The subject must choose which die roll to affect before the roll is made, at which point the spell discharges. You may only be under the effect of one future's boon at a time.
# Guardian Beast	LSTENTRY:GuardianBeast	SCHOOL:Conjuration (Creation)	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (hair of trained guard animal)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	EFFECT:Phantom guardian beast	DURATION:1 hour/caster level or until discharged	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You call into existence a vaguely shaped, shadowy beast that stands about knee high. The beast is silent, amorphous in shape, can spread itself out like a cloak or sail to cover a large area, and leap to interpose attacks from above. It places itself between the caster and the most apparent danger, even when threatened by invisible, flanking, or otherwise unseen attackers you are unaware of, and cannot be fooled or magically contacted. This magical guardian beast blocks damage from the next successful attack made against you, absorbing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum of 8d6). No matter how much or how little damage is actually inflicted by the attack, the guardian beast winks out of existence as soon as it prevents damage from one attack, any excess damage is still taken by the caster. The effect also only prevents damage; any additional effects of an attack are not prevented (for example the effect of a vorpal weapon). A guardian beast cannot prevent damage dealt by area effect spells or similar effects. For example, it can prevent damage from a single magic missile but not multiples or from a fireball.
# Hesitate	LSTENTRY:Hesitate	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (a snail)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:1 round	SAVEINFO:Will negates; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:Hesitate causes a number of creatures in the area to hesitate and second-guess their actions. Affected creatures go last in the initiative order and ignore the first attack of opportunity they could take in each round. If more than one creature is affected by hesitate their relative initiative order remains the same relative to one another even though as a group they are moved to the end of the order.
# Hex of Chaos	LSTENTRY:Hex_of_Chaos	SCHOOL:Necromancy [Chaos]	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:1 round/level or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:This spell inflicts a new random curse on the target each round. Roll on the following table at the start of the target’s turn each round to see what the effect of the curse is, until the duration ends or it is discharged. d12 Effect 1 Ability damage; 1 point to Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, or Cha (roll 1d6 to determine Ability Score [discharges]) 2 Blinded (Permanent [discharges]) 3 Dazed 4 Deafened (Permanent [discharges]) 5 Diminution (as per reduce person [discharges]) 6 Fascinated 7 Frightened 8 Grappled (break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell [discharges]) 9 Nauseated 10 Poisoned (Fortitude DC equal to spell DC; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Strength damage; cure 1 save [discharges]) 11 Paralyzed 12 -4 penalty to Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, or Cha (roll 1d6 to determine Ability Score, cannot be reduced below 1). So a 3rd level caster could cause permanent blindness, poison, or cause diminution for only 3 rounds. If a creature is immune to an effect, or the effect is not applicable and the spell does not discharge, continue to roll again the next round.
# Ice Aegis	LSTENTRY:Ice_Aegis	SCHOOL:Abjuration	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:10 min./level or until discharged (D)	DESC:This spell sheathes you in a thin layer made entirely of ice. The ice radiates no cold and does not harm you, even as it grants you a +3 deflection bonus and fire resistance 30. Every 10 points of fire damage prevented by the spell reduces the spell’s deflection bonus by 1. When the deflection bonus drops to 0, the spell is discharged.
# Insomnia	LSTENTRY:Insomnia	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You steal away a creature’s ability to rest or sleep. The target of this spell cannot sleep, accruing penalties for fatigue in addition to being unable to heal naturally. Even creatures such as elves that normally do not sleep are unable to get a proper rest with which to re-energize to gain spells or heal naturally. This spell can be countered by a sleep spell and it can be used to counter a sleep spell or other magical means of inducing sleep.	FAQ:This spell mentions that elves do not require sleep. This is likely a hold-over from earlier versions of the game. The Pathfinder system eliminated this benefit to elves.
# Intercept Attack	LSTENTRY:Intercept Attack	SCHOOL:Abjuration	LEVEL:Paladin=2	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	COMPS:V	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:If there is an ally adjacent to you, this spell wards the ally and creates a mystic connection so that all of its wounds transfer to you. The ally takes no damage from a singular attack (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, level drain or death effects. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not deal the types listed above such as blown away, charm, compulsion, and knocked down conditions and effects, are not affected.
# Languor	LSTENTRY:Languor	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous (see text)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You cause a black aura of negative energy to form on your hand that suppresses the life force of any living creature you touch. You must make a touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1 negative level. Assuming the subject survives, it regains the lost level after a number of minutes equal to your caster level (maximum 10 minutes). Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from languor don’t last long enough to do so. An undead creature touched by the spell gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
# Lifechant	LSTENTRY:Lifechant	SCHOOL:Conjuration (Healing)	LEVEL:Bard=2	CASTTIME:1 round	COMPS:V, S, M (miniature knife)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	AREA:30-ft.-radius spread	DURATION:Concentration + 2 rounds (D); see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates, see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Your chanting creates a wave of positive energy that spreads out from you, curing 1 point of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5 points) each round to all living creatures in the area of effect. Because undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals such creatures a like amount of damage rather than curing them. If an undead creature makes a successful save, it is immune to the effects of that particular casting of the spell (even if it leaves the emanation but later enters it again). Undead that fail their saves stop taking damage if they leave the area, but resume taking damage if they enter it again later.
# Luckwing	LSTENTRY:Luckwing	SCHOOL:Conjuration (Summoning)	LEVEL:Druid=2|Ranger=2	CASTTIME:1 round	COMPS:V, S, M, DF (one dead butterfly)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	AREA:One golden butterfly	DURATION:1 min./level (D)	SAVEINFO:None; Spell Resistance no	DESC:Casting this spell creates a one-foot-long golden butterfly (use stats for a stirge except it does not possess its melee attack, scent ability, or its special abilities). This butterfly is under your complete control, and you are empowered to see, hear, and feel everything the butterfly does. The butterfly triggers any traps and suffers any damage a normal stirge would.
# Memory Crystal	LSTENTRY:Memory_Crystal	SCHOOL:Divination	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (crystal or gem worth 50 gp)	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:1 crystal or gem touched	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:None; Spell Resistance no	DESC:You store personal memories into a small crystal or gem. The memory must be one that you experienced or saw firsthand (which means you store the memory of hearing a tale told to you that you didn’t experience, but not of the tale itself). The stored memory can last no longer than ten minutes, but can hold only one memory. You can recall the memory at any time. The recalled memory takes the form of a mental picture of the memory viewed in front of you as though literally through your eyes. As a result of this, others near you can also possibly see the memory. In order to recall a memory from a memory crystal that was not created by the person attempting the recall, the character must make a Spellcraft check (DC = 10 + the creator’s caster level). The caster of the memory crystal can dispel the memory from the gem at will, making it a normal crystal or gem again (this is a free action). You can put a new memory into the crystal or gem at that time by casting this spell again (this erases the former memory). Others must use a dispel magic spell targeted on the memory crystal in order to destroy the memories stored within.
# Mire of Stone and Earth	LSTENTRY:Mire_of_Stone_and_Earth	SCHOOL:Transmutation	LEVEL:Druid=2|Ranger=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	AREA:Earth or stone in a 40-ft.-radius spread	DURATION:1 min./level (D)	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial; see text; Spell Resistance no	DESC:The very earth twists and writhes, creatures that fail their save gain the entangled condition. Creatures that make their save move at only half their base speed in the area. Those that remain in the area must save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts. Creatures with burrow speeds are immune to the effects of mire of stone and earth.
# Mute	LSTENTRY:Mute	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=3|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:This spell renders its target incapable of speech. It is not physiological so much as a localized area around the target’s mouth (or mouths) from which no sound is able to be emitted. Thus, the target cannot grunt or otherwise produce verbal sounds of any sort, although it still may make sounds such as walking, snapping fingers, or clapping. This prevents any sort of spellcasting that requires verbal components.
# Necrophage	LSTENTRY:Necrophage	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (a maggot, alive or dead)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One corporeal undead creature or corpse	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You create a pale yellow slime on the target. The slime begins to devour the target’s flesh rapidly, causing 1d6 points of damage per round. An undead creature may attempt a Fortitude save in the first round of the spell to reduce all damage caused by the slime by half. The application of one flask of strong alcohol or an attack that deals at least 5 points of fire damage to the target negates any further damage from the spell. A small or smaller corpse is destroyed in 1 round, a medium one in 2 rounds, a large one in 3 rounds. For each size category above large add 2 rounds to the time it takes to destroy it.
# Nightsnare	LSTENTRY:Nightsnare	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (tiny fruit tarts and a feather)	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One living humanoid creature	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You spin a web of pale, dreamy light, causing a comatose slumber to come upon the target (which may include causing the subject to fall prone, any damage from which does not awaken the victim). A victim of nightsnare is helpless. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new save to end the effect. Slapping or wounding the target rouses the individual immediately, but normal noise does not. Rousing a sleeper with slaps or wounds requires an attack action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The sleeper rouses automatically when the duration of nightsnare ends.
# Oathbind	LSTENTRY:Oathbind	SCHOOL:Divination	LEVEL:Bard=2|Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 round	COMPS:V, S, M/DF (a drop of each participant’s blood)	RANGE:See Text	TARGET:See Text	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:None (see text); Spell Resistance no	DESC:Whenever two or more parties enter into a binding, written contract, this spell enables all of the parties to instantaneously become aware of a breach in that contract as long as the offender and the affected parties are on the same plane of existence. The spell only affects willing participants that have signed the contract and is typically employed as a means of ensuring trustworthiness rather than enforcing the terms of the contract. At the time of the casting, all of the willing participants that signed the contract must be within the same enclosed space as the contract. (The exclusion of unwilling participants does not negate the spell.) From that point forward, all of the spell’s recipients receive a brief, visual image showing the individual that broke the terms of the contract, and how he violated the terms of the agreement. Alternatively, a recipient can dismiss the spell’s effects upon him at any time, although all of the remaining recipients become aware of his action as if he violated the contract. The GM has sole discretion when determining if the spell’s conditions have been met and the precise nature of the information provided by the spell.
# Obscure Text	LSTENTRY:Obscure Text	SCHOOL:Illusion (Glamer)	LEVEL:Bard=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (gold dust worth 50 gp)	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Text touched, up to 1 page or 1 square foot/level	DURATION:One day/Level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object); see text; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:This spell causes writings, inscriptions, and even magical symbols and glyphs to become temporarily unintelligible. The writing looks normal to the casual viewer, but seems meaningless whenever anyone tries to actively read it. When this spell is applied to nonmagical writing, characters with the Linguistics skill can attempt to piece together the meaning – add this spell’s caster level to the normal Linguistics DC (10 for writing that would be readable normally). Placing this spell on magical writing such as a scroll or spellbook increases the Spellcraft DC to decipher the writing by +1 per caster level. Placing this spell on a scribed magical ward does not disrupt the ward’s function but might prevent it from being recognized. For example, explosive runes with an obscure text spell applied still detonates when an attempt to read them is made, but the attempt won’t reveal the runes’ meaning (if any). Likewise, an illusory script with an obscure text spell applied still implants its suggestion in the minds of unauthorized readers. The Spellcraft DC to identify a ward under the effects of obscure script increases by +1 per caster level, but note that placing this spell on a ward triggered by touch activates the ward unless you succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + the ward’s caster level). Obscure text is difficult to dispel, adding a +5 bonus to its dispel check DC.
# Owl’s Curse	LSTENTRY:Owl’s Curse	SCHOOL:Necromancy	LEVEL:Cleric/Oracle=2|Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S	RANGE:Touch	TARGET:Creature touched	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:Will partial; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:You place a curse on the subject that imposes a -4 circumstance penalty to Wisdom; upon a successful save this penalty is reduced to -2. This results in the usual penalties to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl’s wisdom do not lose any additional bonus spells for the decreased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells decrease. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can also be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, owl’s wisdom, remove curse, or wish spell. Owl’s curse counters owl’s wisdom.
# Peace Bonding	LSTENTRY:Peace Bonding	SCHOOL:Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]	LEVEL:Paladin=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, DF	RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	AREA:20-ft.-radius emanation	DURATION:1 min./level	SAVEINFO:Will negates; Spell Resistance yes	DESC:Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) sheath or secure their manufactured weapons and can't unsheathe or unsecure them. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may choose to prepare unarmed attacks, spells or natural weapons. Creatures who leave the area are free to use weapons as they choose, such as ranged weapons.
# Phantom Familiar	LSTENTRY:Phantom Familiar	SCHOOL:Illusion (Glamer)	LEVEL:Sorcerer/Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	COMPS:V, S, M (special dust worth 50 gp)	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Your familiar	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:None (see text); Spell Resistance no	DESC:You make your familiar - including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment - look different. It can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You can change its apparent creature type to any magical beast or animal. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or have it look like an entirely different creature. You can change this appearance as a standard action.
