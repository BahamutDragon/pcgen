This mystical trap takes 10 minutes to prepare. The target of the mystical attack is the only one who can spring this trap and it can be detected and disabled as a trap (same as previous DC). When the target springs the trap they must make a Will save (DC 10+1/2 your character level + your Intelligence Modifier). A failed saves results in the target being rendered unconscious, maimed, or dead, this trap mystically conveys to the target once the save is required who created the trap and why. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are not affected (though they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks for one full round). Only one trap of vengeance can be in existence at a time, so if you create another the previous one will be dismissed; you always know when your trap of vengeance has been triggered (though not if it has been disabled or bypassed).
