Programed Spell		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extend Spell																					PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Extend Spell.																																														DESC:You can prepare certain spells to come into effect when triggered.																			BENEFIT:You can apply this feat to any spell, adding to the duration the concept of "until triggered" (although once triggered, the spell's duration reverts to normal). The programmed spell must be tied to an object, creature, or location, which becomes the "source" of the programmed spell when it is triggered. Triggering is based on some event set by the caster. The event can be as simple or elaborate as the caster desires, but she must determine the specifics of targets and placement beforehand. Special conditions for triggering a programmed spell can be based on a creature's name, identity, or observable actions or visible qualities such as race, or "when the door opens." Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify. An object, creature, or location can only have only one spell altered by this feat cast on it at any given time within 30' of each other, if they are they fail to trigger properly (DM's discretion). Programmed spells can be detected as traps (DC 20+spell level), are vulnerable to dispel magic as normal and can be disabled (DC 20+ spell level). A programmed spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. Further, a programmed spell requires a gem worth 500 gp per level of the spell.
