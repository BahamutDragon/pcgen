Once the spell ends, the pit disappears and the creature is deposited harmlessly on the surface. At any point during the duration of the spell other targets may be forced into this pit by means such as a bull rush. Those creatures do not receive a saving throw.

Wave of Petrification		CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=9		SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action								TARGETAREA:A 40-ft. spread centered on you												DURATION:Permanent (D)					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	DESC:A wave ripples out from you, turning everything in its path to stone, including creatures, plants, and manufactured objects. (Objects in a creature's possession turn to stone or save as the creature does. Do not roll for each item separately.) Unlike most spells, physical barriers do not protect against wave of petrification; the wave merely turns the barrier to stone, then continues to petrify everything behind it. A wall of force, a prismatic wall or sphere or an antimagic field will halt the progression of the petrifying wave. A stone to flesh spell restores victims of this spell to their natural states, if they were made of flesh (an elf, for example) but not attended objects (the elf's clothes, for example). A break enchantment, greater dispel magic, and polymorph any object can return the subject to normal. Material Components: A bit of petrified wood.
