Extradimensional Pit Trap	CLASSES:Druid=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=4		SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:A 5 ft. by 5 ft. column of ground with depth of 10 ft./level, to a maximum depth of 100 ft. (see text)	DURATION:1 round/level					SAVEINFO:Reflex negates			SPELLRES:No			DESC:You create an extra-dimensional hole in the ground or floor. If opened directly below a creature, the creature falls through the hole, taking 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet it falls. Creatures that are unable to find their own way out are stuck at the bottom of the trap for the duration of the spell. Once the spell ends, the pit disappears and the creature is deposited harmlessly on the surface. At any point during the duration of the spell other targets may be forced into this pit by means such as a bull rush. Those creatures do not receive a saving throw. You may choose to expand the area of the effect, but for every five feet of width and length, the depth of the effect is halved.

The victim's mark is noticeable to all and he has an aura of unpleasantness about him. The subject suffers a -5 penalty on all Charisma-based ability and skill checks except turning undead. The target also takes 1d6 points of damage from the brand. This damage cannot be healed until the curse is removed. The curse can only be removed with a successful caster level check (DC 15+ your caster level) so long as the material component of the spell is whole. Material Component: A brand with the symbol of a pariah.

The dragons charge over anything standing within the spell's radius. The spell inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level (15d6 maximum). Characters who fail their saves are knocked prone regardless of size and flammable objects catch fire, including flammable characters who failed their saving throws.
Torment of the Accursed		CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=8		SCHOOL:Enchantment				DESCRIPTOR:Curse|Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V, S,		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature																DURATION:Permanent (D)					SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes		DESC:When you cast this spell, you cause your target to suffer wracking pains that impose a circumstance penalty equal to your caster level (max -25) on attack rolls and skill checks. Ability checks suffer a penalty equal to the casting ability modifier of this spell (max -10). This curse can only be removed with a successful caster level check DC 15+ your caster level as long as the material component of the spell is in whole. Material Component: The target's name or an accurate description written on some type of material (usually paper).
Wave of Petrification		CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=9		SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action				TARGETAREA:A 40-ft. spread centered on you												DURATION:Permanent (D)					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	DESC:A wave ripples out from you, turning everything in its path to stone, including creatures, plants, and manufactured objects. (Objects in a creature's possession turn to stone or save as the creature does. Do not roll for each item separately.) Unlike most spells, physical barriers do not protect against wave of petrification; the wave merely turns the barrier to stone, then continues to petrify everything behind it. A wall of force, a prismatic wall or sphere or an antimagic field will halt the progression of the petrifying wave. A stone to flesh spell restores victims of this spell to their natural states, if they were made of flesh (an elf, for example) but not attended objects (the elf's clothes, for example). A break enchantment, greater dispel magic, and polymorph any object can return the subject to normal. Material Components: A bit of petrified wood.
