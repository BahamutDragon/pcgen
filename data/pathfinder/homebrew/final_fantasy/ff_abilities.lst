Implanted weapons are well concealed; detecting one requires a thorough search (Perception DC 25). Implanted weaponry can be damaged or destroyed by sundering, but cannot be disarmed. Weaponry installed in a cybernetic arm does not count against a creature's implantation limit.

This port is covered with a flap of skin when not in use. Once installed, a skillslot has no effect until a skillchip is inserted into the port. An inserted skillchip enhances the user's ability in the skill encoded on the chip; the magnitude to which the skill is enhanced depends on the power of the skillchip. This does not grant ranks in the associated skill. It takes 10 minutes for a skillchip to adjust itself to a new skillslot; during this time, the user takes a -2 penalty on all skill checks as distracting sensations flood his mind. When a skillchip is removed, its benefits end immediately, but the wearer suffers no ill effects.	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Cyberware.CyberSlot_Brain		BONUS:VAR|CyberwareImplantation|1
