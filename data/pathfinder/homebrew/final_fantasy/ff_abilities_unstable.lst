Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Bard ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor but not with any shields. Because the somatic components required for bard songs are relatively simple, a bard can perform songs while wearing light armor without incurring the normal song failure chance. However, like mages, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of song failure.
Limit Break					KEY:Bard ~ Limit Break									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:At 1st level, the bard receives the Limit Breaks (Destructive Shout and Soul Voice).
Destructive Shout				KEY:Bard ~ Destructive Shout								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:This Limit Break causes the bard to shout towards his opponents causing non-elemental damage in a 60-ft.-cone. Enemies in the area of effect take 2d6 points of non-elemental damage + an additional 2d6 points of damage per four bard levels, a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + his Charisma modifier) or be stunned for 1 round.
Soul Voice					KEY:Bard ~ Soul Voice									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:This Limit Break allows the bard to be able perform songs with double maximum variables for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four bard levels. Each song performed during the duration has all variables and effects maximized and doubled as well as song duration. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Songs						KEY:Bard ~ Songs										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:A bard performs songs from his songbook. Unlike mages, bards keep a written account of his songs in his songbook. The bard begins play with a songbook containing two 1st-level songs. At each new bard level, he gains one new song of any song level that he can perform (based on his new bard level) for his songbook. But like mages, the bard can also purchase songs for his songbook. To learn or perform a song, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the song level (Cha 11 for 1st-level songs, Cha 12 for 2nd-level songs, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's song is 10 + the song's level + the bard's Charisma modifier. In addition, a bard gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Charisma). Performing a song also requires the bard to make a Perform skill check of DC 10 + twice the song's level in addition to spending MP. Failure in making the skill check still expends the MP cost of the song. All songs have a duration of one round + the bard's Charisma modifier. The bard may do other things while the song duration is in effect, including other songs. Most songs have a radius of 30 feet, centered on the bard, unless otherwise stated.
Auras						KEY:Bard ~ Auras										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:The bard exerts an effect on allies in his vicinity. He can learn to produce different effects, or auras, over the course of his career. The bard may project one minor aura and (starting at 4th level) one major aura at a time. Projecting an aura is a swift action. The aura remains in effect until the bard uses a free action to dismiss it or activates another aura of the same kind (major or minor). A bard can have an aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before the bard takes his first turn. Activating an aura involves haranguing, ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling, or calming allies. A bard sizes up the enemy, allies, and the terrain, then gives allies the direction that they can use to do their best. Unless otherwise noted, a bard's aura affects all allies within 15 feet (including himself) who can hear the bard. An ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and be able to understand the bard's language to gain the bonus. A bard's aura is dismissed if he is dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by his allies. A bard begins play knowing one minor aura of his choice. As his bard level increases, he gains access to new auras, as indicated on Table 3-4: The Bard. All bonuses granted by a bard's auras are circumstance bonuses that do not stack with each other.

Bardic Performance			KEY:Bard ~ Bardic Performance							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:A bard is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level. Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time. At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action. Each bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both. If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and such performances are language dependent. A deaf bard has a 20%% change to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components. If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50%% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.
Countersong					KEY:Bard ~ Countersong									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal components.) Each round of the countersong he makes a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don't allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.
Distraction					KEY:Bard ~ Distraction									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a Perform (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by an illusion magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the Distraction is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous illusion magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it sees the Distraction, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don't allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.
Fascinate					KEY:Bard ~ Fascinate									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The Distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.
Inspire Courage				KEY:Bard ~ Inspire Courage								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A 1st level bard can use his performance to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the bard's performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard must choose which component to use when starting his performance.
Well-Versed					KEY:Bard ~ Well-Versed									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:At 2nd level, the bard becomes resistant to the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general. The bard gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent effects.
Versatile Performance			KEY:Bard ~ Versatile Performance							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:At 2nd level, a bard can choose one type of Perform skill. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills. When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill's bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of Perform to substitute. The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Act (Bluff, Disguise), Comedy (Bluff, Intimidate), Dance (Acrobatics, Fly), Keyboard Instruments (Diplomacy, Intimidate), Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).
Inspiration					KEY:Bard ~ Inspiration									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:During battle, the bard exhorts his comrades with words of courage and determination. This inspiration affects all allies within a 30-foot radius centered on the bard, and bestows 1d6 temporary hit points, plus 1d6 additional points for every two bard levels beyond 2nd (2d6 at 4th, 3d6 at 6th, and so on) These temporary hit points last until the battle ends, or until they are removed through damage. A bard may inspire a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. This is a move action and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The bard can choose whether or not to include himself in this effect.
Inspire Competence			KEY:Bard ~ Inspire Competence							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A bard of 3rd level or higher can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the bard's performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th). Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as Stealth, and may be disallowed at the GM's discretion. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence relies on audible components.
Troubadour					KEY:Bard ~ Troubadour									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:At 3rd level, as a swift action, the bard can double the duration of the next song the bard performs.

Major Aura					KEY:Bard ~ Major Aura									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a bard can project a major aura in addition to his minor aura.

Using dissonance requires a Perform check DC 15 + the CR of the creature. The bard's dissonance can affect only a single creature. The target creature must be within 60 feet, and must be able to hear the bard to be affected. Actions vary from the different dissonance abilities as well as duration (if any). The DC of any saving throw called for by a dissonance is equal to 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier.
Cackle					KEY:Bard ~ Cackle									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:As a standard action, the bard emits a disturbing cackle, causing a target creature to become shaken for 1 round. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the target creature becomes shaken for 3 rounds. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the target creature becomes frightened for 1 round instead. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 20 or more, then the target creature becomes frightened for 3 rounds. A successful Will save negates the effect.
Disrupt					KEY:Bard ~ Disrupt									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:As an immediate action, the bard bellows a disconcerting roar, causing a target creature that is attacking to suffer a -2 penalty to that specific attack roll. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 5 or more, then the penalty increases to -4. If the bard succeeds on his Perform check by 10 or more, then the penalty increases to -6.

Additional Song				KEY:Bard ~ Additional Song								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:Starting at 5th level, a bard can perform an additional song, allowing him to perform two songs. At 10th level, the bard can perform three songs and at 20th level, the bard can perform four songs. The Perform check is needed for each song, with a +4 to the perform DC for each song after the first.
Grant Move Action				KEY:Bard ~ Grant Move Action								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:Starting at 5th level, a bard can direct and motivate his allies to act immediately. Once per day, as a move action, he may grant an extra move action to any or all of his allies within 30 feet (but not to himself). Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order. This extra action does not affect the allies' initiative count; the round continues normally after the bard's turn is over. (This may mean, for example, that an ally whose initiative count immediately follows the bard's may get an extra move action from the bard, followed directly by a full round worth of actions on the ally's turn.) At 8th level, a bard gains the ability to grant an extra move action to his allies twice per day. The frequency increases to three times per day at 11th level, four times per day at 14th level, and five times per day at 17th level. A character can take only one extra move action per round. (In other words, two bards can't use this ability on the same ally in the same round.) If an ally chooses not to take the extra move action, it is lost.
Skilled Performer				KEY:Bard ~ Skilled Performer								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:The rattling nerves and jitteriness is long gone, replaced by a calm serenity that allows the bard to play his best music.

The bard may distribute the skill points however he wants among his Perform skills.
Inspire Greatness				KEY:Bard ~ Inspire Greatness								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:A bard of 9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally while using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level). To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.
Clear Mind					KEY:Bard ~ Clear Mind									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:At 10th level, a bard can regain his MP quicker.

A bard can use encore a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.
Soothing Performance			KEY:Bard ~ Soothing Performance							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:A bard of 12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to the cura spell, using the bard's level as the caster level. In addition, this performance removes the fatigued, sickened, and shaken condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 4 continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components.
Inspire Heroics				KEY:Bard ~ Inspire Heroics								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:A bard of 15th level or higher can inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and visual components.
Funeral Ballad				KEY:Bard ~ Funeral Ballad								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:Once per day, a bard of 18th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to Arise on a dead creature, using the bard's level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 10 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be within 10 feet of the bard for the entire performance. Funeral ballad relies on audible and visual components.
Deadly Performance			KEY:Bard ~ Deadly Performance							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:A bard of 20th level or higher can use his performance to cause one enemy to die from joy or sorrow. To be affected, the target must be able to see and hear the bard perform for 1 full round and be within 30 feet. The target receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the target is dazed for 1d4 rounds, and the bard cannot use deadly performance on that creature again for 24 hours. If a creature's saving throw fails, it dies. Deadly performance is a mind-effecting death effect that relies on audible and visual components.

Enemies within the area of effect take 1d6 points of non-elemental damage per beastmaster level, a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of beastmaster's level + Charisma modifier) for half damage.
Animal Companion			KEY:Beastmaster ~ Animal Companion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Beastmaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:A beastmaster may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: ape, bear (black), hawk, snake (medium), or wolf. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the beastmaster on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the beastmaster advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, his effective beastmaster levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Animal companions increase in size when their beastmaster reaches 7th level, depending on the companion. If a beastmaster releases his companion from service, he may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of summoning. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

Feral Combat Style		KEY:Beastmaster ~ Feral Combat Style					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Beastmaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:At 1st level, a beastmaster gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. Beastmasters are trained in fighting unarmed ferally, often mimicking their animal brothers and sisters. A beastmaster's attacks are wild, often using nails, claws and bites interchangeably. This means that a beastmaster may even make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a beastmaster striking unarmed. A beastmaster may thus apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A beastmaster's unarmed strikes always deal lethal damage. A beastmaster's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. A beastmaster also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on the table below.

Bestial Rage			KEY:Beastmaster ~ Bestial Rage						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Beastmaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:A beastmaster becomes more beast-like, taking on animal traits of his chosen animal companion, granting him additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a beastmaster can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 2 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage do not increase the total number of rounds that a beastmaster can rage per day. A beastmaster can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in rage, a beastmaster gain bonuses according to his animal companion (listed below). In addition, he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. If an animal companion grants the beastmaster an increase to Constitution, it grants the beastmaster 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While also raging, a beastmaster cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Acrobatics, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a materia), or spell completion to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A beastmaster can end his rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A beastmaster cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a beastmaster falls unconscious, his rage immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.	DESC:&nl;Ape:When raging, beastmasters with an Ape Companion gains Climb (with a +8 bonus to Climb checks) speed of 15 feet, +2 bonus to Strength, and +4 bonus to Dexterity, and a +1 Natural Armor bonus to Armor Class.

The blue mage pays MP for both spells as normal and if a concentration check is needed, she must check for both spells. She must also indicate the targets before spells are resolved.
1 MP Spell				KEY:Blue Mage ~ 1 MP Spell								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blue Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:At 18th level, three times per day, as a move action, a blue mage can reduce the cost of spells to 1 MP. Once activated, any spells the blue mage casts only cost 1 MP. This ability ends at the end of the round.
Azure Lore				KEY:Blue Mage ~ Azure Lore								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blue Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:At 19th level, three times per day, as a swift action, a blue mage can utilize any one metamagic feat she has on a blue magic spell for free.
Assimilation			KEY:Blue Mage ~ Assimilation							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blue Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:At 20th level, the blue mage absorb any special qualities from creatures she has used the Libra ability on. As a standard action, usable per day equal to the blue mage's Intelligence modifier, the blue mage may absorb only one special quality from a creature at a time. A creature affected by this ability must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 blue mage level + Intelligence modifier) or temporary loses its special quality ability. The only special quality ability that cannot be absorbed is the creature type. Absorbing a creature's special qualities overrides her own. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the blue mage's Intelligence modifier. In addition, the blue mage learns the special quality ability and may be reused at any given time with a successful appropriate Knowledge skill check of DC 15 + the CR of the creature that uses up an assimilation ability usage.

###Block - Chemist Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Chemist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:Chemists are proficient with all simple weapons, simple firearms, and bombs. Chemists are proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.
Limit Breaks			KEY:Chemist ~ Limit Breaks							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:At 1st level, the chemist receives the Limit Breaks (Mega-Potion and Perfect Bomb).
Mega-Potion				KEY:Chemist ~ Mega-Potion								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:This Limit Break transforms a single potion into a very potent version. All variable, numeric effects are maximized and doubled. It lasts for the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chemist levels before it loses all potency.
Perfect Bomb			KEY:Chemist ~ Perfect Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:This Limit Break allows the chemist to create the perfect bomb. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four chemist levels, the chemist creates one of these bombs which he can throw at double the normal range and deals maximum damage. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Bomb					KEY:Chemist ~ Bomb									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:In addition to magical extracts, chemists are adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that they can hurl at their enemies. A chemist can use a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert-their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the chemist must use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst-the chemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily refilled. Most chemists create a number of catalyst vials at the start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can create in that day-once created, a catalyst vial remains usable by the chemist for years. Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, a chemist's bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the chemist's Intelligence modifier. The damage of a chemist's bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered chemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from a chemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal 2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the chemist's level + the chemist's Intelligence modifier. Chemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up. A chemist's bomb, like an extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.
Craft Alchemical Item		KEY:Chemist ~ Craft Alchemical Item						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 1st level, chemists receive Craft Alchemical Item as a bonus feat. The chemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.
Throw Anything			KEY:Chemist ~ Throw Anything							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:All chemists gain the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. A chemist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage done with Throw Splash Weapon, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.
Throw Potion			KEY:Chemist ~ Throw Potion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a chemist can throw potions to allies within 15 feet. This improves by an additional 15 feet for every four levels afterwards to a maximum of 60 feet. The chemist must hit an AC of 10 (+/- from size). The recipient must have a hand free to catch the potion. If the recipient is adjacent to an enemy, he provokes an attack of opportunity. If the chemist has multiple attacks, he can throw up to that many potions as a full-attack action.
Discovery				KEY:Chemist ~ Discovery								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 2nd level, and then again every two chemist levels thereafter (up to 18th level), a chemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, a chemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the chemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the chemist's level + the chemist's Intelligence modifier.
Acid Bomb*				KEY:Chemist ~ Acid Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:When the chemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of non-elemental damage 1 round later.
Alchemical Bullet			KEY:Chemist ~ Alchemical Bullet							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:A chemist learns to modify bullets to carry alchemical effects, allowing them to reach farther than normal. When using Alchemical Bullet to carry the effects of a Chemist's Bomb, the chemist may modify, load and fire the bullet as part of the action of creating the bomb, instead of throwing it. The chemist may not use Discoveries to further modify the bomb. When using Alchemical Bullet to carry the effects of any other alchemical item, modifying the bullet requires a move action, while loading and firing the bullet must be performed separately. Splash weapons that have been modified to be carried by the bullet are no longer splash weapons, nor are they thrown, and do not gain the benefit of Throw Anything (including Int to damage) nor any other feat that only affects thrown or splash weapons. The chemist must provide the alchemical item and the ammunition. Prerequisites: Chemist 4
Alchemical Zombie			KEY:Chemist ~ Alchemical Zombie							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:The chemist gains the ability to animate a relatively complete corpse as an alchemy-powered zombie. This process takes 1 hour and costs 100 gil in alchemical reagents per HD of the corpse being animated; the dead creature gains the zombie template. The undead the chemist creates remains under his control indefinitely. No matter how many times he uses this discovery, however, he can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per chemist level. The created zombie is a creature, not a supernatural effect. Prerequisite: Chemist 8
Blinding Bomb			KEY:Chemist ~ Blinding Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:When the chemist creates a bomb, he can choose for it to detonate very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are inflicted with the Blind status for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute. Prerequisite: Chemist 8
Bombard*				KEY:Chemist ~ Bombard							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:As a full-attack action, the chemist can create and throw two bombs at his highest base attack bonus with a -2 penalty. Prerequisites: Chemist 6
Breath Weapon Bomb*		KEY:Chemist ~ Breath Weapon Bomb						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the chemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the chemist's bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the chemist's level + the chemist's Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Prerequisite: Chemist 6
Confusion Bomb			KEY:Chemist ~ Confusion Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:The chemist's bombs twist the target's perception of friend and foe. A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb and is inflicted with the Confuse status for 1 round per chemist level. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). Prerequisite: Chemist 8
Crude Bomb				KEY:Chemist ~ Crude Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:The chemist can throw non-magical bombs. These function as standard bombs, but deal 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of fire damage for every odd-numbered level.
Delayed Bomb			KEY:Chemist ~ Delayed Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:The chemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the chemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the chemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the chemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage (see Throw Splash Weapon) to all adjacent creatures as normal. A chemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the chemist's level + the chemist's Intelligence modifier). Prerequisite: Chemist 8
Dilution				KEY:Chemist ~ Dilution								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:Once per day, the chemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gil equal to one-quarter of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again. Prerequisite: Chemist 12
Dispelling Bomb			KEY:Chemist ~ Dispelling Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:When the chemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted dispel spell, using the chemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. Prerequisite: Chemist 6
Elixir of Life			KEY:Chemist ~ Elixir of Life							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:Once per day, the chemist can brew an elixir of life. An elixir of life, when administered by the chemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell full-life. Alternatively, the chemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a full-life spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the chemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. Prerequisite: Chemist 16
Enhance Potion			KEY:Chemist ~ Enhance Potion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the chemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.
Explosive Bomb*			KEY:Chemist ~ Explosive Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:The chemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet (see Throw Splash Weapon). Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.
Explosive Missile			KEY:Chemist ~ Explosive Missile							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:As a standard action, the chemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the chemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate. Prerequisite: Chemist 4
Force Bomb*				KEY:Chemist ~ Force Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:When the chemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of non-elemental damage, plus 1d4 points of non-elemental damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save. Prerequisite: Chemist 8
Frost Bomb*				KEY:Chemist ~ Frost Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:When the chemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict ice damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.
Grenade Gun				KEY:Chemist ~ Grenade Gun								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:A chemist further refines his abilities, allowing him to create special bullets that function identically to his bombs. When using Alchemical Bullet to carry the effects of a chemist's bomb, the chemist may use Discoveries to further modify the bomb. The Alchemical Bullet now deals splash damage, and benefits from feats that specifically improve splash weapons (But not from feats that apply to any thrown weapon). Prerequisites: Chemist 8, Alchemical Bullet
Healing Touch			KEY:Chemist ~ Healing Touch							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:The chemist gains the ability to heal other creatures. As a standard action, he may touch a creature and apply 1 use of his spontaneous healing discovery to that creature; this counts toward his spontaneous healing limit for the day. This ability only functions if the target is the same type of creature (humanoid, undead, and so on) as the chemist. Prerequisite: Chemist 6, spontaneous healing discovery
Immolation Bomb*			KEY:Chemist ~ Immolation Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:When the chemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target's body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb's effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the chemist's Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the chemist's Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the chemist's turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb's direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the chemist's level + the chemist's Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater. Prerequisite: Chemist 4
Lingering Spirit			KEY:Chemist ~ Lingering Spirit							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:The chemist is familiar enough with the ties between his body and spirit that he lingers at death's door far longer than a normal person. He treats his Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when hit point damage kills him (so a chemist with a Constitution of 10 and this discovery dies at -20 hit points instead of -10). Reducing him to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes him unconscious and comatose, but he is only killed after taking an additional 5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect, the chemist must be brought to -5 Constitution in order to be killed by these attacks). Prerequisite: Chemist 4
Madness Bomb			KEY:Chemist ~ Madness Bomb							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:The chemist's bombs do more than sear flesh-they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage. Prerequisite: Chemist 12
Nauseating Flesh			KEY:Chemist ~ Nauseating Flesh							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:The chemist's body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the chemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The chemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh. Prerequisite: Chemist 12
Plague Bomb				KEY:Chemist ~ Plague Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:The chemist's bombs is infused with disease and plague. A creature that takes a direct hit from a plague bomb takes damage from the bomb and is inflicted with the Disease status for 1 round per chemist level. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). Prerequisite: Chemist 8
Preserve Organs			KEY:Chemist ~ Preserve Organs							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:The chemist learns how to preserve and protect his vital organs, reducing the chance of a mortal wound. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the chemist, there is a 25%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This does not stack with similar abilities that negate critical hits and sneak attacks. A chemist can take this discovery up to three times; the effects stack, increasing this chance to 50%% and then 75%%.
Poison Bomb				KEY:Chemist ~ Poison Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:The chemist's bombs is infused with poison. A creature that takes a direct hit from a poison bomb takes damage from the bomb and is inflicted with the Poison status for 1 round per chemist level. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 1d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 5d6+4 points of damage instead). Prerequisite: Chemist 4
Precise Bombs			KEY:Chemist ~ Precise Bombs							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:Whenever the chemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.
Shock Bomb*				KEY:Chemist ~ Shock Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:When the chemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict lightning damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.
Spontaneous Healing		KEY:Chemist ~ Spontaneous Healing						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:The chemist gains the ability to heal from wounds rapidly. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his chemist level plus his Intelligence modifier. With one use of this ability, as a swift action, a chemist can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two chemist levels he possesses. If the chemist falls unconscious because of hit point damage and he still has healing available from this ability, the ability activates automatically each round until he is conscious again or the ability is depleted for the day.
Sticky Bomb				KEY:Chemist ~ Sticky Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:The effects of the chemist's bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later. Prerequisite: Chemist 10
Strafe Bomb				KEY:Chemist ~ Strafe Bomb								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:The chemist can throw bombs that splash in a 40-foot line rather than affecting a radius. The line starts at the chemist and extends away from him in the direction he chooses. The chemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the line to be the target of the bomb and makes his attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the line take splash damage. If the chemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive strafe bomb, the line of splash damage is 80 feet long instead of 40 feet.
Swift Alchemy			KEY:Chemist ~ Swift Alchemy							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:At 3rd level, a chemist can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes a chemist half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items
Alchemical Mixture		KEY:Chemist ~ Alchemical Mixture						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:At 4th level, a chemist can make a temporary alchemical item. As a standard action, a chemist can create an alchemical item from the tier 1 list from the alchemical item list at no cost. An alchemical item created this way only lasts for 1 round per chemist level before it loses all potency. The chemist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. At 11th level, a chemist can create an alchemical item from the tier 2 list. At 18th level, a chemist can create an alchemical item from the tier 3 list.
Anesthetic				KEY:Chemist ~ Anesthetic								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:At 5th level, a chemist learns how to supplement uses of the Heal skill with pain-killing drugs. He gains Skill Focus (Heal) as a bonus feat. Any use of the Heal skill that has a risk of harming the patient (such as extracting a barb) only deals the minimum damage when performed by a chemist.
Improved Quaff Potion		KEY:Chemist ~ Improved Quaff Potion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:At 7th level, the chemist can drink potions quickly. He can drink a potion as a move action instead of a standard action. The limitation to drinking potions increases by 1.
Mix					KEY:Chemist ~ Mix									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:At 9th level, as a full-round action, a chemist can mix two alchemical items together for a dual effect or create a new alchemical item of a higher tier. When creating a new alchemical item, the chemist must have two alchemical items of the same tier (1 or 2) which then creates any alchemical item of a higher tier. The chemist must make a Craft (alchemy) skill check (DC 20 for tier 1, DC 25 for tier 2, and DC 30 for tier 3) or both potions are ruined.
Auto-Potion				KEY:Chemist ~ Auto-Potion								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:At 11th level, the chemist can take an immediate action when hit by a melee attack or ranged attack to drink a potion.

Chocobo Mount			KEY:Chocobo Knight ~ Chocobo Mount							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Chocobo Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:A chocobo knight gains the service of a loyal and trusty yellow chocobo to carry him into battle. This chocobo functions as a beastmaster's animal companion, using the chocobo knight's level as his effective beastmaster level. A chocobo knight's mount does not gain the shared rage special ability. A chocobo knight does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat. A chocobo knight's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a chocobo knight's mount die, the chocobo knight may find another chocobo to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, improved evasion, or blood bond special abilities until the next time the chocobo knight gains a level.

The chocobo knight can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. Challenging a foe requires much of the chocobo knight's concentration. The chocobo knight takes a -2 penalty to his Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of his challenge. The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends.

Sense Good					KEY:Dark Knight ~ Sense Good								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:At will, a dark knight can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 30 feet and determine if it is good, with a successful Sense Motive skill check. The DC for an item is equal to 15 + the caster level of the item. The DC for an individual is equal to 15 + the CR of the creature.
Harm Touch					KEY:Dark Knight ~ Harm Touch								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:At 1st level, a dark knight surrounds his hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on those he touches. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 his dark knight level + his Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, a dark knight can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two dark knight levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, a dark knight can use this power to heal undead creatures, restoring 1d6 hit points for every two levels the dark knight possesses. Page 113 of 907
Smite Good					KEY:Dark Knight ~ Smite Good								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:Also at 1st level, once per day, a dark knight can call out to the dark powers to crush the forces of good. As a swift action, the dark knight chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is good, the dark knight adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack rolls and adds his dark knight level to all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good subtype, an good-aligned dragon, or a good creature with levels of white mage or holy knight, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the dark knight possesses. Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite good is in effect, the dark knight gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the dark knight targets a creature that is not good, the smite is wasted with no effect. The smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the dark knight rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the dark knight may smite good one additional time per day to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.
Dark Blessing				KEY:Dark Knight ~ Dark Blessing							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:At 2nd level, a dark knight applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.
Sneak Attack				KEY:Dark Knight ~ Sneak Attack							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:If a dark knight can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The dark knight's attack deals extra damage (called "precision damage") anytime his target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the dark knight flanks his target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 2nd level, and increases by 1d6 every four dark knight levels thereafter. Should the dark knight score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a dark knight can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. The dark knight must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A dark knight cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.
First Into Battle				KEY:Dark Knight ~ First Into Battle							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:At 2nd level, a dark knight can spend 1 use of smite good or harm touch to act in the surprise round, even if he is surprised. When the dark knight makes an Initiative check, he gains a bonus to the check equal to his Charisma bonus.
Shared Offense				KEY:Dark Knight ~ Shared Offense							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:At 3rd level, a dark knight can spend one use of his harm touch ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including other dark knights) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 profane bonus to their Attack and Damage rolls. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the dark knight's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points within this area become disabled instead of dying as in Diehard feat. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area deal an extra 1d6 points of damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25%% chance to deal sneak attack damage equal to the dark knight's sneak attack bonus. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area.
Defile					KEY:Dark Knight ~ Defile								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a dark knight can select one defile. Each defile adds an effect to the dark knight's harm touch ability. Whenever the dark knight uses harm touch to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the defilements possessed by the dark knight. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this defile. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the defile. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the dark knight's level + the dark knight's Charisma modifier. At 3rd level, the dark knight can select from the following initial defilements.
Blinded					KEY:Dark Knight ~ Blinded								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dark Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:The target receives the Blind status effect for 1 round per level of the dark knight.

The dragoon adds his dragoon levels to all Acrobatic skill checks for jumping. A dragoon's ability to jump with his Acrobatic checks is treated as though he got a running start and has the Run feat, regardless of whether or not he gets a running start. A dragoon's maximum height is not affected by his size, allowing very strong, very powerful dragoons to eventually leap higher than their own height. In addition, the dragoon may jump as part of a charge action. Beginning at 4th level, the DC multiplier for a high jump is reduced by 1, making it a multiplier of 3 rather than 4. This reduction improves by 1 every seven levels; multiplier of 2 at 11th level, and multiplier of 1 at 18th level. A dragoon using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity unless they pass through a square that is threatened by a flying creature that he is not attacking directly.

This extra damage is 1d6 when first gained, and it increases by 1d6 with each improvement. If the attack is also a critical hit, the extra damage is not also multiplied. For every 10 feet the dragoon jumps beyond the first 10 feet, the dragoons deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.

In addition, a dragoon can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a dragoon can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.

When first using this ability, the dragoon takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The dragoon's ability to absorb his fall improves with his dragoon level until at 20th level he can fall any distance without harm.
Dragoon Training				KEY:Dragoon ~ Dragoon Training							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragoon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.120	DESC:At 5th level a dragoon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with spears, lances, and polearms.

This limit break requires only swift Spells: A geomancer casts geomancy spells which are drawn the geomancer spell list. A geomancer begins play with 2 1st level geomancy spells of her choice. At each new geomancer level, she gains one new spell of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new geomancer level). Like most mages, a geomancer can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire. To learn or cast a spell, the geomancer must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a geomancer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the geomancer's Wisdom modifier. In addition, a geomancer gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Wisdom).

Geomancy Effects
Immobilize: Creatures affected by Immobilize may not voluntarily move from the spot on which they stand, although others may move them. Immobilize consumes one of the target's move actions for the round. They do not lose their Dexterity bonus to AC and are not considered helpless. For the duration of the effect, a creature affected may not use the skills Acrobatics, Climb, or Swim, or any other skills which require locomotion, as they have an effective speed of 0. If the creature affected was climbing or swimming when struck, it may make the appropriate check to remain in place. If this check fails, the creature affected immediately begins to fall or sink. If the affected creature is riding a mount, the mount also takes the effect of Immobilize, unless it is immune to mind-affecting abilities. If this is the case, the rider may continue to control the movement of the mount, but may not dismount for the duration of the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Frog: The targets are transformed into harmless frogs for the duration of the effect. The subject takes on all the statistics and special abilities of an average frog in place of its own except as follows:
	DESC:&nl;The target retains its own alignment (and personality, within the limits of the new form's ability scores).
	DESC:&nl;If the target has the shapechanger subtype, it retains that subtype.
	DESC:&nl;The target retains its own hit points.
	DESC:&nl;The target is treated has having its normal Hit Dice for purpose of adjudicating effects based on HD, such as the sleep spell, though it uses the new form's base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and all other statistics derived from Hit Dice.
	DESC:&nl;The target also retains the ability to understand (but not to speak) the languages it understood in its original form.
	DESC:With those exceptions, the target's normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form. The target loses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features. All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to frog, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the effect). This is a polymorphing effect.
# 130 of 907
Paralyze: A paralyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Not even friends can move his limbs. He may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with no components. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.
Petrify: The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this effect is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as deathwatch.
Confusion: This effect causes the targets to become confused, making them unable to independently determine what they will do. Roll on the following table at the beginning of each subject's turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.
# 131 of 907
Disable: A creature affected by Disable may take no action in a round except a single move action to move its speed. It also may not take attacks of opportunity or any other out-of-sequence actions. It does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC and is not considered helpless. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Sleep: Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Countdown: Countdown has a delayed effect. Onset is in 11 rounds minus the geomancer's Wisdom modifier, minimum 1 round. Until this duration has elapsed, dark tendrils of negative energy visibly play over the victim's body. During this time, the effect may be cured by esuna; the geomancer's level is considered to be the caster level. When the onset time elapses, the targeted creature immediately falls unconscious at -1 hit points. This is a death effect.
Blindness: The creature cannot see. He takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class, loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -4 penalty on Search checks and on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and Spot checks) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50%% miss chance) to the blinded creature. This effect only works on living creatures.
Silence: All sound is stopped for the creatures affected: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from them. Unlike the spell, this affects only the creature and not an area. The Silence affects all objects that are struck; magic items in a creature's possession that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance. This effect provides no defense against sonic or language-based attacks.
Slow: An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the geomancer (though she still can't see ethereal creatures and must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object).* Blindsight never allows a geomancer to distinguish color or visual contrast. She cannot read with blindsight.* Blindsight does not subject a geomancer to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).* Blinding attacks do not penalize a geomancer using her blindsight.* Deafening attacks thwart a geomancer's blindsight.* Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.* Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.

Whichever plane they choose, they become completely immune to all of the negative effects of the plane as if they were native to that plane and any spells that would be dampened because of the plane (Water spells in the Fire plane), are cast as normal spells by the geomancer. This ability can be switched, altering which plane the geomancer is acclimated to, every day, but it cannot be changed after she makes her decision for the day. In addition, regardless to which elemental plane the geomancer chooses, she cannot be banished by any means.

This dispels any concealment granted to any enemies within the area of effect and causes them to be afflicted with the Blind status effect for the duration of the limit break, a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half of holy knight's level + Charisma modifier) to negate this effect.

Using this ability is a standard action, unless the holy knight targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a holy knight only needs one free hand to use this ability. Alternatively, a holy knight can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the holy knight possesses.

In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the holy knight gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the holy knight targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect. The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the holy knight rests and regains her uses of this ability.

Double Illusion		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a free action while casting an illusion spell, an illusionist can spend 1 point from his veil pool to coil the illusion upon itself. Any creature that disbelieves the illusion sees a second illusion within the translucent outline of the first, as if the illusionist had cast the spell a second time. Effectively, after a creature disbelieves the first illusion, it sees a second illusion in its place, which it must attempt to disbelieve separately. The illusionist must determine the features of the second illusion as he casts the first. If the second illusion is especially similar to the first one, creatures that study or interact with it receive a +4 bonus on the save to disbelieve the effect.
Illusionary Penetration		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:An illusionist can spend 1 point from his veil pool as an immediate action to reroll a caster level check made to bypass spell resistance. He must use this ability before the results of the first roll are revealed, and must accept the second roll, even if it's worse.
Illusionary Reality		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a free action while casting an illusion spell of 1st level or higher, an illusionist can spend 1 point from his veil pool, at any time on his turn during that spell's duration, to choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion to become real. He must be able to take actions to do so, and the object remains real until the end of his next turn. The object he chooses can be of any size within the spell's area of effect (so, he can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for his allies to cross). The object cannot deal damage or otherwise directly harm another creature in any way.
Illusory Self		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As an immediate action, an illusionist can spend 2 points from his veil pool to create an illusory duplicate of himself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger (similar to mirror image).

True Veil		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:An illusionist can spend 1 point from his veil pool to imbue his disguise with a measure of reality. The illusionist's disguise self spell-like ability is treated as a polymorph effect, though it retains the illusion school. Other creatures no longer get a Will save to recognize the effect as an illusion, though they can still make Perception checks to realize the illusionist is using a disguise. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the illusionist's level.
Unfettered Concentration		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:An illusionist can spend 1 point from his veil pool to concentrate on an illusion as a swift action, rather than a standard action.
Social Cloaking		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, even when not actively trying to do so, an illusionist's identity is obscured by the falsehoods within which the character lives. As such, others find it difficult to conduct proper social interactions with the illusionist; situations always seem uncomfortable and off-putting at best or elusive at worst. All Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Sense Motive skill checks made concerning the illusionist suffer a -1 penalty. This penalty increases by -1 every three levels after 4th level. This same penalty is applied to the illusionist's leadership score if he has the Leadership feat.
Clear Vision		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A 4th-level illusionist is better able to see through illusions, granting a +2 bonus while making Disbelief saves. This bonus increases further by +2 at levels 8, 12 and 18.

Minor Illusion Esoterica		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, the illusionist's unflagging focus on illusions opens his mind to new possibilities and increases the save DCs of his illusion spells that have a saving throw entry of Will disbelief by 2.
Master of Disguise		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Such is a 7th-level illusionist's skill with disguises that he may gain one re-roll per session for a Disguise check that has been seen through, be the disguise illusory or mundane in nature.
Quick Veil		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 7th level, an illusionist can assume or alter his disguise with his veil pool ability as a move action. At 14th level, the action is reduced to a swift action.

DESC:At 9th level, any illusion spell the illusionist casts with a duration of concentration lasts a number of additional rounds equal to 1/2 of the illusionist's level after he stops maintaining concentration (minimum +1 round). At 20th level, the illusionist can make one illusion spell with a duration of concentration become permanent. The illusionist can have no more than one illusion made permanent in this way at one time. If he designates another illusion as permanent, the previous permanent illusion ends.
Moderate Illusion Esoterica		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 10th level, the illusionist's long study of illusions leads to a breakthrough. The illusionist gains concealment when he casts an illusion spell and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.
Clear Mind		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 10th level, an illusionist can regain his MP quicker. The illusionist must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. The illusionist regains MP equaling his Charisma modifier per hour.
Beguiling Aura		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 11th level, the illusionist can emit a 30-foot aura that beguiles his enemies with phantasmal assailants. Enemies within this aura must make a Will save (DC 10 + half of the illusionist's level + his Charisma modifier) or have to move at half speed, are unable to take attacks of opportunity, and are considered to be flanked. This is a mind-affecting effect. The illusionist can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his illusionist level + his Charisma modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
Illusionary Puppet		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 12th level, an illusionist can create a false image of himself that acts as though created by casting major image, although it will appear identical to the illusionist's current appearance. This appearance cannot be altered in any way except by altering the illusionist himself. So, to disguise the projected image the illusionist would need to be wearing a disguise. Similarly, any damage the illusionist suffers will appear, as if from nowhere, on the projected image. The image will stand still for that duration, requiring a DC 10 Concentration check as a swift action to do something simple, like move. Complex actions, such as speech with appropriate mannerisms or dancing requires a DC 15 (or higher) Concentration check with each action. If being used while the illusionist is involved in combat or spellcasting, increase the Concentration DC to control the image by +4. Events that otherwise cause a spellcaster to make a Concentration check are also needed at that same DC while manipulating an illusionary puppet image. If the Concentration check fails, the projected image does not disappear, however, but becomes immobile in the middle of whatever it was doing until a new Concentration check is made to get it under way again. The projected image has an AC of 10 + size modifier + Dex modifier. Successfully attacking the projected image does not cause it to dissipate, but will reveal it isn't

He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.
Doublecast		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Also at 15th level, once per day, an illusionist can take a full-round action to cast two spells. The illusionist pays MP for both spells as normal and if a concentration check is needed, he must check for both spells. He must also indicate the targets before spells are resolved.
Resilient Illusions		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 16th level, the illusionist's illusions are so lifelike that they defy disbelief. Anytime a creature tries to disbelieve one of the illusionist's illusion effects, make a caster level check.

DESC:At 18th level, three times per day, as a move action, an illusionist can reduce the cost of spells to 1 MP. Once activated, any spells the illusionist casts only cost 1 MP.

DESC:At 19th level, the illusionist can create an illusion that hides the appearance of himself and any number of allies within 30 feet for 1 round per illusionist level. This ability otherwise functions like the spell veil. The rounds do not need to be consecutive.
Bend Reality		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 20th level, an illusionist may disbelieve a real object making it an illusion. The object effectively become ethereal, and may be invisible or translucent. Objects cannot be larger than a 10 by 10 foot square. Unattended objects do not get a saving throw, but objects wielded, worn, or carried get a Fortitude save, (DC 20 + the illusionist's Charisma modifier) using the saves of the creature that the object is carried upon to be unaffected. The effect lasts for 1 minute. The illusionist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.

Defensive Stance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a knight can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trance-like determination. A knight can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like dwarf's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that the knight can maintain a defensive stance per day. The knight can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in a defensive stance, the knight gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The increase to Constitution grants the knight 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in a defensive stance, a knight cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the knight moves under his own power as a result of an enemy's successful use of the Bluff skill or spells, his stance ends.
The knight can end his defensive stance as a free action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A knight cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a knight falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death. A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the berserk spell).

If successful, the target suffers a -2 penalty on its attack rolls against the knight and a -2 penalty to AC on attacks made by the knight until the beginning of his next turn. At 13th level, a knight may use this ability as a swift action.
Fortification		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 9th level, a knight can use his armor to shield critical areas from injury. He treats any armor he wears as if it had the light fortification special ability. At 15th level, his armor gains the moderate fortification special ability. This fortification does not stack in any way with armor that has these special abilities. In these cases the knight takes the better of the two fortifications.
Stalwart		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 10th level, a knight can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If he makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.
Mobile Defense		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 11th level, a knight can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.
Advanced Knight Talents: At 12th level, and every two levels thereafter, a knight can choose one of the following knight advanced talents in place of a knight talent.
Aegis		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This talent doubles a knight's damage reduction against successful critical hits and sneak attacks. It also grants the knight a bonus to AC against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits. This bonus is equal to half the knight's level.
Daunting Challenge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This talent allows the knight to call out opponents, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies. In this manner, the knight separates the strong-minded from the weak-willed, allowing him to focus on opponents that are worthy foes. As a swift action, the knight issues a daunting challenge. This ability affects all creatures within 100 feet of the knight that have a CR less than his character level minus 2. Targets must be able to hear him, speak or understand a language of some sort, and have an Intelligence score of 5 or more. All targets who meet these conditions must make Will saves (DC 10 + half the knight's level + his Charisma modifier) or become shaken. Whether a creature fails or succeeds on its save against the knight's daunting challenge, it can only be targeted by this effect once per day.
Elemental Shield		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Some knights access mystic powers of protection as they become paragons of defensive techniques. With this talent, as a swift action, a knight with a shield equipped gains resistance 10 against earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, and wind damage. This resistance lasts for one round per knight level. The knight may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Constitution modifier (minimum 1/day). If the knight also has the resist talent, that resistance stacks with the elemental shield.
Impetuous Endurance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The knight's fighting spirit enables him to push his body beyond the normal limits of endurance. The knight no longer automatically fails a saving throw on a roll of 1. He might still fail the save if his result fails to equal or beat the DC.
# 153 of 907
Improved Take the Blow		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The knight's ability to absorb damage increases. Once per round, the knight can absorb all the damage from a single attack directed against an adjacent ally. In addition, he continues to absorb half the damage from other physical attacks on an adjacent ally, if he so choose. The knight must decide whether to use this ability after the attacker determines that an attack has succeeded but before he rolls damage. Prerequisites: Take the Blow
Improved Uncanny Block		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When the knight has a shield equipped, he cannot be flanked. This defense denies a thief the ability to sneak attack the knight by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more thief levels than the target has knight levels. Prerequisites: Uncanny Block
Last Word		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, while in a defensive stance, a knight can make one melee attack against an opponent within reach in response to an attack that would reduce him to negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him. For example, a knight has 1 hit point left when a fire dragon bites him; the knight may use this ability even if the dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as from Fire Materia), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally). Once the knight's attack is resolved, he suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this ability.
Mighty Resilience		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The knight automatically negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from Blinding Critical or bleed from sneak attack). The knight takes only normal damage from the attack. This power may only be used once per defensive stance.
Protect the Meek		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:With this talent, the knight can move to intercept foes. As an immediate action, he can move up to his speed (or his mount's speed, if mounted) and make a single melee attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The knight must end his movement adjacent to an enemy. On his next turn, the knight is staggered and cannot use this ability again for 1 round.
Reflect		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:With this talent, a knight can maximize the protection his armor gives him to reduce the damage area attacks deal him. A knight in medium or heavy armor takes only half damage from any attack, spell, or ability that allows a Reflex saving throw. The knight is still allowed a normal saving throw; he simply takes half of the damage he normally would base on the result of that saving throw. If the attack, spell, or ability has a non-damaging effect, the knight suffers the appropriate effect based on his saving throw result.
Retributive Attack		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:If an adjacent ally of a knight is rendered helpless or unconscious, the knight with this talent can make a retributive attack against the creature that felled his ally. When making a retributive attack, the knight adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per knight level on a successful hit. A knight can make a number of retributive attacks per day equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum of one), but never more than once per round. He may make more than one retributive attack against the same foe.
Shield Guard		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:With this talent, as a swift action, a knight may designate one square adjacent to him. He may designate two squares if using a heavy shield or three squares if using a tower shield, but these squares must be contiguous. Enemies in these squares cannot flank the knight and do not count for flanking with other creatures. This effect lasts until he moves from his position or uses another swift action to change the affected squares.
# 154 of 907
Unkillable		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The knight gains a number of hit points equal to 10 plus his Constitution score.
Counterattack		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, a knight can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who hits an ally under his Shield Ally ability with a melee attack, so long as the attacking creature is within the knight's reach.
Improved Shield Ally		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 14th level, the knight's ability to intercept attacks improves. The knight can now intercept spells with a touch or ranged touch on an adjacent ally.
Shield Guard		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 15th level, as a swift action, a knight may designate one square adjacent to him. He may designate two squares if using a heavy shield or three squares if using a tower shield, but these squares must be contiguous. Enemies in these squares cannot flank the knight and do not count for flanking with other creatures. This effect lasts until he moves from his position or uses another swift action to change the affected squares.
Improved Mobile Defense		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 17th level, a knight can move normally while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he may move up to his normal movement without losing the benefit of the stance.
Shield Ward		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 19th level, a knight gains evasion (as a thief) while wielding a shield, and adds his shield bonus to his AC (not including enhancement bonuses) on Reflex saves and to his touch AC. In addition, his shield cannot be disarmed or sundered.
Indestructible		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 20th level, a knight gains complete immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks while he is wearing armor. In addition, unless his armor has the fragile armor quality, it cannot be sundered while he is wearing it.
Ex-Knights
A knight who is no longer lawful loses all supernatural class features and may no longer advance in levels as a knight.

###Block - Monk Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training. The weapons with which a monk is proficient are club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling. Monks
# 156 of 907
are not proficient with any armor or shields-in fact, many of the monk's special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.
Limit Breaks		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the monk receives the Limit Break (Ki Blast and Perfect Self).
Ki Blast		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the monk to shoot a blast of force in a line up to 60 feet. It deals 1d6 points of non-elemental damage per monk level, a Reflex save (DC 10 + half of monk's level + Wisdom modifier) for half damage.
Perfect Self		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the monk to gain perfection in himself for a short period of time. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four monk levels, the monk gains a +1 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, and a damage reduction of 2/-. For every four monk levels, he gains an additional +1 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls, and damage reduction of 2/-. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Martial Arts		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. Monks are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes. A monk does not benefit from Improved Critical feat. Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would. A monk deals 1d4 points of damage with an unarmed strike. Also, she threatens a critical hit on a natural 20 when making an unarmed attack. Small races only deal 1d3 points of damage and large creatures deal 1d6 points of damage. A monk increases her unarmed strike damage and critical hit threat range at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level. At each intended level, the monk's unarmed strike damage increases by 1d4 (modified by size) and her critical hit threat range by 1.
AC Bonus		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A monk is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC and her CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.
These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
Flurry of Blows		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action.
When doing so, she may make one additional attack, taking a -2 penalty on all of her attack rolls, as if using the Two-Weapon Fighting feat. These attacks can be any combination of unarmed strikes and attacks with a monk special weapon (she does not need to use two weapons to utilize this ability).
For the purpose of these attacks, the monk's base attack bonus from her monk class levels is equal to her monk level. For all other purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, the monk uses her normal base attack bonus.
# 157 of 907
At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when she uses flurry of blows, as if using Improved Two-Weapon Fighting (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).
At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using flurry of blows, as if using Greater Two-Weapon Fighting (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).
A monk applies her full Strength bonus to her damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands. A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows. A monk cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. A monk with natural weapons cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can she make natural attacks in addition to her flurry of blows attacks.
Stunning Fist		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the monk can use Stunning Fist to force a foe damaged by her unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half her monk level + her Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before her next turn). A stunned character drops everything held, can't take actions, loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -2 penalty to AC. The monk may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to her monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels she has in classes other than monk, and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned. The monk must declare that she is using this ability before she makes her attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt).
At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of her Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect.
At 4th level, she can choose to make the target fatigued.
At 8th level, she can make the target sickened for 1 minute.
At 12th level, she can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds.
At 16th level, she can permanently blind or deafen the target.
At 20th level, she can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds.
The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature sickened by Stunning Fist cannot become nauseated if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.
Evasion		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level or higher, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Fists of Wind		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Also at 2nd level, as a swift action, a monk can harness the power of wind to quicken her strides. The monk gains additional movement speed equal to her Wisdom modifier x 5 feet for 1 minute. The monk can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier.
# 158 of 907
Martial Arts Style Mastery		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, a monk begins learning different martial arts styles based on animal fighting forms. The monk can choose between Ape, Bear, Bull, Panther, or Tiger. Each style has three tiers (Novice, Expert, and Master) and must be taken in order.
Ape Martial Arts Style		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The ape martial arts style's main focus is the ability to disable an opponent instead of killing him. This style focuses on punches, jabs, and throws.
Novice		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a practitioner of the ape martial arts style, a monk is sometimes forced to make that one attack count to end conflict. When you use the attack action, the monk may make a single unarmed attack against one opponent, adding two times her Strength bonus to damage.
Expert		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A monk of the ape martial arts style learns that the quickest way to down an opponent is to use her full strength in one blow. As a full-attack action, the monk can attempt to knock her target unconscious with an unarmed strike. If she scores a hit that deals damage and exceeds the target's AC by 10 or more, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds.
Master		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a master of the ape martial arts style, the monk can make a killing strike. Once per day, the monk may attempt to deal a killing blow to an opponent. She declares her intention to deal a killing blow, and then makes a normal unarmed attack roll. If she strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half of monk's level + Wisdom modifier) or die. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected.
Bear Martial Arts Style		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The brutal bear style is full of jabs, chops, kicks, and other quick and dangerous strikes, focusing on deadliness over finesse.
Novice		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a practitioner of the bear martial arts style, a monk learns to quickly take advantage of a fallen opponent. When a monk makes melee attacks against a prone target, she gains a +2 damage bonus (which is not multiplied on a crit) and increases the critical threat range of her attacks by 1 (for example, from 19-20 to 18-20).
Expert		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As an expert in bear martial arts, the monk is adept at making her most effective strikes even more potent. Any time the monk scores a threat on an unarmed attack, she gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll to confirm the critical hit.
Master		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a master in the bear martial arts style, the monk's knowledge of the bear style allows her to inflict deadly damage to grappled opponents. As a full-round action, the monk may attempt a single coup de grace attack on a character she has pinned in a grapple as though the target were helpless. She deals her maximum unarmed combat damage when making the coup de grace. If she fails to kill the target, he automatically escapes the grapple.
Bull Martial Arts Style		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The bull martial arts style is very physical, often bringing the combatants into close contact. Bull combat utilizes full-body tackles, throws, and full-arm blows, as well as the powerful jabs and snap kicks commonly used in instances where close combat is ineffective.
Novice		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a practitioner of the bull martial arts style, a monk is often quick to make a swift jab after making a charge. When executing a charge attack action while unarmed, the monk gains one additional attack, at a -5 penalty.
# 159 of 907
Expert		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Using the bull martial arts style, the monk can charge an opponent with great force. When the monk makes a successful unarmed attack against an opponent during a charge attack action, the monk's Strength bonus is doubled when calculating damage.
Master		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a master of the bull martial arts style, the monk can deal a devastating blow to an opponent. As a full-round action, instead of making a full attack, the monk may make a single unarmed attack against an opponent. If the attack is successful, she deals the maximum unarmed damage on the attack. For every 1 point of base attack bonus, she gains an additional +1 bonus on damage. (A 15th level monk would deal +11 points of damage to her unarmed attack.)
Panther Martial Arts Style		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The panther martial arts style is often practiced by monks in order to maximize damage to an opponent while minimizing the amount of noise made by the attack. It focuses on short, quick motions and emphasizes on stealth.
Novice		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a practitioner of the panther martial arts style, a monk learns to silent her unknowing opponents quietly with an unarmed strike. If the monk successfully hits a flat-footed opponent with an unarmed attack, the opponent is unable to speak or make any kind of noise with his vocal cords for 2d4 rounds; this includes shouting warnings or raising alarms. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + monk level + the monk's Wisdom modifier) reduces the number of rounds the victim is unable to speak by half (round down). Creatures immune to critical hits and creatures without vocal cords cannot be affected.
Expert		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The monk's knowledge of the panther style of fighting lets her disarm opponents with ease. The monk gains the +4 bonus on her combat maneuvers when attempting to disarm an opponent with an unarmed attack.
Master		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a master in the panther martial arts form, the monk may use an unarmed attack to attempt to daze an opponent. The monk must declare that she is using this ability before she makes her attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). It forces a foe damaged by her unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the monk's character level), in addition to dealing damage normally. If the defender fails his saving throw, he is dazed for 3 rounds. A dazed character can take no actions but can defend against attacks normally. The monk may attempt a daze attack once per level per day, and no more than once per round. Multiple daze attacks against the same creature do not stack (but the creature can be dazed again once the effect wears off). Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be dazed by the monk's panther mastery attack.
Tiger Martial Arts Style		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The tiger martial arts style focuses on power and strength, including varying levels of damage depending on the force that is applied to the attacks.
Novice		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a practitioner of the tiger martial arts style, the monk learns to put more power into his unarmed strikes to bypass damage reduction. Once per day, the monk may ignore an opponent's damage reduction when calculating damage of all her unarmed attacks for 1 round.
Expert		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The monk's knowledge of the tiger fighting style learns to block melee weapons with her bare hands. Once per round, when the monk has at least one hand free and is fighting unarmed, she can deflect one melee weapon attack that would normally hit her. She expends no action to deflect the attack, but she must be aware of it and not flat-footed. An attack so deflected deals no damage to her.
Master		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a master of the tiger martial arts style, the monk learns to pounce like a fierce tiger, raining down powerful unarmed strikes. The monk can charge at an opponent and make a full attack.

Fast Movement		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her land speed, as shown on the table above. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.
Maneuver Training		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, a monk uses her monk level in place of her base attack bonus when calculating her Combat Maneuver Bonus. Base attack bonuses granted from other classes are unaffected and are added normally.
Slow Fall		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.
Martial Arts Master		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, a monk may use her monk level to qualify for feats with a fighter level prerequisite when those feats are applied to unarmed strikes.
Ki Pool		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her monk level + her Wisdom modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she can make a ki strike.
	DESC:&nl;At 4th level, ki strike allows her unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character's monk level.
	DESC:&nl;At 7th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
	DESC:&nl;At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
	DESC:&nl;At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a monk can do one of the following:
	DESC:&nl;Make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack, or
	DESC:&nl;Increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round, or
	DESC:&nl;Give herself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round.
Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.
Leap from the Heavens		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, a monk adds her level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, she always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using Acrobatics. By spending 1 point from her ki pool as a swift action, a monk gains a +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round.
Aurablast		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 6th level, a monk can channel her Ki to emit a blast of pure chi at an enemy. As a standard action and a ranged touch attack, the monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool to throw a blast of ki at an enemy for 1d6 points of non-elemental damage per two monk levels attained.

Quick Learner (Minor)		KEY:Red Mage ~ Quick Learner (Minor)						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:At 2nd and 6th level, a red mage chooses one of the following abilities to add to his list of class features:
Spellstrike				KEY:Red Mage ~ Spellstrike								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:At 2nd level, whenever a red mage casts a single-target spell, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a red mage can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the red mage makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.
Armored Mage			KEY:Red Mage ~ Armored Mage								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:At 3rd level, normally, armor heavier than light armor interferes with a spell-caster's gestures, which can cause spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component.

This training does not extend to medium armor or to heavy shields. This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different spell-casting class. At 7th level, a red mage learns to use medium armor with no chance of spell failure. At 10th level, a red mage learns to use heavy shields with no chance of spell failure.

Unlike the other mages, a summoner cannot purchase or find scrolls to add spells to his spells known list, but he can learn new summon spells from another summoner.

Avatars are treated as summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their Constitution score. The summoner may only have one pact with a specific avatar. To change the summoner's pact, he must defeat an incarnation of the avatar he wishes to form a pact with (up to GM's discretion on how this comes about). Once the summoner gains the new pact, he loses the old pact.
A summoner can summon his avatar in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the avatar hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The avatar remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the summoner is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his avatar is immediately banished. The avatar's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the summoner's class level
# 181 of 907
and increase as the summoner gains levels. In addition, each avatar receives improvements, based on the summoner's level, which can be used to upgrade the avatar's abilities and powers.

Life Link		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level, a summoner forms a close bond with his avatar. Whenever the avatar takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, the summoner can, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the avatar. This can prevent the avatar from being sent back to its home plane.
In addition, the avatar and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the avatar to remain at full strength. If the avatar is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%%. If the avatar is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and
# 185 of 907
maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%%. If the avatar is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the avatar gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.
Summon Monster I		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call his avatar. As a result, he can only use this ability when his avatar is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard action and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 4th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 18th level). A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon monster immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part of his spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell completion items. In addition, he can expend uses of this ability to fulfill the construction requirements of any magic item he creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required spell.
Bond Senses		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a summoner can, as a standard action, share the senses of his avatar, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the avatar does. There is no range to this effect, but the avatar and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.
Shield Ally		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, whenever a summoner is within his avatar's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the avatar is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Maker's Call		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 7th level, as a standard action, a summoner can call his avatar to his side. The avatar must be within 120 feet. When used, the avatar appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the avatar is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the summoner's Charisma modifier.
Transposition		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 9th level, a summoner can use his maker's call ability to swap locations with his avatar. If it is larger than him, he can appear in any square occupied by the avatar. The avatar must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.
Clear Mind		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 10th level, a summoner can regain his MP quicker. The summoner must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. The summoner regains MP equaling his Charisma modifier per hour.
Greater Shield Ally		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 11th level, whenever an ally is within an avatar's reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the avatar is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Life Bond		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, a summoner's life becomes linked to his avatar's. As long as the avatar has 1 or more hit points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of that which would reduce the summoner to fewer than 0 hit points is instead transferred to the avatar. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the avatar is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like Statue, Doom, Death or other spells that do not cause actual damage.
# 186 of 907
Paragon Summons		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 15th level, three times per day, the summoner can take the maximum of all hit die of a single creature summoned when determining starting hit points. At 17th level and 19th level, the summoner can use this ability one additional time per day.
Superior Shield Ally		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 17th level, whenever an ally is within the avatar's reach, the ally receives a damage reduction of 2/-, in addition to the bonuses to AC and saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, the damage reduction increases to 5/-.
Merge Forms		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 19th level, as a full-round action, a summoner can touch his avatar and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the avatar (although durations continue to expire).
The summoner can cast spells while inside the avatar by taking control of the avatar for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the avatar's actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.
The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the avatar if able. If the avatar is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.
Twin Avatar		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 20th level, a summoner and his avatar share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his avatar, copying all of its abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his avatar. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his avatar. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.

###Block - Thief Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Thieves are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, shortbow, and shortsword. Thieves are proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.
Limit Breaks		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the thief receives the Limit Breaks (Perfect Dodge and Vanish).
Perfect Dodge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break makes the thief extremely agile. Any melee or range attacks automatically misses unless a natural roll of 20 is rolled, and even then, the critical threat is unconfirmed unless another natural roll of 20 is rolled. Any spells that require a Reflex saving throw are automatically made. This lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four thief levels. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Vanish		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break makes the thief invisible for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four thief levels. While invisible, the thief can make attacks as normal and remain invisible. The thief also receives a +1d6 sneak attack bonus + an additional 1d6 per four thief levels while under the this Limit Break. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Sneak Attack: If a thief can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.
The thief's attack deals extra damage (called "precision damage") anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the thief flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two thief levels thereafter. Should the thief score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.
With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a thief can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.
The thief must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A thief cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.
Trapfinding: A thief adds 1/2 her level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A thief can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A thief who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.
Mark		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, this ability grants the thief a +2 competence bonus on any Perception checks made to determine what sort of items and equipment a person or creature may be wearing. It also allows the thief to make the Perception check as a free action.
Evasion		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level, a thief can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the thief is wearing light armor, or no armor. A helpless thief (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Trap Sense		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level, a thief gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These
# 189 of 907
bonuses rise to +2 when the thief reaches 5th level, to +3 when she reaches 8th level, to +4 when she reaches 11th level, to +5 at 14th, increases to +6 at 17th level, and advances to +7 at 20th level.
Thief Talents: As a thief gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a thief gains one thief talent. She gains an additional thief talent at 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level. A thief cannot select an individual talent more than once. Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a thief's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.
Acrobatic Charge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent may make an Acrobatics check to move through a threatened area or an opponent's square as part of a charge. He may also change direction once during a charge.
Assault Leader		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When the thief misses with a sneak attack on an opponent, she can designate a single ally who is adjacent of the target that her attack missed. That ally can make a single melee attack against the opponent as an immediate action.
Befuddling Strike*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When the thief deals sneak attack damage against an opponent, that opponent takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls against the thief for 1d4 rounds.
Bleeding Attack*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the thief's sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.
Camouflage		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, a thief with this talent can craft simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The thief needs 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is good for the rest of the day or until the thief fails a saving throw against an area effect spell that deals earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind damage, whichever comes first. The thief gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks while within terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage.
Canny Observer		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When a thief with this talent makes a Perception check to hear the details of a conversation or to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps), she gains a +4 bonus.
Charmer		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the thief can roll two dice while making a Diplomacy check, and take the better result. She must choose to use this talent before making the Diplomacy check. A thief can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 thief levels she possesses.
Coax Information		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent can use Bluff or Diplomacy in place of Intimidate to force an opponent to act friendly toward her.
Combat Swipe: A thief who selects this talent gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat.
Combat Trick: A thief that selects this talent gains a bonus combat feat (see Feats).
Convincing Lie		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When a thief with this talent lies, she creates fabrications so convincing that others treat them as truth. When a thief with this talent successfully uses the Bluff skill to convince someone that what
# 190 of 907
she is saying is true, if that individual is questioned later about the statement or story, that person uses the thief's Bluff skill modifier to convince the questioner, rather than his own. If his Bluff skill modifier is better than the thief's, the individual can use his own modifier and gain a +2 bonus on any check to convince others of the lie. This effect lasts for a number of days equal to 1/2 the thief's level + the thief's Charisma modifier.
Cunning Trigger		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent can use a swift action to set off any trap within 30 feet that she constructed.
Deft Palm		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent can make a Sleight of Hand check to conceal a weapon while holding it in plain sight, even while she is being observed.
Disease Use: A thief with this talent can apply filth from garbage, a sewer, a city street, a polluted area, or long-unwashed clothing or fur to a weapon as a standard action. Doing so causes the weapon to inflict filth fever on its next strike. The thief does not risk exposure to this disease unless she is damaged by the weapon. After a successful attack with the weapon, the filth is dispersed and must be reapplied.
Distracting Attack*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent can make sneak attacks with subtle flourishes that disorient and distract her enemy. When she hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo the additional damage to cause the creature to become flat-footed against one target of her choosing until the beginning of her next turn. The thief cannot designate herself as the creature gaining the benefit of this talent. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to distracting attack.
Esoteric Scholar		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once a day, a thief with this talent may attempt a Knowledge check, even when she is not trained in that Knowledge skill.
Expert Leaper		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When making jump checks, the thief is always considered to have a running start. Also, when the thief deliberately falls, a DC 15 Acrobatics check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen, instead of the first 10 feet.
Face in the Crowd		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent can blend into groups easily. Opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks take a -2 penalty when made against the thief's Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth checks if she's within 30 feet of at least two non-hostile characters of her apparent creature type. This penalty increases to -4 if she's within 30 feet of at least eight such creatures or is currently in a square occupied by a crowd.
False Friend		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent gains a +4 bonus when making Bluff checks to convince someone she has never met or who doesn't know her well that they are previously acquainted or know each other well.
Fast Fingers		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent can roll two dice while making a Sleight of Hand check and take the better result.

Mug		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Defensive Roll		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:With this advanced talent, the thief can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the thief can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the thief must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the thief's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

If the attack succeeds, the thief deals weapon damage as normal, but instead of the thief dealing sneak attack damage, the target is knocked prone and is unable to take move actions during its next turn. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the thief's level + the thief's Dexterity modifier) negates this effect.
Hard Minded		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent is hard to fool with mind-affecting effects. At the start of her turn, if she is still subject to any mind-affecting spells or effects, she can make a Will saving throw with a standard DC for the effect's level, and if she succeeds at the check, she is no longer subject to the mind-affecting effect. She can make this saving throw even against mind-affecting effects that normally don't allow a saving throw. In those cases, generate the saving throw as if the spell or effect did allow a saving throw.
Hunter's Surprise		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, a thief with this talent can designate a single enemy she is adjacent to as her prey.

Knock-Out Blow		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the thief can forgo her sneak attack damage to attempt to knock out an opponent. She must declare the use of knock-out blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage, but instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and instead of any effect that triggers when the thief deals sneak attack damage), the target falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this effect to staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the thief's level + the thief's Intelligence modifier.

The DC of the concentration check is equal to 10 + the spell's level + twice the number of sneak attack dice the thief possesses.

DESC:Once per round, the thief can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character.

DESC:Once per day, when a thief with this talent is hit with a melee attack, she can redirect the attack to strike at an adjacent creature with a free action. The creature targeted must be within melee reach of the attack that hit the thief, and the creature that made the attack against the thief must make a new attack roll against the new target.
Skill Mastery: The thief becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A thief may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for skill mastery to apply to each time.

DESC:A thief with this talent can spend a swift action to attempt to make an opponent act like an ally for purposes of providing a flank until the beginning of the thief's next turn. The opponent must be able to hear and see the thief, and the thief must succeed at a Bluff check opposed by the opponent's Sense Motive. If the check succeeds, the opponent acts as an ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or not the check succeeds, the thief cannot use this trick again on the same opponent for the next 24 hours. If the thief fails the check by 5 or more, she cannot use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within line of sight of the failed attempt for 24 hours.
Weapon Snatcher		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A thief with this talent can make a Sleight of Hand check in place of a disarm check when attempting to disarm an opponent.
# 199 of 907
Skirmisher		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, whenever a thief moves more than 10 feet in a round and makes an attack action, the attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target was flat-footed. If the thief makes more than one attack this turn, this ability only applies to the first attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability.
Theft Mastery		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 15th level, the thief can take 10 on Sleight of Hand skill checks even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.
Hide in Plain Sight		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 17th level, the thief can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.
Shadow Step		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 19th level, as a move action, the thief can step into the shadows and appear out of a shadow within 30 feet.
Master Strike		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Upon reaching 20th level, a thief becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the thief deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a Fortitude save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the thief's level + the thief's Intelligence modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is made, that creature is immune to that thief's master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.

###Block - Time Mage Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Time mages are proficient with the club, sling, power rod, power staff, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Heavier armor interferes with a time mage's movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.
Limit Breaks		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the time mage receives the Limit Breaks (Foresight and Temporal Stasis).
Foresight		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break grants the time mage a powerful temporal sixth sense in relation to himself. The time mage receives instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four time mage levels, the time mage can't be surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the limit break gives the time mage a general idea of what action the character might take to best protect himself (duck, jump right, close the eyes, and so on) and gives the time mage a +2 insight bonus to AC and to Reflex saves. This bonus improves by 2 per four time mage levels. This insight bonus is lost whenever the time mage would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC.
# 201 of 907
Temporal Stasis		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the time mage to escape into a temporal stasis where he phases from normal time for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four time mage levels. While in this stasis, the time mage cannot perform any action except watch the time go by. He is also unaffected by any spells or effects while in temporal stasis. Enemies and allies alike cannot perceive or detect him. The time mage can cancel his Limit Break before the duration ends.
Spells: A time mage casts time magic spells which are drawn the time mage spell list. A time mage begins play with 2 1st level time mage spells of his choice. At each new time mage level, he gains one new spell of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new time mage level). Like most mages, a time mage can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to his repertoire.
To learn or cast a spell, the time mage must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Int 11 for 1st-level spells, Int 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a time mage's spell is 10 + the spell level + the time mage's Intelligence modifier. In addition, a time mage gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Intelligence).
Spell Proficiency		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Time mages are considered to have the Precise Shot feat while casting spells or using any magical items that require ranged touch.
Cantrips: Time mages learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume MP and may be used again. Time mages begin with 4 0-level spells and gain an additional 0-level spell every three levels after 1st level.
Temporal Hiccup		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, a time mage is able to cause a temporal hiccup to reroll a single action (e.g., attack roll, skill check, or saving throw). A time mage can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligencer modifier as an immediate action.
Motes of Time		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A mote is a tiny split-second of time that a time mage steals from his own future. The motes taken are inconsequential slivers of continuance that even the time mage will not notice being missing from his activities. However, a time mage can use these motes to affect his present timeline, allowing him to re-try actions and slow down time around him so he can act more carefully and alertly in fast-moving situations.
Each day, the time mage has a pool of motes equal three plus his class level. Once a round, as a free action, a time mage can expend a mote to do any one of the following things:
	DESC:&nl;Gain a bonus to one attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. The roll must represent a single action that occurs entirely within a single round. (A time mage could use a mote to add a bonus to an Acrobatics check to leap over a chasm, but not to a Craft check made to determine how much progress was made after a day of work.) The bonus gained is equal to +1d4. This increases to +2d4 at 8th level, and +3d4 at 16th level. The time mage can decide to add this bonus immediately after seeing the result of the original die roll.
	DESC:&nl;Take a swift action that does not count against the time mage's normal limit of one swift action per round.
	DESC:&nl;Act in the surprise round when the time mage would not normally be able to do so.
At 3rd level, a time mage gains the ability to add the bonus from spending a mote of time to a single damage roll, or to his armor class (as a dodge bonus) until the beginning of his next turn.
# 202 of 907
At 7th level, the time mage may spend a mote to reduce the duration of any negative condition or effect he is suffering. By accelerating the speed with which only the negative influences on his travel through time, the time mage can reduce the duration of any one condition, affliction, or spell effect by 1d6 rounds (to a minimum of 0). This increased to a 2d6 round reduction at 15th level.
At 11th level, the time mage may spend a mote to take a move action as a swift action.
At 19th level, the time mage may use a mote to grant any ally within 60 feet that he can see an additional move action on that ally's next turn.
A time mage may gain additional options for use of a mote by taking temporal talents, though he is still restricted to spending motes only once each round.
Ahead of Time: At 2nd level, the time mage's growing control over time grants him an additional +2 bonus to initiative rolls. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by the improved initiative feat.
Quickening		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, a time mage is able to speed his internal processes to a remarkable rate. The time mage is considered to have Haste (as the spell) cast upon himself until canceled. This ability is a swift action that can be activated for a duration equal 1 round per time mage level + his Constitution modifier. The rounds does not need to be consecutive. A time mage can end his quickening as a free action and is fatigued afterwards for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the quickening.
Temporal Precognition		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, the time mage gains the ability to see small instances of the future, and gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, or saving throws. At the beginning of each round, he can choose where to apply his insight bonus to, and this bonus applies to any actions related to his choice until the end of the round. This insight bonus increases by 1 for every four levels after 4th.
Temporal Talents: As a time mage gains experience, he learns a number of talents that aid him and confound his foes. Starting at 2nd level, a time mage gains one temporal talent. He gains an additional temporal talent every even level except 20. A time mage cannot select an individual talent more than once.
Talents marked with an asterisk require a time mage to spend motes, which he may do only once per round. The evasion talent is not marked with an asterisk because its use does not require the use of a mote, despite the fact that it does allow a time mage to spend a mote to enhance its effect.
Evasion		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the time mage is wearing no armor. A helpless time mage does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A time mage with this talent can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a thief the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more levels in a class that grants sneak attack than the time mage's class level. If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level in a class that grants sneak attack required to flank the character. A time mage must already have uncanny dodge from some source before selecting this talent.
Old Wounds*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, the time mage can channel time into a wound, causing it to experience rapid healing, as if many days had passed. The time mage may spend a mote to heal his own wounds, or the
# 203 of 907
wounds of an ally touched. The wounds heal for 1d8 damage + 1 per class level of the time mage. This ability increase by an additional 1d8 every 4 levels to a maximum of 5d8.
Prescient Attack*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage may spend a mote as an immediate action after hitting a target with a weapon, ranged touch, or touch attack, allowing him to anticipate his opponent's defenses. The target is denied its Dexterity bonus against the time mage's attacks until the end of the time mage's next turn.
Prescient Defense*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage may spend a mote as an immediate action after hitting a target with a weapon, ranged touch, or touch attack, granting him a premonition of his enemy's intentions. The time mage gains a bonus to his AC and on Reflex saves equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) against attacks by that opponent until the beginning of his next turn.
Steady Hand*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can rewind time by small amounts to erase any minor mistakes he makes as a result of distraction around him. By spending a mote, the time mage may use skills reliably even under adverse conditions. Once he spends the mote, he may take 10 on any single skill check made before the end of his next round, even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so.
Steal Fate*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, the time mage can attempt to steal a crucial moment from a target's future, reducing the chance the target will enjoy a happy and prosperous future. The time mage spends a mote and the target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the time mage's level + the time mage's Intelligence modifier) or suffer a penalty to all attack and damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. This effect lasts for 1 round per time mage level. The penalty suffered is equal to -1, and increases to -2 at 8th level, and -3 at 16th level, while the time mage gains this as a bonus as he uses the stolen fate to carefully plan each action he takes. Steal Fate has a range of 30 feet.
Steal Time*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, with this talent, a time mage can steal time from a target. The time mage spends a mote and the target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the time mage's level + the time mage's Intelligence modifier) or suffer a penalty to AC, Reflex saves, and movement speed. This effect lasts for 1 round per time mage level. The penalty suffered is equal to -1 to AC and Reflex saves as well as a -5 foot movement speed, and increases to -2 and -10 foot at 8th level, and -3 and -15 at 16th level, while the time mage gains this as a bonus as he uses the stolen time to move quickly. Steal Time has a range of 30 feet.
Uncanny Dodge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A time mage with this talent can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A time mage with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.
Aevum		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, the time mage gains the ability to control aevum-distinct moments of important time, stolen from the future and used to power the time mage's abilities. Unlike a mote, which is a very minor split second of time, an aevum is a more noteworthy moment, a crucial instance when something important happened. While a time mage has a ready supply of motes to spend on minor effects, aevum represent more major manipulations of time and are thereby a rarer commodity.
When first gained, the time mage must select a single power from the list below, and has a single aevum per day to spend. He gains additional aevum powers at 9th, 13th, and 17th level, and also increases his daily aevum pool by +1 at each of the levels. Spending an aevum is a standard action unless the ability description says otherwise.
Bolt Time		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By spending an aevum, the time mage can accelerate his movements to a speed that allows him to easily see and react to the movement of a crossbow bolt or other projectile as it flies toward a target. The time
# 204 of 907
mage remains in bolt time for one round per class level. This ability counts as a haste effect. While in bolt time, the time mage gains the following benefits:
	DESC:&nl;Once per round, the time mage can cast a 1st level spell as a swift action. Every four levels thereafter, the time mage can cast a spell of one higher spell level as a swift action.
	DESC:&nl;The time mage gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves.
	DESC:&nl;All of the time mage's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice his normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus and it affects the time mage's jumping distance as normal for increased speed.
	DESC:&nl;Each round, the time mage may automatically dodge the first ranged attack he is aware of that would otherwise strike him.
Entropy		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can force a target to suddenly feel the effects of aging, which damages and weakens it. He spends an aevum and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action against any target he can see within 100 ft. + 10 ft./time mage level. If he hits the target, it takes 1d8 points of damage per class level of the time mage (to a maximum of 15d8). This damage bypasses hardness and DR.
Personal Time		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can take risky actions and, if things go badly, simply reverse his personal timeline to before he made the effort. At the beginning of his turn, the time mage spends an aevum as a free action. He then takes one normal round of actions, with all results noted temporarily. After his round of activity, before the next creature's turn begins, the time mage must decide if he is going to keep the round of activity he just took, or rewind himself.
If he keeps the round of activity, any changes made to any character during his turn become permanent. If he decides to reverse his timeline, he goes back to the moment he spent the aevum, and all changes that occurred during his round are erased from all creatures and items. The time mage is left with a standard action, but is considered to have spent an aevum and made use of his move action already. No one but the time mage remembers actions that took place during a round of time he reverses. If a time mage is killed or knocked unconscious during a round of personal time, he automatically reverses back to the beginning of his turn.
Shatter Time		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can break up the bigger, more important moments of stolen time under his control into smaller, more easily manipulated pieces. By spending an aevum, the time mage can recharge his daily uses of motes. He regains a number of motes of time equal to 1d4 + his Intelligence modifier. This cannot increase the number of motes available to above his daily mote total.
Temporal Stasis		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the time mage can spend an aevum to attempt to inflict temporal stasis (as the spell of the same name) on one touched creature. The time mage uses his class level as his caster level for this ability. If the time mage's initial touch attack fails, he can attempt this again as a standard action until he succeeds or six rounds pass. Once she successfully touches a target he loses the ability to try again, even if the target makes its Fortitude save. A time mage must be at least 17th level to select this aevum ability.
Time Cross		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can focus his timeline-stealing powers on a target, and steal from it a moment of success. He spends an aevum to make a ranged touch attack against any target he can see within 100 ft. + 10 ft./time mage level. If the time mage misses with this ranged attack he can try again (with each new attempt being its own standard action) for up to one minute per level. Once a target is hit, as an immediate reaction, the time mage can force the target to re-roll a single attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or saving throw he is aware of that occurs while the time cross is active (a time period equal to one minute per time mage level). The
# 205 of 907
target must take the result of the second roll. After the target re-rolls once, the ability is discharged regardless of the outcome of the re-roll.
Time Stop		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the time mage can spend an aevum to create a time stop effect (as the spell of the same name) on himself. A time mage must be at least 17th level to select this aevum ability.
Immunity to Slow		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Also at 6th level, a time mage's power of time makes him immune to Slow status effect.
Temporal Attunement		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 7th level, a time mage is able to manipulate time with spells or effects in relation to himself. Any spells or effects with a duration can be halved or doubled. A time mage must know or identify the spell or effect being cast upon him. A time mage can only attune himself to one spell or effect per round as an immediate action. This can also be used with the Quickening ability.
Foretell		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 8th level, the time mage can utter a prediction of the immediate future. While his foretelling is in effect, he emits a 30-foot aura of fortune that aids his allies or hinders his enemies, as chosen by the time mage at the time of prediction. If he chooses to aid, the time mage and his allies gain a +1 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If he chooses to hinder, his enemies take a -1 penalty on those rolls instead. The bonus/penalty increases by 1 for every four levels after 8th level. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his time mage level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
Advanced Temporal Talents: Beginning at 12th level, a time mage adds the following advanced temporal talents to his choices when picking a new temporal talent. Many advanced talents require a time mage to spend two of his daily uses of his mote of time ability. This still qualifies as spending a mote once during his turn, even though multiple motes are spent.
Back to the Future*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can spend two motes to fling himself briefly into the future to observe the results of proposed acts or decisions in his present. Since the time mage is only in his future for a moment, he is not certain to receive meaningful information. The base chance for receiving meaningful information is 70%% + 1%% per class level. This roll is made secretly by the GM. If the ability succeeds, the time mage gets one of the following four results:
	DESC:&nl;Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
	DESC:&nl;Woe (for bad results)
	DESC:&nl;Weal and woe (for both).
	DESC:&nl;Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).
If the ability fails, the time mage gets the nothing result. There is no way to tell if a nothing result is the consequence of an action with no particular results or a failed use of this ability. This ability can see into the future only about ten minutes per level of the time mage, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All efforts to use this ability by the same person about the same topic use the same die result as the first use of the ability.
Butterfly Effect*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a reaction, the time mage can make minor changes in his past, which creates a cascade of minor changes in the timeline to generate brief favorable circumstances for an ally in his present. The time mage can spend two motes to add a bonus to one attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw
# 206 of 907
made by an ally within 30 feet. The roll must represent a single action that occurs entirely within a single round. (A time mage could use a mote to add a bonus to an ally's Acrobatics check to leap over a chasm, but not to his Craft check made to determine how much progress was made after a day of work.) The bonus gained is equal to +2d4. This increased to +3d4 at 16th level. The time mage can decide to add this bonus immediately after seeing the result of the original die roll.
Dj Vu*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By spending two motes, a time mage can draw information from his future or past, allowing him to instantly gain the benefits of considerable study and reflection. He can even peer briefly into the future to see how others react to his various attempts at negotiation or subterfuge. The time mage can make a single Intelligence-, Wisdom- or Charisma-based skill check with a result equal to 20 + his total skill bonus. A time mage must take steady hand before he can take dj vu.
Improved Evasion		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This works like evasion, except that while the time mage still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless time mage does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
Quickened Magic		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can cast one spell per day as if it were modified by the Quicken Spell feat. This does not increase the MP cost of the spell.
Retroactive*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By spending two motes, a time mage can attempt the same physical action over and over, hopping back to his starting point each time if things don't work out for him. The time mage can make a single Strength-, Dexterity- or Constitution-based skill check with a result equal to 20 + his total skill bonus. A time mage must take steady hand before he can take retroactive.
Time After Time		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage gains advanced ability to manipulate time. The time mage may now spend motes twice per round, if he wishes.
Time Bandit		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage's access to motes increases. The time mage can spend an additional number of motes per day equal to his Intelligence modifier. This talent may be taken more than once, adding the same number of additional motes per day each time it is selected.
Time Runner*		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The time mage can move briefly through time, taking an action that does not exist in the normal sequence of reality. The time mage spends two motes to gain an additional move action. The time mage does not set off traps during this move action (though he may cause them to be triggered if, at the end of his run, the proper triggering situation still exists). He does not provoke attacks of opportunity during this move action, nor may other characters make Perception checks to notice the time mage during this move action. After the move action time catches up to the time mage, allowing triggered traps to go off and other creatures to immediately notice the time mage where he now stands.
Immunity to Countdown and Doom		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 14th level, a time mage's superior manipulation of time makes him immune to Countdown and Doom spells and effects.
Immunity to Stop		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 17th level, a time mage's mastery of time makes him immune to Stop status effect.
Time Wizard		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The ultimate expression of the time mage's power is the ability to eliminate time and age from his personal time line. The time mage no longer ages physically, preventing him from dying of age or suffering any reduction to his ability scores due to age. If he is older than middle age for his race he reverts to a physical form at the prime of his health, gaining back any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution lost due to aging. He is now immune to age effects.
# 207 of 907
Additionally, the time mage's daily pool of aevum increases by an amount equal to his Intelligence modifier, and can spending aevum now counts as a move action (unless a power specifies otherwise). The time mage can spend a maximum of two aevum in a single round.

###Block - White Mage Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: White Mages are proficient with the club, sling, power rod, power staff, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Heavier armor interferes with a white mage's movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.
Limit Breaks		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the white mage receives the Limit Breaks (Breath of the Earth and Healing Wind).
Breath of the Earth		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break causes the earth to rupture partially and releases a warm wind encompassing you and your allies within 30 feet, curing any negative status effects and providing a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against status effects per four white mage levels for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four white mage levels.
Healing Wind		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break causes a cooling wind to ripple through you and your allies within 30 feet, healing for 2d10 points of damage + an additional 2d10 per four white mage levels and providing a Fast Healing 1 that increases by +1 per four white mage levels for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four white mage levels.
Spells: A white mage casts white magic spells which are drawn the white mage spell list. A white mage begins play with 2 1st level white mage spells of her choice. At each new white mage level, she gains one new spell of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new white mage level). Like most mages, a white mage can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire.
To learn or cast a spell, the white mage must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a white mage's spell is 10 + the spell level + the white mage's Wisdom modifier. In addition, a white mage gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Wisdom).
White Magery: At 1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, a white mage increases her power with her spells. At each such opportunity, she can choose from the list of the following (with a limit of 2 per):
Healing Mastery: This increases the white mage's caster level by 1 for all spells with a healing descriptor.
# 209 of 907
Increased Healing: This increases any healing spell the white mage casts by 1 extra die of the appropriate type. This allows the white mage to overcome any healing cap a spell might restrict her to.
Spell Mastery: This increases the DC for all of the white mage's spells by 1.
Spell Penetration: This increases the white mage's caster level checks by 1 made to overcome a creature's spell resistance. This stacks with the Spell Penetration feat.

Holy Burst		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.

The amount of holy damage dealt or damage healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two white mage levels beyond 2nd (2d6 at 4th, 3d6 at 6th, and so on). Undead creatures that take damage from holy burst receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the white mage's level + the white mage's Wisdom modifier. Creatures healed by holy burst cannot exceed their maximum hit point total-all excess healing is lost. A white mage may use holy burst a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A white mage can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.
Mage Talents: As a white mage gains experience, she learns a number of talents that assist her in manipulating spells and other forms of magic. At 2nd level, 5th level, and again at 8th level, a white mage gains one mage talent. A white mage cannot select an individual talent more than once.

Advanced Mage Talents: At 11th, 14th, and 17th level, a white mage learns further talents to assist her in manipulating spells and other forms of magic. She may gain one of the abilities described in the Mage Talents entry or, if she prefers, one of the abilities described below. Advanced mage talents follow the same rules as mage talents.
Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a white mage's spellcasting ability. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual spell and the decision must be made before the spell is cast.
Augment Spell*: Any spell the white mage knows that has a variable that increases by caster level which has a maximum, that maximum is increased by the equivalent of one additional caster level. Thus a white mage with this talent heals a maximum of 1d6+6 hit points with cure, and deals a maximum of 11d4 holy damage with holy.
Effortless Healing		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The white mage has learned to cast healing spells with minimal effort. She may cast such spells without provoking attacks of opportunity.

###Block - Black Belt Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A black belt is proficient with all simple weapons plus any weapons with the "monk" special feature. She is not proficient with any armor or shields.
Limit Break		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the black belt receives the Limit Breaks (Hundred Fists and Unstoppable).
Hundred Fists		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the black belt to unleash a secret martial technique. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four black belt levels, every attack the black belt makes (including attacks made with weapons), she may make a separate unarmed attack at the same iterative attack bonus against the same target, provided they are valid targets for unarmed attacks. These additional attacks can be made any time a black belt rolls an attack roll that would result in direct damage. This includes attacks of opportunity or extra attacks from master's flurry as well as haste effects that grant an additional attack. Attack rolls that would not directly result in damage, such as a touch attack to begin a grapple, do not allow for these extra attacks. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Unstoppable		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the black belt through sheer force of will to pull from a vast well of untapped energy, creating a nearly unstoppable force in battle. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four black belt levels, the black belt acts if under Freedom of Movement and becomes immune to all fear and charm effects as well as any spells or conditions which would limit the black belt's actions, as defined by any state that limits her ability to take normal move, swift, and standard actions each round. If the black belt is already under an effect or spell which limits her movements or actions, those effects end as if they were immediately removed or expired. Ability score penalties and damage do not affect the black belt in this state, and movement penalties for difficult terrain are ignored. If a black belt drops to -1, she is considered to have the Diehard feat. If a black belt is dropped below negative hit points equal to her Constitution score during this duration, she may roll a Fortitude save equal to 10 + her negative hit point value to retain her ability to act normally. A new save is rolled each time damage is received using her new negative hit point value (IE: a black belt with a 10 Constitution is at -10 hit points must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save to remain standing, and if damaged again to -17 hit points, a DC 27 Fortitude save to stave off death once again). If Unstoppable ends with the black belt having negative hit points equal to her Constitution score, she immediately dies. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Martial Cunning		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:If the black belt's Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.
# 215 of 907
Shrug It Off		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level, a black belt's body are regularly subjected to punishment and stress from various and diverse sources. This training leads to the point where she can convert part of the damage she receives into nonlethal damage. At 2nd level, the amount of lethal damage equal to her black belt's level plus her Constitution modifier from any source can be placed into their Shrug It Off damage pool. This damage counts as normal toward the black belt's nonlethal damage accrual.
Any time the black belt heals nonlethal damage, it is always healed from this pool first. If the black belt takes more damage than can be placed into their Shrug It Off pool, the runoff amount simply stays as lethal damage and is treated as normal.
The total amount of damage that can be converted increases by 5 at 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels.
Martial Flexibility		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A black belt can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn't possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The black belt must meet all the feat's prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her black belt level (minimum 1). The black belt can use this ability again before the duration expires in order to replace the previous combat feat with another choice. If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit.
At 6th level, a black belt can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.
At 10th level, a black belt can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.
At 12th level, a black belt can use this ability to gain the benefit of one combat feat as an immediate action or three combat feats as a swift action. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.
At 20th level, a black belt can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.
Martial Training		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, a black belt counts her total black belt levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as Stunning Fist and a monk's robe). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely Stunning Fist.
Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, a black belt gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A black belt may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a black belt may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A black belt applies her full Strength modifier (not half) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.
Usually, a black belt's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.
# 216 of 907
A black belt's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.
A black belt also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than others, as shown on the table below. The unarmed damage values listed on that table are for Medium black belts. A Small black belt deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large black belt deals more damage; see the following table.

Master's Flurry		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a black belt can make a master's flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a black belt has the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes or weapons with the "monk" special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.
A black belt applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with master's flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A black belt can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of master's flurry. A black belt with natural weapons can't use such weapons as part of master's flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her master's flurry attacks.
At 8th level, the black belt gains use of the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using master's flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat when using master's flurry.
Maneuver Training		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, a black belt can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.
At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the black belt becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a black belt chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)
AC Bonus		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, when a black belt wears no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels. These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing any armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load.
# 217 of 907
Knockout		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, once per day, a black belt can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the black belt hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the black belt's level + the higher of the black belt's Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the black belt may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.
Master's Strike		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, a black belt's unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the black belt's actual alignment, such as a good black belt choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
Exploit Weakness		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, as a swift action, a black belt can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her black belt level against a DC of 10 + the object's hardness or the target's CR. If it succeeds, the black belt gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore the creature or object's DR or hardness.
A black belt can instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws, as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her black belt level until the start of her next turn.
Focus		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 6th level, a black belt can clear her mind of all distractions to gain focus on the battle in front of her. Any time a black belt uses the Total Defense action in combat and is able to perceive at least one foe, she also gains the Focus status.
This grants her a +5 insight bonus to her next attack roll. In addition to this bonus, the black belt's next melee attack also deals double damage. This insight bonus stacks with itself and each application of Focus increases the damage multiplier by 1 (thus a black belt that uses focus two times before attacking will have a +10 insight bonus to her next attack roll and deal three times normal damage if it is a melee attack). This damage bonus is additive with all other damage multipliers as normal, such as from critical hits.
Focus cannot stack with itself more than three times. The status remains until the black belt makes her next attack roll or combat ends. The Focus state is always expended on the black belt's next attack, even if it misses or is interrupted.
Opportunist		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 11th level, once per round, the black belt can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as an attack of opportunity for that round. She cannot use this ability more than once per round, even if she has the Combat Reflexes feat or a similar ability. At 19th level, she can use this ability twice per round.
Awesome Blow		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 14th level, the black belt can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the black belt hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the black belt's choice, and it falls prone. The black belt can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the black belt than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the Awesome Blow monster feat, the black belt can be of any size to use this ability.)
# 218 of 907
Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 19th level, studying the anatomy and spiritual flow of living creatures to so much of an extent allows a black belt to kill opponents with a single, deadly blow, also known as the fabled dim mak. Once per day, as a full-round action, a black belt may use the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique.
The black belt makes a touch attack against her victim, and if successful, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the black belt's level + the black belt's Strength or Dexterity modifier). If a black belt is in the Focus state, the DC to save against this effect increases by 2. If the victim fails this save, its heart will explode once the victim willingly moves at least 25 feet, killing it instantly. This technique is considered a death effect and protection against such will negate it. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, creatures without hearts, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Forced movement does not trigger this and the movement does not have to be all at once or in the same direction, but instead is a cumulative total since the creature became afflicted.
A creature suffering from this technique that has not yet died is in a state of extreme physical duress. This results in being exhausted as well as receiving one point of Constitution damage at the start of each turn (if a creature's Constitution score reaches zero its heart is considered to have exploded).
A black belt can remove another black belt's Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique by expending her daily ability to reverse it as a standard action. A restored creature recovers any Constitution damage suffered because of the technique at a rate of one point per hour. There is no other known cure aside from magical protection against death effects, and there is no other way to remove this status once it is obtained. A black belt is incapable of using this technique on herself, either for harm or to reverse another black belt's attempt.
Anyone that sees the black belt perform this ability may use a Knowledge (History) check (DC 20) to recollect this mythical ability or a Heal check (DC 25) to spot and recognize the consequences of it.

If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the black belt can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.

###Block - Dancer Class Feature

Limit Break		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the dancer receives the Limit Breaks (Perfect Dance and Trance).
Perfect Dance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the dancer to perfect her dancing moves on the battlefield. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four dancer levels, the dancer gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, +2 competence bonus to Attack rolls and skill checks. These bonuses improves by +2 for every four dancer levels attained.
Trance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the dancer to perform any battle dance or mystic dance she knows without using any cost (bardic performance or ki points) for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four dancer levels. This limit break requires only a swift action.
AC Bonus		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When unarmored and unencumbered, the dancer adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her AC. She uses the captivating and confusing movements of the battle dance to evade her foes' attacks. In addition, a dancer gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five dancer levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). This bonus reflects the dancer's intense training in unarmed and unarmored combat. These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the dancer is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, a dancer gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A dancer may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a dancer may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A dancer applies her full Strength modifier (not half) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.
Usually, a dancer's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.
A dancer's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

# 221 of 907
Starting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires the dancer to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move action. Like a bard, a dancer's performance ends immediately if she is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round. A dancer cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a dancer can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action.
This ability otherwise functions as bardic performance; feats and other effects that affect bardic performance (such as the Extra Performance feat) apply to it.

DESC:While performing a battle dance, a dancer gains a +10 enhancement bonus to her land speed.

If exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if the dancer is wearing no armor.
Versatile Dance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level, a dancer gains a bonus equal to half her level on Perform (dance) checks. She can use her bonus for her Perform (dance) skill in place of her bonus for Acrobatics.
Beguiling Dance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, a dancer can perform a battle dance to distract her enemies. Whenever the dancer starts or maintains a beguiling dance, all enemies within 30 feet who can see her must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + half of the dancer's level + her Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. Creatures that fail this save also have their attitude improved by one step for as long as she maintains the dance. This attitude adjustment does not prevent any subsequent attitude changes. For example, an enemy that becomes indifferent toward the dancer as a result of this effect still turns hostile if she then attacks it. A creature can't be affected again by your beguiling dance effect for 24 hours whether or not it succeeds on the saving throw.
Uncanny Dodge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, a dancer cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A dancer with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.
Ki Pool		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 4th level, a dancer gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the dancer's ki pool is equal to 1/2 her dancer level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).
By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a dancer can increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a dancer can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Perform checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A dancer can gain additional powers that consume points from her ki pool by selecting mystic dance moves.
The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the dancer possesses levels in another class that grants points to a ki pool, dancer levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of ki points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is

The scholar must make a ranged touch attack that has a range of 25 feet + 5 feet per two scholar levels.
Sprite Familiar		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, a scholar forms a close bond with a sprite familiar, a creature that helps to guide her along her path. Sprite familiars also aid a scholar by casting healing, defensive, and enhancement based spells depending if the scholar has activated Light Arts or Dark Arts.
Familiar Basics
Use the basic statistics for a sprite (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/sprite), but with the following changes.
Hit Dice: For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.
Hit Points: The familiar has half the master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.
Attacks: Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all her classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to calculate the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.
Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +0, Reflex +2, Will +2) or the master's (as calculated from all her classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.
Skills: For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for a sprite or the master's skill ranks, whichever is better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use. Familiars treat Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Perception, Stealth, and Swim as class skills.

Arcane Reservoir		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Beginning of 2nd level, a scholar has an innate pool of magical energy that she can draw upon to fuel her scholar exploits and enhance her spells. The scholar's arcane reservoir can hold a maximum amount of magical energy equal to her Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier + the scholar's level. Each day, after resting 8 hours, the scholar's arcane reservoir fills with raw magical energy, gaining a number of points equal to her Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier + 1/2 her scholar level. Any points she had from the previous day are lost. She can also regain these points through the consume MP class feature and some scholar exploits. The arcane reservoir can never hold more points than the maximum amount noted above; points gained in excess of this total are lost.
Points from the scholar reservoir are used to fuel many of the scholar's powers. In addition, the scholar can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a free action whenever she casts a spell. If she does, she can choose to increase the caster level by 1 or increase the spell's DC by 1. She can expend no more than 1 point from her reservoir on a given spell in this way.
Scholar Exploits: By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the scholar learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the scholar learns
# 232 of 907
a new scholar exploit selected from the following list. A scholar exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once a scholar exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most scholar exploits require the scholar to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for a scholar exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the scholar's level + the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier.
Acid Jet		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can unleash a jet of acid by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of acid damage + the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). The target is also sickened for 1d4 rounds. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the sickened condition.
Arcane Barrier		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a swift action, the scholar can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a barrier of magic that protects her from harm. This barrier grants the scholar a number of temporary hit points equal to her scholar level + her Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier, and lasts for 1 minute per scholar level or until all the temporary hit points have been lost. Each additional time per day the scholar uses this ability, the number of arcane reservoir points she must spend to activate it increases by 1 (so the second time it is used, the scholar must expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir, 3 points for the third time, and so on). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses do cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.
Arcane Grimoire		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As a standard action, the scholar can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to enhance her grimoire. At 5th level, the grimoire gains a +1 enhancement bonus, which increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). These bonuses can be added to the grimoire, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5. A scholar can also use this exploit to add one of the following weapon special abilities: dancing, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, shock, shocking burst, speed, and spell storing. Adding these special abilities replaces an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the ability's cost. Duplicate special abilities do not stack. If the grimoire is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added to it before any other weapon special abilities can be added. The benefits are decided upon when the exploit is used, and they cannot be changed unless the exploit is used again. These benefits only apply to the grimoire wielded by the scholar; if another creature attempts to wield the grimoire, it loses these benefits, though they resume if the scholar regains possession of the grimoire. The scholar cannot have more than one use of this ability active at a time. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier (minimum 1).
Consume Magic Items		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can consume the power of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands, using them to fill her arcane reservoir. Using this ability is a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity. When using this exploit, the scholar adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell contained in the item (0-level and 1st-level spells do not recharge the scholar's arcane reservoir). If used on a potion or scroll, the item is destroyed. If used on a wand, the wand loses 5 charges; if it has fewer than 5 charges, the wand is destroyed and the scholar gains no benefit. If used on a staff, it loses 1 charge and the scholar gains a number of points to his arcane reservoir equal to the level of the highest-level spell the staff can cast using only 1 charge; if the staff has no spells that require only 1 charge, the scholar cannot consume that staff 's magic. No more than 1 charge can be drawn from a staff each day in this way. Points gained in excess of the scholar's reservoir's maximum are lost. This exploit has no effect on magic armor, weapons, rings, rods, wondrous items, or other magic items besides those noted above.
Counterspell		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the scholar can attempt to counter a spell as it is being cast. She must identify the spell being cast as normal. If she successfully does so, the scholar can
# 233 of 907
attempt to counter the spell as an immediate action and by expending MP equal to at least one higher than the level of the spell being cast. To counterspell, the scholar must attempt a dispel check as if using dispel. If she expends 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of 1, she gains a +5 bonus on the dispel check. Counterspelling in this way does not trigger any feats or other abilities that normally occur when a spellcaster successfully counters a spell.
Dimensional Slide		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a dimensional crack that she can step through to reach another location. This ability is used as part of a move action or withdraw action, allowing her to move up to 10 feet per scholar level to any location she can see. This counts as 5 feet of movement. She can only use this ability once per round. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way, but any other movement she attempts as part of her move action provokes as normal.
Elemental Shield		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can protect herself from elemental damage as a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir.

Face Thief		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to assume an illusory disguise as disguise self.

Flame Arc		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can unleash an arc of flame by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This creates a 30-foot line of flame that deals 1d6 points of fire damage + the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level) to each target in the line. Creatures in the area of effect may attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage.
Ice Missiles		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can unleash a freezing projectile by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet.

In addition, the target is staggered for 1 round. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the staggered condition.
Illusion Catcher		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against illusions. If the scholar successfully disbelieves an illusion, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to try to negate or steal control of the illusion. The scholar attempts a caster level check as if she were dispelling the effect with dispel. If she succeeds, she can either end the effect or alter it as if she were the spell's caster. If the spell's duration is concentration, the scholar must concentrate on the new effect or it ends. The scholar must have the face thief exploit to select this exploit.
Item Crafting: The scholar can select one item creation feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat.
Lightning Lance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.

See Magic		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can see magical auras. If she expends 1 point from her arcane reservoir, for 1 minute she instantly recognizes magic item auras and spell effects (as detect magic). During this time, she is treated as if she had studied each aura for 3 rounds and she treats her Knowledge (arcana) skill check as if she had rolled a 15 on the d20. In addition, if she touches a magic item during this time, she can immediately identify its properties using Spellcraft without needing to spend 3 rounds examining the object. If an enemy possesses the object, the scholar must first succeed at a melee touch attack to identify the item.
Shadow Veil		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, a scholar can pull a veil of shadows around her, making her more difficult to spot and strike.

Dancing Electricity		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the scholar uses the lightning lance exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, all creatures adjacent to the target take an amount of damage equal to half the amount of lightning damage rolled. Adjacent creatures can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve this damage. Whether or not the target makes its saving throw has no effect on adjacent targets. The scholar must have the lightning lance exploit to select this exploit.
Elemental Absorption		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the scholar is using the elemental shield exploit, and the shield prevents 10 or more points of damage, she can absorb a portion of that elemental energy and use it to fuel her exploits. After absorbing the damage, she can use any exploit that deals the same type of elemental damage as the type her shield absorbed, reducing the cost to her arcane reservoir by 1 point. She must use this elemental energy within 1 minute or it is lost. The scholar does not gain more than one such use of elemental energy per round, and she cannot store more than one use of this elemental energy at a time. The scholar must have the elemental shield exploit to select this exploit.
Fast Healing		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A scholar can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and expend MP (maximum of 6) to grant her allies the fast healing ability. Allies within 30 feet gain fast healing equal to the MP spent. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier (minimum 1).
Greater Counterspell		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the scholar uses the counterspell exploit, she can expend MP equal to the same level or greater than the spell to be countered (instead of the spell level +1). The scholar must have the counterspell exploit to select this exploit.
Greater Metamagic Knowledge: The scholar can select a metamagic feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites of this feat. Each morning, when she prepares her spells, the scholar can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to exchange this bonus feat for another metamagic feat, as long as she meets the prerequisites of the new feat. The scholar must have the metamagic knowledge exploit to select this exploit.
Greater Spell Resistance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.

# 237 of 907
Icy Tomb		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the scholar uses the ice missile exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target is coated in rime if it fails its saving throw. As long as the ice remains (typically 1 minute per level in a warm area), the target is entangled (although not anchored) and takes 1 point of Dexterity damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can break free from the ice as a standard action by making a Strength check with a DC equal to 10 + the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier. If the target takes more than 10 points of fire damage from a single attack, the ice melts and the effect ends. The scholar must have the ice missile scholar exploit to select this exploit.
Lingering Acid		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the scholar uses the acid jet exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target takes additional damage on the following rounds if it fails its saving throw. The target takes 1d6 points of acid damage on the following round for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt by the initial attack. On subsequent rounds, the target continues to take 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt on the previous round. The damage continues until the amount of acid damage dealt on the previous round by this effect is 1d6. For example, a 9th level scholar would deal 5d6 points of acid damage + the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier, 2d6 points of acid damage on the following round, and 1d6 points of acid damage on the third and final round. The scholar must have the acid jet exploit to select this exploit.
Redirect Spell		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can gain control of a spell cast by another spellcaster. As a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the scholar can make a caster level check opposed by the creature controlling the spell. If the scholar is successful, she can direct the spell as a free action for 1 round, making any decisions allowed by the spell. This only functions on spells that can be directed or changed once they have been cast, such as flaming sphere or elemental weapon. The spell returns to its owner's control at the start of the scholar's next turn, unless the scholar expends another point from her arcane reservoir at the start of her turn to extend the duration of control by another round. She can continue to control the spell for as long as the spell lasts, provided she keeps spending points from her arcane reservoir.
Resistance Drain		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the scholar is using the spell resistance exploit, she can end the effect as an immediate action whenever her spell resistance successfully protects her from a spell cast by a foe. If she does so, she adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell. These points are temporary and are lost after 1 minute unless used. Points gained in excess of her arcane reservoir's maximum are lost. The scholar must have the greater spell resistance exploit to select this exploit.
Siphon Spell		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When the scholar uses the greater spell disruption exploit, she can siphon some of the power of the targeted spell to restore her arcane reservoir. If the caster level of the spell is equal to or higher than that of the scholar, and she exceeds the DC of the dispel check by 5 or more, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir. If she exceeds this check by 10 or more, she instead adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir. This has no effect on magic items. The scholar must have the greater spell disruption exploit to select this exploit.
Spell Thief		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can steal a spell affecting one creature by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. If the creature is unwilling, she must succeed at a melee touch attack to steal the spell; the target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The scholar can specify a spell affecting the target to steal, but if she's incorrect or doesn't know what spells are affecting the target, the spell stolen is determined randomly from all those affecting the target. If successful, the spell effect transfers to the scholar, affecting her for the remaining duration. Unless the effect normally allows for a new saving throw during its duration (such as at the end of each round), this ability doesn't grant the scholar a saving throw against it. The scholar cannot use this ability to steal a spell with a range of personal or a duration of permanent. The scholar must have the spell tinkerer exploit to select this exploit.
# 238 of 907
Suffering Knowledge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The scholar can learn to cast a spell by suffering from its effects. When the scholar fails a saving throw against a spell cast by an enemy, as an immediate action she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to temporarily acquire the spell. She can cast the spell as if it was a spell she had acquired. The spell must be on the black mage/white mage spell list and must be of a level that she can cast. The ability to cast this spell remains for a number of rounds equal to the scholar's Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is higher) modifier (minimum 1).
Improved Surge		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 13th level, a scholar can use her eldritch surge ability to reroll an attack roll associated with a spell or scholar exploit, or to reroll all of the damage dice associated with a spell or scholar exploit. In the case of attack rolls, this ability must be used after the die is rolled but before the results are revealed. The scholar must take the results of the reroll, even if they are lower.

The scholar must declare the use of this ability before the result of that creature's saving throw is revealed. If the spell or scholar exploit affects more than one target, only one target is affected by this ability.
Bottomless Well		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 19th level, a scholar can spend 1 hour studying her grimoire to refuel herself. Doing so allows her to regain MP as if resting for 8 hours and regain points of arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 her scholar level. She can use this ability multiple times per day, however she still only regains MP once per day.
Magical Supremacy		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 20th level, the scholar learns how to convert her arcane reservoir into spells and back again. She can cast any spell she knows by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the level of the spell to be cast instead of expending MP. When she casts a spell in this fashion, she treats her caster level as 2 higher than normal, and the DCs of any saving throws associated with the spell increase by 2. She cannot further expend points from her arcane reservoir to enhance a spell cast in this way nor can metamagic feats be applied.

###Block - Sword Saint Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: A sword saint is proficient with all simple, martial weapons, and knight swords and with all armor (light, medium, and heavy) and shields (excluding tower shields).
Limit Breaks		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the knight receives the Limit Breaks (Master Swordsman and Perfect Parry).
Master Swordsman		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break allows the sword saint to use any swordskill she knows (readied or not) without needing to expend or ready them. It also grants her a +2 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls + an additional +2 per four sword saint levels. This lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four sword saint levels. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Perfect Parry		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This Limit Break makes the sword saint a master of defense. Any melee or range attacks automatically misses unless a natural roll of 20 is rolled, and even then, the critical threat is unconfirmed unless another natural roll of 20 is rolled. This lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four sword saint levels. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Swordplay		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The hallmark ability of sword saints, they pour a bit of their very soul into their weapons, unlocking powerful sword techniques. These abilities, known as swordskills, can only be used while the sword saint is wielding a sword. This sword is a material focus for all swordskills, though it doesn't need to be a sword crafted by the sword saint. A sword saint can use any swordskill she knows at will, provided she is wielding a sword. As long as she is wielding a sword she forged herself, increase the DCs of all her swordskills by 1.
The three forms of swordskills, in order of their relative power, are basic, advance, and master. A sword saint begins with knowledge of one swordskill, which must be of the basic form. As a sword saint gains levels, she learns new swordskills. At 7th level, a sword saint can learn advance forms, and at 14th level, she can learn master forms.
A sword saint's swordskills are supernatural abilities; using a swordskill is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If a target makes a successful Reflex saving throw against a swordskill they take only half damage from the swordskill, and all other effects of the swordskill are negated. The save DC for a basic form is 10 + 1/2 the sword saint's class level + the sword saint's Charisma modifier, the save DC for an advance form is 12 + 1/2 the sword saint's class level + the sword saint's Charisma modifier, and the save DC for a master form is 14 + 1/2 the sword saint's class level + the sword saint's Charisma modifier.
A sword saint can ready her starting swordskill, but as she advances in level and learns more swordskills, she must choose which swordskills to ready. She readies her swordskills by going over battle tactics, through weapon drills, or spending time meditating in prayer for 10 minutes. The swordskills she chooses remain readied until she decides to repeat this again and change them. Any given swordskill may only be readied once. Sword saints do not need to sleep or be well rested to ready their swordskills; any time they spend 10 minutes in practice or meditation, they can change their readied swordskills. She begins an encounter with all readied swordskills unexpended, regardless of how many times she may have already used them since she chose them. When the sword saint initiates a swordskill, she expends it for the current encounter, so each of her readied swordskill can be used once per encounter (until they are recovered, see below).
For a sword saint to recover expended swordskills, she must take stock of her situation to plan for her next movement. By focusing entirely on a defensive position to prepare her next move, she is able to regain swordskills expended to assist her to victory. By taking a full round action to plan her next move (activating her
# 241 of 907
defensive focus class feature, see below), she recovers a number of expended swordskills equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum of 2). Alternately, she may take a brief pause in battle and recover a single swordskill of her choosing by spending a standard action on her turn.
Auras		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Sword saints begin play with knowledge of one aura that provides benefits to her allies equal to her Charisma modifier. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the sword saint selects an additional new aura. All the auras she knows are available to her at all times, and she can change the aura she is currently using as a swift action. All auras extend out to a 15-ft.-radius and can be activated with a swift action. A sword saint can only have 1 aura activated at a time.

Aura of Concentration		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This aura grants the sword saint and nearby allies to gain a competence bonus on all Concentration checks.

Aura of Disruption		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This aura causes enemies to take a penalty on all Concentration checks. A caster must still make a Concentration check to cast defensively even if the caster is not within threatened reach or the spell is lost and the MP is spent.
Aura of Elemental Resistance		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This aura grants the sword saint and nearby allies to gain an elemental (all) resistance.

Aura of Sanctity		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:This aura grants the sword saint and nearby allies to gain a bonus on all healing and holy spells.

Defensive Focus		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the defensive prowess of the sword saint is second to none, allowing her to focus her actions purely on defending herself and her allies in ways that cannot be replicated. The sword saint gains the Combat Reflexes feat as a bonus feat, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Dexterity modifier to determine the number of additional attacks of opportunity she may make each round.
When recovering swordskills as a full round action, the sword saint sets up a defensive perimeter around himself to defend her allies, increasing her threatened area by 5 ft. for every 5 sword saint levels she possesses. Until the beginning of her next turn, she may make attacks of opportunity against any opponent in this threatened area that provokes attacks of opportunity. She may move as part of these attacks of opportunity, provided her total movement before her next turn does not exceed her speed (her movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal). Additionally, while using defensive focus, the sword saint adds her Charisma modifier plus her class level to her CMD for the purposes of defending against enemies trying to use the Acrobatics skill to prevent her from getting attacks of opportunity against them.
At 10th level, her defensive focus improves further, causing the ground within her melee reach to be treated as if it were difficult terrain, hampering her foes' movement around him. If a foe tries to move through a space within her reach, the movement through those squares costs double (x2). Additionally, while using her defensive focus to make an attack of opportunity, her movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Tactical Presence		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level, the sword saint's innate charisma allows her very presence to aid and assist not only himself but her allies as well, just by her being around. Adopting a presence is a move-equivalent action, and only one presence may be maintained at any given time. At 7th level, the sword saint is capable of adopting a presence as a swift action.
	DESC:&nl;Indomitable Presence: At 2nd level, the sword saint shines as a beacon to her allies on the field of battle, inspiring them to fight with her to their last breath. All allies within 30-ft. of her position gain the benefits of the Die Hard feat, and may add the sword saint's Charisma modifier to Fortitude saves versus death effects, fatigue or exhaustion effects, or poison effects as a morale bonus.
	DESC:&nl;Rallying Presence: The sight of a sword saint on the battlefield is enough to strengthen the hearts and wills of those who fight beside her in battle. At 5th level, the sword saint may add her Charisma modifier as a morale bonus to Will saves versus fear, death effect, or compulsion effects to all allies within 30-ft. of her position. If the sword saint maintaining this presence becomes cowed, frightened, panicked or falls prey to a hostile mind-affecting ability (such as one that would stun or daze her), compulsion or death effect, this presence immediately ends.
	DESC:&nl;Victorious Presence: The preternatural skill at arms that a sword saint of at this level possesses is enough to win any battle. At 9th level, any foe that the sword saint brings to 0 or fewer hit points in battle immediately fuels her hunger for the win, granting her and her allies within 30-ft. of her position the character's class level plus Charisma modifier in temporary hit points. These hit points endure until they are lost or until the end of the encounter, whichever occurs first. Damage inflicted on the sword saint is deducted from her temporary hit points first before being deducted from her normal hit point total.
Warleader		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The sword saint excels in the theater of war because she knows how best to work with her allies. At 3rd level, the sword saint becomes an ever more capable commander and may share tactics with her allies. First, the sword saint gains a teamwork feat as a bonus feat (she must meet the prerequisites for this feat to select it). As a standard action that the sword saint performs, the sword saint and allies within 30- ft. of her can share teamwork feats that they possess with each other, acting as if they both possessed the teamwork feat that they are sharing. The sword saint can only share one teamwork feat at a time, either one of her own (with all allies within 30-ft. of her) or an ally's (in which case only the sword saint receives the ability to use the teamwork feat she does not possess). The sword saint and allies retain the use of this feat for 3 + the sword saint's Charisma modifier in rounds. The character may use this ability 1 + Charisma modifier times per day at 3rd level (minimum of 1), and one additional time per day for every four sword saint levels the character possesses.
Force of Personality		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, the sword saint's forceful personality and bold, headstrong nature assist her in resisting the influence of others. Where others use personal serenity, awareness of the world around them, or plain old sensibility, the sword saint gets by with endless nerve. The sword saint may add her Charisma modifier in addition to her Wisdom modifier to determine her Will save bonus. If the character is ever able to add her Charisma modifier to her Will save through use of another ability (for example, the holy knight's divine grace) she may only add her Charisma modifier once to her Will save.
Tactical Flanker		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Stalwart		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 12th level, a sword saint can use mental and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks.

Steel Defense		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 16th level, the sword saint is capable of turning an otherwise lethal blow and continue the fight. When an attack that inflicts hit point damage from a natural attack, melee weapon, or ranged weapon would reduce the sword saint to 0 or fewer hit points, she can make a Fortitude save (DC the attacker's attack roll) to deflect the attack to her armor or shield (light, heavy, or tower shields only), causing it to suffer the damage in her place (apply item hardness as normal). If this would break the character's armor, it gains the broken condition until it is repaired. The sword saint cannot use this ability with broken armor or a broken shield. The sword saint must be wearing armor or a shield to use this ability.
Master Warleader		KEY:xxx ~ 				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.
