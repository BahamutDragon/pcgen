Ranger
For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game-even fugitives among their own people.
The ranger is an archetype of the archer class.
Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature subtype from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.
# 249 of 907
At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.
If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from-those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.
This ability replaces aim.

Track (Ex): A ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.
This ability replaces hawkeye.
Wild Empathy (Ex): A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
# 251 of 907
The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.
This ability replaces deadshot.
Favored Terrain (Ex): At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from Table: Ranger Favored Terrains. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).
At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.
If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.
This ability replaces evasion and improved evasion.

Hunter's Bond (Ex): At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.
The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: ape, bear (black), hawk, snake (medium), or wolf. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.
This ability functions like the beastmaster animal companion ability, except that the archer's effective beastmaster level is equal to his archer level -3 and does not gain Shared Bestial Rage.
# 252 of 907
This ability replaces all hunter tricks.
Spells: Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of geomancer spells, which are drawn from the geomancer spell list. Like most spellcasters, a ranger can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to her repertoire.
To learn or cast a spell, the ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, Wis 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. In addition, a ranger gains additional MP for having a high attribute (Wisdom). Level MP Spell Level

Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his archer level - 3.
This ability replaces expert archer.
Woodland Stride (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.
This ability replaces improved deadshot
Swift Tracker (Ex): Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.
This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
# 253 of 907
Quarry (Ex): At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.
This ability replaces ranged cleave.
Camouflage (Ex): A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.
This ability replaces fast movement.
Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Stealth skill even while being observed.
This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.
Improved Quarry (Ex): At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.
This ability replaces ranged defense.
Master Hunter (Ex): A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using Survival to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Fortitude save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's Wisdom modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.
This ability replaces master archer.
Sniper
Some say that the sniper is the worst kind of assassin: a killer who waits silently in the shadows and then strikes from a distance without remorse. Snipers, of course, understand that such protestations about “cowardice” and “honor” regarding their profession are in fact merely the bleatings of sheep fearing the slaughter and pay them no heed. Most snipers take pride in their formidable abilities, which allow them to take life quickly, quietly, and efficiently, then disappear into their surroundings without a trace.
The sniper is an archetype of the archer class.
Accuracy (Ex): At 3rd level, a sniper halves all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow or crossbow.
# 254 of 907
This ability replaces the Evasion ability.
Deadly Range (Ex): At 5th level, a sniper increases the range at which she can apply her precision shot damage by 5 feet. This range increases by 5 feet for every 2 levels after 5th.
This ability replaces the Hunter Tricks abilities.
Quick Sniper (Ex): At 11th level, a sniper gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his archer level on Stealth checks when sniping. When he is hit with a ranged attack, he can shoot his bow or crossbow at his attacker as an immediate action if it is loaded.
This ability replaces the Improved Evasion ability.
BARD ARCHETYPES
Dragon Herald
Dragon heralds are messengers and evangelists of true dragonkind. They carry the word of their dragon patrons far and wide, whether that's a message of peace or a declaration of war.
The dragon herald is an archetype of the bard class available only to gria bards.
Dragon Patron (Ex): A dragon herald must choose a particular true dragon species whose glory to extol. In most cases, this is a dragon with whom the herald is familiar, but it could be a dragon deity, a long-dead dragon hero, or even an entire dragon lineage. The energy type associated with her dragon patron determines the energy type used by several of her abilities. She must also designate a sacred space relevant to her dragon choice-usually the lair of a patron dragon or a shrine or holy place associated with a dragon type.
Coat of Arms (Ex): A dragon herald gains energy resistance equal to her dragon herald level against the energy type associated with her dragon patron. This resistance does not stack with any magical or temporary resistances.
Dragon Voice (Ex): A dragon herald gains a bonus equal to half her level on Intimidate and Diplomacy checks. She gains Draconic as a bonus language.
This ability replaces well-versed.
Bardic Performance: A dragon herald gains the following types of bardic performance
Diplomatic Immunity (Su): A dragon herald can use bardic performance to generate a sanctuary effect upon herself. Most use this to deliver the word of their patron or to safely complete Diplomacy or Intimidate checks in the presence of hostile foes. The effect persists for as long as the dragon herald performs and for 1 round after.
This performance replaces countersong and fascinate.
Diplomatic Protection (Su): At 3rd level, the dragon herald can use bardic performance to wrap a single ally in the colors and scales of her patron. The dragon herald must be able to see her ally, and that ally must be able to
# 255 of 907
perceive her performance. While the herald performs, the target gains resistance equal to twice the dragon herald's level to the energy type associated with the dragon herald's patron, and an enhancement bonus to natural armor equal to 1/2 the dragon herald's level.
This performance replaces inspire competence.
Rebuke Foes (Su): At 12th level, the dragon herald gains the ability to rain down her patron's wrath on her enemies, dealing energy damage of the appropriate type equal to twice her dragon herald level (Reflex save for half). She can target one enemy within 50 feet for every 4 dragon herald levels she has. This effect occurs once per round for as long as she continues her performance.
This performance replaces soothing performance.
Retreat to Lair (Sp): At 15th level, the dragon herald can spend 5 daily uses of performance as a full-round action to teleport herself, or a willing target touched, to her sacred place.
This performance replaces inspire heroics.
Master of Persuasion (Ex): At 5th level, the dragon herald becomes so sure in her craft that she can take 10 on any Diplomacy or Intimidate check, even when rushed or threatened. Once per day, she may attempt either a Diplomacy or Intimidate check as a full-round action, instead of spending a full minute. She can use this ability one additional time per day at 11th and 17th level.
This ability replaces all grant move action abilities.
Extol Glory (Su): At 11th level, the dragon herald gains the ability to spread her patron's glory to all intelligent creatures. When she speaks Draconic, any intelligent creature that hears her and knows any language can understand her words. This ability does not allow the dragon herald to understand languages with which she is not familiar.
This ability replaces encore.
Prankster
The prankster sees humor as the highest form or art, and pranks as the highest form of humor. In addition to setting friends up for light-hearted pranks, the prankster can use his quick wit and cruel sense of humor to enrage foes before incapacitating them with a clever turn of phrase.
The prankster is an archetype of the bard class, available only to moogle bards.
Bardic Performance: A prankster's bardic performance functions like a bard's, but some of its performances are exchanged for those listed below.
Mock (Su): At 1st level, the prankster can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become furious with him. Each creature to be mocked must be within 90 feet, able to see, hear, and understand the prankster, and capable of paying attention to him. The prankster must also be able to see the creatures affected. For every three levels the prankster has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.
Each creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the prankster's level + the prankster's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the prankster cannot successfully mock that
# 256 of 907
creature for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature is angered by the performance and seeks to harm the prankster. While the prankster maintains the mocking, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and skill checks until it has successfully attacked the prankster with a melee or ranged attack, or has harmed the creature with a spell that deals damage.
Mock is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. Mock relies on audible and visual components in order to function.
This ability replaces fascinate.
Punchline (Sp): At 3rd level, the prankster can use his performance to tell a punchline to amuse a creature he has already mocked (see above), goading it into hideous laughter. The target collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The target can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the effect ends, it can act normally. On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for the entire duration. Using this ability does not disrupt the mock effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the mock effect). A prankster can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance.
Telling a punchline does not count against a prankster's daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Punchline is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.
This ability replaces inspire courage.
Mass Punchline (Sp): This ability functions just like punchline, but allows a prankster of 18th level or higher to use punchline simultaneously against any number of creatures that he has mocked.
This ability replaces funeral ballad.
Swap (Ex): At 5th level, a prankster can steal an object from a creature and replace it with another object of the same size or smaller that the prankster has in his hand. This functions as the steal combat maneuver, but the prankster does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and may use his Sleight of Hand check in place of his combat maneuver check. If the prankster's check exceeds the target's CMD by 10 or more, the target is unaware the swap has been made until it tries to use the swapped object or the end of its next turn (whichever happens first).
This ability replaces grant move action.
BEASTMASTER ARCHETYPES
Berserker
Berserk rests within the heart of all people, but for some, it's like some barely contained beast ready to tear its way out. For many, this frenzy allows them to face even the most dangerous of foes and survive. Their innate ability to hold on to this energy and ride it through the waves of battle has made them a feared and respected force. Yet some descend even deeper in this berserk state, harnessing it as often as they can, fighting on without care for themselves and showing no mercy to those in their paths. These are the berserkers.
# 257 of 907
The berserker is an archetype of the beastmaster class.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Berserkers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor but no shields.
Limit Break (Su): At 1st level, the berserker receives a Limit Break (The Unstoppable Force).
The Unstoppable Force (Su): This Limit Break imbues the berserker with phenomenal strength and destructive power. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four berserker levels, all bonuses from rage, frenzy, and from any berserk abilities are doubled. After the frenzy ends, all penalties and temporary ability damage are also doubled as well as nonlethal damage. This limit break requires only a swift action.
This replaces the Limit Breaks: Bestial Fury and Mastery of Beasts.
Frenzy (Ex): A berserker can enter a frenzy during combat. While frenzied, he gains a +6 bonus to Strength and, if he makes a full attack action, gains a single extra attack each round at his highest bonus. (This latter effect is not cumulative with haste or other effects that grant additional attacks.) However, he also takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and takes 2 points of nonlethal damage per round. Starting at 1st level, a berserker can frenzy for a number of rounds per day equal to 2 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can frenzy for 2 additional rounds. To end the frenzy before its duration expires, the character may attempt a DC 20 Will save once per round as a free action. Success ends the frenzy immediately; failure means it continues. The effects of frenzy stack with those from any berserk ability the character may have. The character can enter a frenzy as a free action. Even though this takes no time, he can do it only during her turn, not in response to another's action. In addition, if he takes damage from an attack, spell, trap, or any other source, he automatically enters a frenzy at the start of his next action, as long as he still has at least one round of usage of the ability left. To avoid entering a frenzy in response to a provoking effect, the character must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + points of damage taken since his last action) at the start of his next turn. While frenzied, the character cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. During a frenzy, the berserker must attack those he perceives as foes to the best of his ability. Should he run out of enemies before his frenzy expires, his rampage continues. He must then attack the nearest creature (determine randomly if several potential foes are equidistant) and fight that opponent without regard to friendship, innocence, or health (the target's or his own). When a frenzy ends, the berserker is fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity, unable to charge or run) for the duration of the encounter. If the character is still under the effect of a rage ability, the fatigued condition does not apply until the rage ends-at which point the character is exhausted, not merely fatigued.
This replaces the animal companion and wild empathy abilities.
Rage (Ex): A berserker can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a berserker can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that a berserker can rage per day. A berserker can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.
While in rage, a berserker gains a +4 morale bonus to her Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants the
# 258 of 907
berserker 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, a berserker cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.
A berserker can end her rage as a free action and is fatigued after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A berserker cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a berserker falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.
This replaces the bestial rage ability.
Berserk (Ex): Berserkers learn to harness their frenzy to be become unstoppable killing machines. At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, the berserker may choose to learn one of the following special abilities below or a rage power taken from the beastmaster's rage power list.
Burst of Speed (Ex): When charging, the berserker can move an additional +5 feet (1 square) for every level of berserker. For each additional 5 feet a berserker moves while charging, he adds an additional +2 on the damage roll of his first attack if it is successful. Each time a berserker uses burst of speed, he suffers 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. The damage only takes effect once frenzy has ended.
Fury (Ex): Now the embodiment of unfettered frenzy, the berserker can lay to waste anything around. While frenzying, and only while frenzying, the berserker can attack anything close to him. This ability functions the same as the Whirlwind Attack feat, but with the following exceptions. Each time a berserker uses fury, he suffers 1d4 points of Constitution damage. This damage only takes effect once the frenzy has ended.
Rancor (Ex): A berserker is in a constant state of readiness, able to burst into a bloody frenzy at a moment's notice. The rancor ability further extends the power of the normal frenzy ability. A berserker with rancor who frenzies gains one additional attack per round and an additional +2 bonus to Strength. The additional attack is at the berserker's base attack bonus -5. The berserker also suffers an additional -4 penalty to AC on top of that already in place due to the normal use of frenzy. A berserker has no choice in using rancor. If the berserker frenzies, this special ability automatically comes into effect.
Ronso's Grip (Ex): The berserker has learned how to wield larger weapons in a single hand. He can wield two-handed melee weapons as if they were one-handed melee weapons, and wield one-handed melee weapons as if they were light weapons.
Surge (Ex): The berserker's ability to wade headfirst into combat reaches new levels of destruction and mayhem. As a full attack action, the berserker must move in a straight line at his full movement, attacking anything within reach (friend or foe) along that path. During a surge, he must attack up to a number of targets equal to his berserker level. He may not attack a target more than once during a surge. Each time a berserker uses surge, he suffers 1d4 points of Strength damage. This damage only takes effect once the frenzy has ended.
Ferocity (Ex): At 6th level and above, a berserker is such a tenacious combatant that he continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.
This replaces empathic link, nature sense, woodland stride, speak with animals, and trackless step abilities.
Deathless Frenzy (Ex): At 10th level and higher, a berserker can scorn death and unconsciousness while in a frenzy. As long as his frenzy continues, even if reduced to -10 hit points or less, he continues to fight normally
# 259 of 907
until his frenzy ends. At that point, the effects of his wounds apply normally if they have not been healed. This ability does not prevent death from massive damage or from spell effects.
This replaces the beast shape ability.
Greater Frenzy (Ex): Starting at 11th level, when a berserker enters frenzy, the bonus to his Strength increases to +8. The AC penalty decreases to -3.
This replaces the greater bestial rage ability.
Tireless Frenzy: An 18th-level berserker no longer becomes fatigued after a frenzy, though he still takes the nonlethal damage for each round it lasts.
This replaces the tireless bestial rage ability.
Mighty Frenzy (Ex): At 20th level, when a berserker enters frenzy, the bonus to his Strength increases to +10. The AC penalty decreases to -2.
This replaces the animal majesty and mighty bestial rage abilities.
Feral Gnasher
Feral gnashers grow up in the wild, either raised by animals or scraping by on their own, and soon learn to fend for themselves. These beastmasters often utilize pieced-together armor and fight with their sharp teeth and whatever improvised weapons are within reach.
The feral gnasher is an archetype of the beastmaster class, available to ronso beastmasters.
Savage Bite (Ex): At 1st level, a feral gnasher gains a savage bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. At 10th level, the damage from a feral gnasher's bite increases to 1d6 and deals x3 damage on a critical hit.
This ability replaces wild empathy.
Impromptu Armament (Ex): At 2nd level, a feral gnasher gains Throw Anything as a bonus feat and can pick up an unattended object that can be wielded in one hand as a free action. Additionally, the feral gnasher can take Catch Off-Guard in place of a rage power.
This ability replaces the rage power gained at second level.
Lockjaw (Ex): At 3rd level, a feral gnasher gains the grab ability with her bite attack. A feral gnasher can use this ability on a creature up to one size category larger than she is.
This ability replaces woodland stride.
Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex): At 6th level, a feral gnasher gains Improvised Weapon Mastery as a bonus feat.
This ability replaces trackless step.
# 260 of 907
Improved Lockjaw (Ex): At 8th level, as long as a feral gnasher is controlling the grapple with her lockjaw attack, she does not gain the grappled condition, but is unable to move or use her mouth for anything other than grappling.
This ability replaces scent.
Greater Lockjaw (Ex): At 9th level and again at 15th level, the size of a creature a feral gnasher is able to use her lockjaw's grab ability on increases by one size increment.
This ability replaces quarry and improved quarry.
Wicked Improvisation (Ex): At 12th level, a feral gnasher becomes more capable with improvised weapons and natural attacks. The feral gnasher gains a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls when using natural attacks or improvised weapons while raging. At 14th level and every two levels thereafter, the damage bonus increases by +1. This increase is not precision damage and is thus multiplied on a critical hit.
This ability replaces the rage power gained at 12th-level.
Rage Powers: The following rage powers complement the feral gnasher archetype: beast totem, beast totem, greater, beast totem, lesser; terrifying howl, rousted anger.
Marauder
The marauder is a combat specialist whose weapon of choice is any two-handed weapon - a fearsome arm emblematic of Eorzea's pirates. Their approach to battle is one of brute force, relying on strength and steel to crush enemies and sunder weapons. They are highly sought after for their ferocity and intimidating presence, and are often employed to hunt down monsters plaguing the land, or turning the tide of battle between warring nations.
The marauder is an archetype of the beastmaster class.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Berserkers are proficient with all two-handed simple and martial weapons.
Lesser Animal Companion: A marauder's class level is halved (minimum 1) for the purposes of determining his animal companion's abilities, Hit Dice, and so on. The animal companion otherwise functions as normal.
This ability replaces the beastmaster's animal companion.
Shattering Strike (Ex): At 2nd level, a marauder gains a +1 bonus to CMB and CMD on sunder attempts and on damage rolls made against objects. These bonuses increase by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.
This ability replaces feral combat style and wild empathy.
Overhand Chop (Ex): At 3rd level, when a marauder makes a single attack (with the attack action or a charge) with a two-handed weapon, he adds double his Strength bonus on damage rolls.
This ability replaces nature sense and woodland stride.
Weapon Training (Ex): At 5th level, the marauder gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when wielding two-handed melee weapons. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th.
# 261 of 907
This ability replaces natural savagery.
Backswing (Ex): At 7th level, when a marauder makes a full-attack with a two-handed weapon, he adds double his Strength bonus on damage rolls for all attacks after the first.
This ability savage charge.
Piledriver (Ex): At 10th level, as a standard action, a marauder can make a single melee attack with a two-handed weapon. If the attack hits, he may make a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against the target of his attack as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
This ability replaces beast shape.
Greater Power Attack (Ex): At 13th level, when using Power Attack with a two-handed melee weapon, the bonus damage from Power Attack is doubled (+100%%) instead of increased by half (+50%%).
This ability replaces greater savage charge.
Devastating Blow (Ex): At 20th level, as a standard action, a marauder may make a single melee attack with a two-handed weapon at a -5 penalty. If the attack hits, it is treated as a critical threat. Special weapon abilities that activate only on a critical hit do not activate if this critical hit is confirmed.
This ability replaces animal majesty.
Pack-Bonded Hunter
Vargs works best with a pack, and a beastmaster with a hunter's bond with his companions comes closest to duplicating this pack mentality. Some varg beastmasters strengthen this bond with their adventuring comrades, granting the ability to work well as a team when these varg beastmasters direct their activities.
The pack-bonded hunter is an archetype of the beastmaster class, available only to varg beastmasters.
Limit Breaks (Su): At 1st level, the pack-bonded hunter receives the Limit Breaks (Pack Fury and Pack Defense). Pack Fury (Su): This Limit Break causes the pack-bonded hunter and his allies within 30 feet to go into a pack fury. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four beastmaster levels, the pack-bonded hunter and his allies are granted a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution per four beastmaster levels as well as an extra attack at their highest base attack bonus if they make a full attack. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Pack Defense (Su): This Limit Break causes the pack-bonded hunter and his allies within 30 feet to more agile. For the duration of 1 round + 1 round per four beastmaster levels, the pack-bonded hunter and his allies are granted a +2 dodge bonus to AC per four beastmaster levels as well as concealment (20%% miss chance). This limit break requires only a swift action.
These limit breaks replaces the beastmaster's limit breaks (Bestial Fury and Mastery of Beasts).
Pack Foundation (Ex): At 1st level, a pack-bonded hunter receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat for which he must meet the prerequisites. Once per day as a standard action, he may grant this teamwork feat to a single
# 262 of 907
ally within 30 feet who can see and hear him. This ally benefits from the feat for 2 rounds plus 1 round for every three levels the pack-bonded hunter possesses.
This ability replaces the wild empathy class feature.
Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a pack-bonded hunter selects a creature subtype from the pack-bonded hunter favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A pack-bonded hunter may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.
At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the pack-bonded hunter may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.
If the pack-bonded hunter chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from-those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the pack-bonded hunter's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.
This ability replaces feral combat style.

Hunter's Bond (Ex): Also at 1st level, a pack-bonded hunter forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the pack-bonded hunter's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.
This ability replaces animal companion.
Heart of the Pack (Ex): At 6th level, a pack-bonded hunter receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet this feat's prerequisites. Twice per day as a standard action, he may grant one of his bonus teamwork feats to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him; his allies otherwise benefit from this bonus feat per pack foundation. At 12th and 18th level, he gains an additional use of this ability.
This ability replaces speak with animals.
Pack Tactics (Ex): At 10th level, once per day as a move action, a pack-bonded hunter grants half his insight bonus for his quarry ability to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him when he designates his quarry. Additionally, his allies gain a +4 insight bonus to confirm a critical threat. At 19th level, he can use this ability twice per day.
This ability replaces beast shape.
Superior Tactics (Ex): At 20th level, three times per day, after a pack-bonded hunter and his allies roll initiative, the pack-bonded hunter can arrange his and his allies' initiative rolls any way he wishes. Using this ability is not an action.
This ability replaces animal majesty.
Tamer
The tamer befriends - or enslaves - monsters, calling on them to assist him in battle.
The tamer is an archetype of the beastmaster class.
Tools of the Trade (Su): At 1st level, the tamer may choose an implement to wield - a bell or a whip. When the tamer holds the item of his choice while using his Call ability, he gains a specific benefit. Once chosen, this choice is permanent.
? Bell: The tamer may dismiss any creature summoned with a bell as a free action - fast enough to save it even if it would normally be killed.
? Whip: The tamer may order any creature summoned with a whip to take suicidal actions.
This ability replaces feral combat style.
Capture (Su): Also at 1st level, as a standard action, the tamer may make a Wild Empathy check on a creature that has 25%% of its HP remaining, or lower. The DC of this check is equal to the creature's HD. If the check succeeds, the creature is treated as friendly and retreats from the battle for you to call on later. Where the creature goes is unknown, however there doesn't seem to be any dangers there, and the creature can recover
# 265 of 907
from even mortal wounds in less than a day, causing mages to suspect magic to be involved. The creatures are restored to full HP whenever the tamer rests for at least 8 hours. The tamer may capture any number of creatures, however the total HD of the captured creatures can't exceed twice his beastmaster level; any captured creatures whose HD would put him over that limit are immune to his ability until he releases creatures.
This ability replaces bestial rage.
Call (Su): At 2nd level, the tamer may summon creatures he has captured. As a standard action, the tamer summons any number of creatures whose collective HD is no more than 1/2 his tamer level. The creatures will follow your orders to the best of their abilities, however they don't normally follow suicidal orders. The tamer can use this ability once at 2nd level plus an additional time per day at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter. The monsters last the entire combat or until they die. If they survive the battle, they are automatically returned to the tamer's extra-dimensional space, or the tamer can recall them as a swift action at any time.
This ability replaces all of the tamer's rage powers.
Blood Bond (Ex): At 10th level, each of the tamer's captured creatures gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, checks, and saves after witnessing any threat or harm to the tamer. This bonus lasts as long as the threat is immediate and apparent.
This ability replaces beast shape.
Strident Call (Su): Once per day, beginning at 11th level, the tamer may call any number of creatures whose collective HD is no more than his tamer level. This otherwise functions exactly like the tamer's Call ability. The tamer gains extra uses of this ability at 15th and 19th level.
This ability replaces greater bestial rage.
Inspire Greatness (Su): At 18th level, the tamer can grant extra fighting ability to all his captured creatures within 30 feet. An inspired captured creature gains +2 Hit Dice (d10s that grant temporary hit points), a +2 competence bonus on attacks, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. Apply the captured creature's Constitution modifier, if any, to each bonus Hit Die. These extra Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effects of spells such as sleep. The tamer can inspire his captured creatures once per day, and the effects last for 5 rounds. This is a supernatural, mind-affecting, enchantment ability.
This ability replaces tireless rage.
Clarion Call (Su): Once per day, at 20th level, the tamer may call any number of creatures he has captured, limited only by what creatures he has available. This otherwise functions exactly like the tamer's Call ability
This ability replaces mighty bestial rage.
Tree Guardian
Some beastmasters turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest's plants into combat.
The tree guardian is an archetype of the beastmaster class, available to mandragora beastmasters.
Limit Break (Su): At 1st level, the tree guardian receives the Limit Break (Mastery of Plants).
# 266 of 907
Mastery of Plants (Su): This Limit Break functions like the beastmaster's mastery of animals limit break except it only summons plant creatures instead.
This ability modifies and replace the mastery of animals limit break.
Plant Companion (Ex): At 1st level, a tree guardian may begin play with any of the plants listed below. This plant is a loyal companion that accompanies the tree guardian on her adventures. Except for the companion being a creature of the plant type, drawn from the list below, this ability otherwise works like the standard beastmaster's animal companion ability.
This ability modifies and replaces animal companion.

Green Empathy (Ex): At 1st level, a tree guardian can improve the attitude of a plant creature. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The tree guardian rolls 1d20 and adds her beastmaster level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent.
To use green empathy, the tree guardian and the plant creature must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a plant creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A tree guardian can also use this ability to influence an animal, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.
This ability modifies and replaces wild empathy.
Speak with Plants (Su): At 6th level, a tree guardian may comprehend and communicate at will with all plant creatures.
This ability modifies and replaces speak with animals.
Plant Shape (Su): At 10th level, the tree guardian gains the ability to turn herself into the same form as her plant companion at will. A tree guardian loses her ability to speak while in plant form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal plant can make. Changing form (to plant or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.
? Small plant: If the form you take is that of a Small plant, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Constitution and a +2 natural armor bonus.
? Medium plant: If the form you take is that of a Medium plant, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 enhancement bonus to your Constitution, and a +2 natural armor bonus.
? Large plant: If the form you take is that of a Large plant, you gain a +4 size bonus to your Strength, a +2 size bonus to your Constitution, and a +4 natural armor bonus.
This ability modifies and replaces beast shape.
Plant Majesty (Ex): At 20th level, the tree guardian gains this ability that functions the same as the beastmaster's animal majesty but works only on plant creatures.
This ability modifies and replaces animal majesty.
Wild Shadow The isolation that some vieras feel leads them to live a life of isolation amid the wild places of the world. Such beastmasters stalk the wild like shadows, creating close bonds with the wild itself instead of seeking the solace and aid of companions. While ill at ease within cities and other urban areas, they are adept at using the terrain to tactical advantage; they dart through brambles and rough terrain with uncommon grace and use the land itself to lock down enemies.
The wild shadow is an archetype of the beastmaster class, available only to viera beastmasters.
# 268 of 907
Wild at Heart (Ex): At 1st level, a wild shadow adds only 1/2 her class level when making wild empathy checks while in urban areas, and adds only 1/4 her class level to follow or identify tracks in such areas. In non-urban settings, she is considered two levels higher when determining the bonuses for such checks.
This ability alters the track and wild empathy class features.
Favored Terrain (Ex): At 3rd level, a wild shadow may select a type of terrain from Table 3-31: Wild Shadow Favored Terrains. The wild shadow gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when she is in this terrain. A wild shadow traveling through her favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though she may leave a trail if she so chooses).
At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the wild shadow may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.
If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the wild shadow's bonuses do not stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.
This ability replaces alertness and woodland stride.

Woodland Stride (Ex): This ability functions as the 3rd-level beastmaster class feature of the same name, but the wild shadow gains it at 7th level instead.
This ability replaces savage charge.
Unfettered Step (Ex): At 9th level, a wild shadow's woodland stride class feature functions in any difficult terrain within any of her favored terrains, even in areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion.
This ability replaces quarry.
Harrying Attack (Ex): At 10th level, a wild shadow can use her knowledge of terrain to make shrewd attacks in combat. Such attacks can make foes fumble or cause them to become entangled within areas of the wild shadow's favored terrain. As a standard action, the wild shadow denotes one target within line of sight and within one of her favored terrains as her harried prey. Once the foe is so designated, every time the wild shadow
# 269 of 907
hits this harried prey with a melee or ranged weapon attack (either manufactured or natural), that creature is entangled for 1 round. A wild shadow can have no more than one harried prey at a time and that creature must correspond to one of her favored enemy types. She can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but she cannot select a new harried prey for 24 hours. If the wild shadow sees proof that her harried prey is dead, she can select a new harried prey after waiting 1 hour.
This ability replaces beast shape.
Wild Stalker (Ex): At 13th level, a wild shadow learns to better use natural surroundings to obscure her position in combat. Whenever a wild shadow is within one of her favored terrains and a feature of that terrain grants her cover, the bonuses to AC and Reflex saves for that cover improve by 1. Additionally, while she is within one of her favored terrains, if she gains concealment or total concealment, the miss chance of either type of concealment improves by 10%%. Furthermore, at 16th level and 19th level, the bonuses granted by cover increase by 1 and the miss chance increases by another 10%% (maximum +3 and +30%% respectively at 20th level).
This ability replaces greater savage charge
Master of Terrain (Ex): At 15th level, a wild shadow can use her harrying attack against creatures other than her favored enemy or she can spend a standard action to designate up to two of her favored enemies as her harried prey instead.
This ability replaces improved quarry.
BLACK MAGE ARCHETYPES
Arcane Bomber
To many mages, the experimentation of the chemist seems quaint, if not dangerous or frightening. A few mages take up the secrets of the bomb, however, fusing alchemy with their already considerable magical power.
The arcane bomber is an archetype of the black mage class.
Bomb (Su): At 1st level, the arcane bomber gains an ability nearly identical to the chemist's bomb ability. Unlike the chemist, at 1st level, the arcane bomber chooses one type of element from the following list: dark, earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, and wind. He can throw bombs of that type, but cannot modify them with discoveries. This ability stacks with the chemist bomb ability to determine the level of bomb damage, but an arcane bomber that becomes a chemist does not gain that class's bomb ability, nor does a chemist that becomes an arcane bomber gain this bomb ability.
This ability replaces all black magery abilities.
Spellblast Bombs (Su): At 1st level, as a swift action, an arcane bomber can spend MP (to a maximum of half his caster level divided in half, rounded up) to empower the next bomb he throws during his turn. When he does, he gains a bonus to hit with the next bomb he throws before the end of his turn equal to the MP spent, and a bonus to damage equal to twice the MP spent.
This ability replaces cantrips, but the arcana bomber gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.
# 270 of 907
Arcanist
An arcanist is a black mage who has spent a considerable amount of time studying the chaos that is primal magic-she seeks order in chaos, and hopes to master the raw power of primal magic to bolster her own abilities.
The arcanist is an archetype of the black mage class.
Primal Magic (Su): At 1st level, an arcanist may attempt to channel primal magic as a swift action to cast a spell without spending MP. Essentially, an arcanist is forcing primal magic into the world and attempting to shape it into a specific spell effect. To use this ability, she casts the spell as she would normally, but as the spell's effects take place, she makes a concentration check (DC 20 + double the spell's level). If she fails this check, she expends the MP normally as if she had cast it, but its actual effects are replaced by a primal magic event (see rules for primal magic at: http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/variant-magic-rules/primal-magic) with a CR equal to her caster level and she is staggered for 1 round per level of the spell she was attempting to cast. If she makes this check, she casts the spell normally and the MP is not spent. The arcanist may use primal magic in this manner once per day. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, she can use it an additional time per day.
This ability replaces all black magery abilities.
Enhance Primal Magic Event (Su): At 5th level, when an arcanist triggers a primal magic event, as a swift action she can increase or decrease its CR by 1. If she makes a concentration check (DC = 15 + the primal magic event's CR), she can instead increase or decrease the CR by 2. If she reduces a primal magic event's CR to less than 1, the event is negated. She can choose to use this ability after she determines what primal magic event she triggers, but before she resolves the effects of that event.
This ability replaces the black mage bonus feat acquired at 5th level.
Primal Surge (Su): At 10th level, whenever an arcanist triggers a primal magic event, she rolls the percentile dice twice to determine the event that occurs and chooses which one of the two possible events occurs. She becomes resistant to the effects of primal magic events. Anytime an event would affect her, the GM rolls 1d20 + the event's CR against a DC of 11 + her black mage level. If this roll fails, the event does not affect her, similar to a creature with spell resistance ignoring magical effects with an SR check. If the primal magic event is duplicating the effects of a spell that does not allow spell resistance, this resistance does not apply.
This ability replaces the black mage bonus feat acquired at 10th level.
Sorcerer
The sorcerer's family has always been skilled in the eldritch art of magic. While many of his relatives were accomplished black mages, his powers developed without the need for study and practice.
The sorcerer is an archetype of the black mage class.
Bloodline Powers: Magic comes naturally to the sorcerer, but as he gains levels he must take care to prevent the power from overwhelming him.
These abilities replaces all the black magery abilities.
# 271 of 907
Arcane Bond (Su): At 1st level, sorcerers form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a familiar or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the sorcerer's skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a sorcerer can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a sorcerer makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed.
Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for familiars are located here: http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar
Sorcerers who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be held in one hand. If a sorcerer attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.
A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the sorcerer has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, without spending MP. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the sorcerer, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the sorcerer's level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.
A sorcerer can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required Item Creation Feats and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a sorcerer with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the sorcerer who owns it. If a bonded object's owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.
If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the sorcerer rests for 8 hours. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gil per black mage level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A sorcerer can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.
Metamagic Adept (Ex): At 5th level, the sorcerer can apply any one metamagic feat he knows to a spell that he is about to cast without increasing the MP cost. He can use this ability once per day at 5th level and one additional time per day for every four black mage levels he possesses beyond 5th, up to four times per day at 17th level. At 18th level, this ability is replaced by arcane apotheosis.
New Arcana (Ex): At 9th level, the sorcerer can add any one spell from any spell list to his list of spells known. This spell must be of a level that he is capable of casting. He can also add one additional spell at 13th level and 17th level.
Element Power (Ex): At 13th level, the sorcerer picks one element. The DC for any spells he casts from that element increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Elemental Focus.
# 272 of 907
Arcane Apotheosis (Ex): At 18th level, the sorcerer's body surges with arcane power. He can add any metamagic feats that he knows to his spells without increasing the MP cost. Whenever the sorcerer uses magic items that require charges, he can instead expend MP to power the item. For every three MP that he expends, he consumes one less charge when using a magic item that expends charges.
Bloodline Arcana: At 5th level, whenever the sorcerer applies a metamagic feat to a spell that increases MP, increase the spell's DC by +1. This bonus does not stack with itself and does not apply to spells modified by the Heighten Spell feat.
This ability replaces the black mage bonus feat acquired at 5th level.
CHEMIST ARCHETYPES
Apothecary
For various reasons - prejudice, lack of magical talent, or sheer contrariness - the apothecary eschews traditional magical methods of healing. Whenever a patient makes a miraculous recovery without its aid, the apothecary proves his worth, proves that magic is nothing but a convenient shortcut.
The apothecary is an archetype of the chemist class.
Field Medicine (Ex): At 1st level, an apothecary can treat wounds (his own or those of others) by touch. Each day he can use this ability a number of times equal to half his chemist level plus his Wisdom modifier. With one use of this ability, an apothecary can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two chemist levels he possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the apothecary targets himself, in which case it is a swift action. An apothecary needs one hand free hand to use this ability. In place of a discovery, the apothecary can select one blessing from the holy knight's list, using his chemist level to determine which are available. This blessing applies to both Field Medicine and Spontaneous Healing, if the apothecary has both.
This ability replaces bomb.
Mad Doctor: In a land of magic, the apothecary is determined to heal others through science instead. All discoveries and grand discoveries the apothecary takes are considered (Ex) even when they would normally be (Su). This applies to alchemical items the apothecary crafts as well. Any discovery or alchemical item that allows a save takes a -2 penalty to the save DC.
This ability replaces Throw Anything.
Soldier's Draught (Ex): At 6th level, the apothecary can whip up a special concoction to help a soldier ignore his weariness. Drinking this potion grants the drinker temporary hit points equal to the apothecary's chemist level and a +4 bonus to Fortitude saves. It also allows him to temporarily ignore the negative effects of ability drain, ability damage, negative levels and the status effects disease, exhaustion, fatigue, poison and sleep. While suppressed, any duration these effects have are paused and resume after the potion wears off.
The effects of this potion last until the end of battle; if there are any temporary hit points remaining they disappear. In addition to the status effects gained before or during the potion's duration, the imbiber is fatigued until he rests. If the character is already fatigued, he is instead exhausted until he rests. If the character is already exhausted, he must make a Fortitude save each round or take 1 point of non-lethal damage until he rests
# 273 of 907
for 8 hours or falls unconscious. If the character falls unconscious, when he wakes up he remains exhausted. If the character rests for 8 hours, when he wakes up he remains fatigued.
This ability replaces the discovery gained at 6th level.
Grenadier
Grenadiers train to exercise their talents in the thick of battle. They learn methods of combining weapon attacks with their alchemical magic in order to become more adept at using alchemical bombs or using alchemical items in conjunction with their martial skills.
The grenadier is an archetype of the chemist class.
Martial Weapon Proficiency: At 1st level, a grenadier picks one martial weapon to become proficient in the use of.
This ability replaces Craft Alchemical Item.
Precise Bombs (Ex): At 3rd level, a grenadier gains the precise bombs alchemist discovery as a bonus discovery.
This ability replaces Swift Alchemy.
Alchemical Weapon (Su): At 4th level, a grenadier can infuse a weapon or piece of ammunition with a single harmful alchemical liquid or powder, such as alchemist's fire or sneezing powder, as a move action. This action consumes the alchemical item, but transfers its effect to the weapon in question.
The alchemical item takes full effect on the next creature struck by the weapon, but does not splash, spread, or otherwise affect additional targets. Any extra damage added is treated like bonus dice of damage, and is not doubled on a critical hit. The alchemical treatment causes no harm to the weapon treated, and wears off 1 minute after application if no blow is struck. At 11th level, a grenadier can use her alchemical weapon ability as a swift action. At 18th level, this ability becomes a free action.
This ability replaces Alchemical Mixture (Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3).
Directed Blast (Su): At 5th level, a grenadier can detonate a bomb so that it splashes in a 20-foot cone rather than affecting a radius. The cone starts at the alchemist and extends away from her in the direction she chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target of the bomb and makes her attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the cone take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive directed blast, the cone of splash damage is 30 feet long instead of 20 feet.
This ability replaces Anesthetic.
Staggering Blast (Su): At 9th level, a grenadier's bombs become particularly overwhelming when they explode. Whenever a grenadier scores a successful critical hit with a bomb, the creature directly struck by that bomb is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equals the bomb's Reflex save DC to avoid splash damage) reduces the duration to 1 round. The effects of this ability stack with a frost bomb's staggering effect, but not with the effects of the Staggering Critical feat. Additional hits from a staggering blast add to the effect's overall duration.

This ability replaces the Mix ability.
Plague Bringer
The plague bringer sees disease as the ultimate weapon, and has worked tirelessly to master new diseases and disease-delivery systems. A plague bringer feels no more remorse at unleashing his armaments on his enemies than an archer does when firing an arrow in the heat of battle. Disease is a tool, and the plague bringer is its master.
The plague bringer is an archetype of the chemist class, available only to burmecian chemists.
Plague Vial (Su): At 4th level, a plague bringer can create a plague vial, an alchemically grown and concentrated disease sample. It takes 1 hour to prepare a plague vial, and once prepared, the vial remains potent until used. A plague bringer can only maintain 1 plague vial at a time-if he prepares a second vial, any existing plague vial becomes inert. A plague vial that is not in a plague bringer's possession becomes inert until a plague bringer picks it up again.
It's a standard action to drink a plague vial. Upon being imbibed, the plague vial infects the plague bringer's blood, sweat, tears, and other bodily fluids for 10 minutes per chemist level. Any creature that harms him with melee attacks (except with reach weapons) must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the chemist's level + his Intelligence modifier) or become sickened for 1 round per plague bringer level. The plague bringer is immune to the effect of his own plague vial, but not that of another's plague vial. The effects of multiple plague vials do not stack.
As a standard action, the plague bringer can infect a weapon with this sickness (typically by licking it or wiping his blood or pus on it). The disease on the weapon works like a poisoned weapon, except the source is a disease instead of a poison (so a dwarf's resistance to poison does not apply).
Anyone other than a plague bringer (including another chemist) who drinks a plague vial must make a saving throw against the vial's DC or become nauseated for 1 hour.
This ability replaces alchemist mixture gained at 4th, 11th, and 18th.
Discoveries: The following discoveries complement the plague bringer archetype: explosive bomb, precise bombs, smoke bomb; breath weapon bomb, fast bombs, nauseating bomb; plague bomb; greater plague bomb; lingering plague.
CHOCOBO KNIGHT ARCHETYPES
Fell Rider The fell rider rides a bestial steed, a mount mastered by him alone. He tramples his enemies down, leaving twisted bodies in his wake, and fear rides with him.
The fell rider is an archetype of the chocobo knight class, available only to galka chocobo knight.
Brute Steed (Ex): A fell rider's chocobo mount is unusually large and fierce. It gains a +2 bonus to Strength, but takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity.
# 275 of 907
This ability otherwise works like the chocobo knight's chocobo mount ability and alters that ability.
Rampage (Ex): At 3rd level, a fell rider gains Trample as a bonus feat. The fell rider receives a +2 bonus on overrun attempts made while mounted. In addition, his mount gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when making hoof attacks or using the trample monster ability, even when not overrunning.
This ability replaces knight's charge.
Dread Rider (Ex): At 4th level, a fell rider gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his level on Intimidate checks made while mounted. Once per round as a free action, he can make an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe he has trampled or charged while mounted.
This ability replaces expert trainer.
Fell Presence (Ex): At 6th level, a fell rider inspires dread while mounted. As long as the fell rider is mounted, all enemies within 60 feet receive a -2 penalty on savings throws against fear. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this penalty increases by -1.
This ability replaces battlefield agility.
Deadly Rampage (Ex): At 11th level, a mounted fell rider no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when he attempts to overrun a creature. He can make a single melee attack against the creature as a free action if the overrun attempt succeeds.
This ability replaces greater charge.
Terror (Ex): At 15th level, a fell rider can rear up his mount as a standard action, spreading terror among his enemies. Enemies within 60 feet who can see the fell rider must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the fell rider's level + the fell rider's Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1 round per level the fell rider possesses. Creatures with half or fewer Hit Dice than the fell rider become frightened instead. An opponent that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to that fell rider's terror ability for 24 hours.
This ability is a mind-affecting fear effect, and replaces protect the meek.
Unstoppable Rampage (Ex): At 20th level, a mounted fell rider can overrun up to four creatures as part of a single overrun combat maneuver. Each attempt made against a creature after the first receives a cumulative -5 penalty (for example, the fourth overrun attempt would be at a -15 penalty). If any overrun attempt fails, the fell rider cannot make further overrun attempts that round. Attacks made by the fell rider or his mount as part of the overrun, such as those provided by the Trample feat or the deadly rampage ability, receive a +4 bonus to hit, and any critical threats from these attacks automatically confirm.
This ability replaces supreme charge.
Mog Knight Some moogles prefer to be magicians, thieves, and even masters of geomancy or practitioners of the dark arts, but even then there are those that can't fight on their own and rely on a wild companion, a mystical chocobo companion, one that can change colors as they accrue power.
The mog knight is an archetype of the chocobo knight, only available to members of the moogle race.
# 276 of 907
Limit Breaks (Su): At 1st level, a mog knight receives the Limit Break (Deathblow!!)
Deathblow!! (Su): This limit break allows the mog knight and his mount to charge an opponent, and deal an additional 2d6 points of damage + 2d6 per four chocobo knight levels, and inflicts the Disable status effect upon a failed Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 chocobo knight level + strength modifier) for 1 round + 1 round per four chocobo knight levels.
This ability replaces the Supreme Overrun Limit Break.
Charge Combo (Ex): At 1st level, once per day, a mog knight when mounted can make a charge as normal, but may act as if they had the pounce special ability, allowing them to make a full attack when charging, and gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and CMB rolls made to bull rush while using this ability. This ability gains an additional use per day for every three levels above first, as well the circumstance bonus increases by 1 for every fifth level.
This ability replaces the Challenge ability.
Mog Rush (Su): At 10th level, once per day, a mog knight can use his Charge Combo ability, all attacks made through this ability are considered confirmed critical hits, provided that they hit (critical threats cannot automatically hit with this), they miss otherwise, and the critical multiplier is always considered to be (x2). This ability can be used once more per day at 20th level.
This ability replaces the Burst of Speed ability.
Ultima Charge (Su): At 20th level, once per day, a mog knight can use his Mog Rush ability. All attacks made through this ability are considered to hit automatically, and act as critical threats with a damage multiplier of (x3). When this ability is resolved, the mog knight is fatigued for 2d4 rounds.
This ability replaces the Supreme Charge ability.
Order of the Bird Chocobo knights of the Order of the Bird pledge to defend tarutarus, tarutaru settlements, and other innocent folks by patrolling the wilderness and seeking out possible threats to both individuals and whole communities. These chocobo knights hunt down potential danger with a ruthless efficiency and determination that non-tarutarus find surprising and even somewhat alarming.
The order of the bird is an archetype of the chocobo knight class, available only to tarutaru chocobo knights.
Danger Ward (Ex): At 2nd level, the chocobo knight can ready his allies for impending danger. As a standard action, he can ready all allies within 30 feet of the danger ahead, granting a bonus on a single type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex or Will) that he chooses when he grants this boon. At any point in the next minute, when these allies fail a saving throw of that type, they can choose to reroll the saving throw with a +4 competence bonus as an immediate action, but must take the results of the reroll even if it is worse. He can use this ability up to three times per day, once for each type of saving throw.
This ability replaces steadfast mount.
# 277 of 907
Fowl Ferocity (Ex): At 8th level, when the chocobo knight uses his chocobo mount to perform a bull rush or overrun maneuver, the mount is considered to be one size category larger for the purposes of determining the size of creature it is maneuvering against and the mount's CMB. He also receives a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Mounted Combat, Ride-by Attack, Skill Focus (Ride), Spirited Charge, Trample, or Unseat. He must qualify for the feat selected.
This ability replaces relentless steed.
Giant Slayer (Ex): At 15th level, when the chocobo knight hits the target of his challenge with a melee attack, and that target is at least two size categories larger than the chocobo knight, he gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 his chocobo knight level. This damage is multiplied on a critical hit.
This ability replaces protect the meek.
DARK KNIGHT ARCHETYPES
Death Knight
The dark knight uses necromantic magic instead of black magic, preferring the company of the undead over the living. Being one with the undead has its advantages, the dark knight is able to inflict a plague upon others as well as command the undead to obey him.
The death knight is an archetype of the dark knight class.
Infection (Su): Once per day, a death knight can call upon the darkest magic to spawn an evil plague within himself. Creating this plague is a swift action, and while the death knight is a carrier, the disease does not harm him and he shows no symptoms. The death knight can spread the plague; his Harm Touch ability inflicts the zombie status effect on the target, as well as dealing damage. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the death knight infect himself one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.
This ability replaces the Smite Good ability.
Malignance (Su): While the death knight is under the effects of Infection, as a move action, he can attempt to exert his will over a single undead. He gives the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. Intelligent undead (including living creatures with the zombie status) get a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the death knight's class level + the death knight's Charisma modifier) each time you give a command. You may select from the following options.
? Approach: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.
? Attack: The subject attacks a creature you choose, moving if it needs to. If the subject can charge the target, it does so. Moving and charging provoke attacks of opportunity as normal.
? Drop: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.
? Fall: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.
? Flee: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.
# 278 of 907
? Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.
If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, this ability automatically fails.
At 3rd level, intelligent undead (including living creatures with the zombie status) must make a Will save in order to attack you. Mindless undead will not willingly attack the death knight, though they may be commanded to do so by another death knight or necromancer.
At 6th level, the death knight can channel a use of his Nimbus of Darkness through a single undead. This consumes two uses of his Nimbus of Darkness ability, and functions exactly as normal except that it emanates from an undead creature of your choice.
At 9th level, the death knight gains the Special Command.
? Special: The death knight must select a spell, song, limit break, or special ability that the subject possesses. The subject uses the special attack against a creature the death knight chooses. If the subject does not have the special attack, the Command fails.
At 12th level, the death knight can channel a use of his Harm Touch or Dark Sword Tech through a single undead. This consumes two uses of the ability used, and functions exactly as normal except that an undead creature of your choice must make the attack roll.
At 15th level, while the death knight is under the effect of Infection, he and his zombie minions spread the infection through simple contact. When they make an unarmed strike or natural attack, or when an enemy makes an unarmed strike or natural attack against them, the enemy is afflicted with the zombie status effect.
At 18th level, while the death knight is under the effect of Infection, he can command a single living creature with the Zombie status effect to Die.
? Die: The subject gains the Doom status. 2d4 rounds after being commanded to die, the subject dies and rises as an actual zombie under the control of the death knight. The death knight can use a full-round action to Command every actual zombie under his control to take the same action. The death knight can have a total of 20 zombies under his control at the same time, and they remain in his control until he releases them or they are destroyed.
These abilities replace the Defile abilities.
Dead Magic: The death knight draws his spells from the necromancer spell list rather than the dark knight spell list, but is otherwise unchanged.
This ability modifies and replaces the dark knight's spellcasting ability.
Fell Knight
Some dark knights feel the call of black magic more closely than others, focusing on reaching greater heights.
The fell knight is an archetype of the dark knight class.
# 279 of 907

Unholy Steed (Su): Upon reaching 5th level, the fell knight gains the ability to gain the service of a yellow chocobo to serve her in her crusade against good. This mount functions as a chocobo knight's animal companion, using the fell knight's level as her effective chocobo knight level.
Once per day, as a full-round action, a fell knight may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the fell knight's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the fell knight. A fell knight can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.
At 10th level, a fell knight's mount becomes a black chocobo.
At 15th level, a fell knight's mount gains spell resistance equal to the fell knight's level + 11.
Should the fell knight's mount die, the fell knight may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains a fell knight level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the fell knight takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
This ability replaces the Dark Sword Tech abilities.
# 280 of 907
DRAGOON ARCHETYPES
Dragon Knight Where most dragoons developed their skills to counter the awesome powers of the great beasts. But some see them not as beasts, and instead fight with them, side by side. The dragons they fight beside are not pets, or even servants, but their companions, and in return for fighting by their side the dragoon teaches them how to be strong. Not relying on hundreds of years of growth and experience, but the brashness and ingenuity of youth.
The dragon knight is an archetype of the dragoon class, available only to burmecian dragoons.
Dragon Companion (Ex): Beginning of 1st level, a dragon knight gains the friendship of an intelligent young wyrmling to assist him in battle. This dragon functions as a beastmaster's animal companion, using the dragoon's level as his effective beastmaster level. A dragon knight's companion does not gain the shared rage special ability. Wyrmling Starting Statistics Size: Small; Speed: 40 ft., Fly 40 ft. (Good); AC: +4 natural armor; Attack: bite (1d6), claw (1d4); Ability Scores: Str 12, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 6, Cha 12; Special Qualities: Immunity to Sleep and Disable Status effects, Elemental Affinity. At 4th level, the wyrmling advances into a drake. Drake 4th-Level Advancement Size: Small; Speed: 40 ft., Fly 40 ft. (Good); AC: +4 natural armor; Attack: bite (1d6), claw (1d4); Ability Scores: Str 14, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 10, Wis 6, Cha 12; Special Attacks: Breath Weapon (1d6/HD); Special Qualities: Immunity to Sleep and Disable Status effects, Elemental Affinity. At 8th level, the drake advances into a wyvern Wyvern 8th-Level Advancement Size: Medium; Speed: 50 ft., Fly 50 ft. (Average); AC: +6 natural armor; Attack: bite (1d8), claw (1d6); Ability Scores: Str 18, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 10, Wis 6, Cha 12; Special Attacks: Breath Weapon (1d8/HD); Special Qualities: Immunity to Sleep and Disable Status effects, Elemental Affinity, DR 4/-.

(Poor); AC: +8 natural armor; Attack: bite (1d10), claw (1d8); Ability Scores: Str 22, Dex 10, Con 20, Int 12, Wis 8, Cha 14; Special Attacks: Breath Weapon (1d10/HD), Power Dive; Special Qualities: Immunity to Sleep and Disable Status effects, Elemental Affinity, DR 6/-. At 16th level, the dragon advances into a wyrm. Wyrm
# 281 of 907
16th-Level Advancement Size: Large; Speed: 60 ft., Fly 60 ft. (average); AC: +8 natural armor; Attack: bite (1d10), claw (1d8); Ability Scores: Str 24, Dex 10, Con 22, Int 12, Wis 8, Cha 16; Special Attacks: Breath Weapon (1d10/HD); Special Qualities: Immunity to Sleep and Disable Status effects, Elemental Affinity, DR 8/-, Frightful Presence. A dragon knight does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his companion. The companion is always considered combat trained, and begins play with Endurance as a bonus feat. A dragon knight's bond with his companion is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a dragon knight's companion die, the dragon knight may find another dragon to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new companion does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, improved evasion, or blood bond special abilities until the next time the dragon knight gains a level. Dragon Companion Special Attacks Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon companion breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any intersection adjacent to the dragon companion and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice. Creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + ½ dragon companion's HD + dragon's Con modifier. The breath weapon can be either a line or a cone, and the dragon knight can change which whenever his dragon would advance a stage. The line is 5 ft. for every HD the companion has, and the cone is 5 ft. for every 2 HD the companion has (rounded down). Power Dive (Ex): When a dragon companion with this ability charges from at least 50 ft. above the target, the dragon's attack deals double damage. Dragon Companion Special Qualities Elemental Affinity (Su): Each dragon companion has an elemental affinity (Earth, Fire, Ice, Lightning, Water, or Wind), which determines what kind of damage its breath weapon deals, and giving it the ability to absorb one element, resist another, but also increases the damage it takes from yet another. The dragon knight can change his dragon companion's elemental affinity whenever his dragon would advance a stage. Frightful Presence (Ex): A wyrm can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon companion attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 10 feet per 3 HD are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10+ ½ dragon's HD + dragon's Cha modifier) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons. Damage Reduction: Wyverns and stronger dragons have damage reduction. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Immunities (Ex): All dragons have immunity to sleep and disable status effects. This ability replaces deadly lancer, flexible flanker, shellbreaker, and step aside.
Draconic Resistance (Ex): At 2nd level, a dragon knight gets a +2 bonus to Reflex saves against attacks that inflict damage of the same energy type of the dragoon's dragon companion. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd, to a maximum of +5 at 14th level. Every four levels beyond 14th, the dragon knight gains 5 points of resistance to the appropriate energy type (maximum 10 points of resistance).
# 282 of 907
This ability replaces pole fighting.
Detect Dragons (Su): At the beginning of 3rd level, the dragon knight is aware of any dragons within a radius of 1 mile per class level. This ability is always active and informs the paladin only of the presence or absence of dragons. By spending one or more full rounds concentrating on these presences, the dragon knight can gleam additional information about the dragons in the area. By spending one full round concentrating on these presences, the dragon knight can determine the number of dragons in the area. By spending an additional round, he can learn the locations of those creatures. A dragon knight may then spend an additional round of concentration to focus on a single dragon within the area, alerting him to the creature's alignment, color and age category if it is a true dragon.
This ability replaces steadfast pike.
Draconic Prowess (Ex): At 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th levels, a dragon knight rolls 1d12 for his Hit Die instead of 1d10 to determine hit points. The dragon knight also gains other abilities, as explained below:
? At 3rd and 15th levels, the dragon knight gains a +1 increase to natural armor bonus.
? At 7th level, he gains a bonus feat from the following list: Blind-Fight, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, or Toughness.
? At 11th level, the dragon knight's bite attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage of his energy type on a successful hit.
These abilities replaces armor training, tail sweep, mighty charge, and swoop of the dragon.
Dragon Breath (Su): At 5th level, a dragon knight may use a breath weapon once per day as a standard action. When he gains this ability, choose earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind-this determines what kind of damage his breath weapon deals. Once the dragon knight makes this choice, he cannot change it later. The dragon knight's breath weapon fills a 15-foot cone, and deals 3d6 points of damage-this damage increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered level he gains beyond 5th level. A creature hit by the dragon knight's dragon breath attack can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragoon's level + his Strength modifier) to take half damage. At 10th level, the dragon knight can use this ability two times per day, at 15th level, he can use it three times per day, and at 20th level, he can use it four times per day.
This ability replaces all dragoon training.
Dragon Knight (Ex): At 20th level, the dragoon has reached the pinnacle of being a dragon knight. The dragoon chooses a dragon subtype as the same as his dragon companion (earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind) and he gains the half-dragon template.
This ability replaces leaping charge.
Lancer These gallant lancers serve in the vanguard of many armies or as knights-errant. They are born leaders and masters of the mounted charge.
The lancer is an archetype of the dragoon class.
# 283 of 907
Limit Break (Su): At 1st level, the lancer receives a Limit Break (Fight as One).
Fight as One (Su): This Limit Break allows the lancer and his mount to fight as if they were one mind and one body. They both receive a +2 morale bonus on Attack rolls, Saving Throws, and Skill checks + an additional +2 bonus per four lancer levels. The mount can full-attack after a charge. This lasts for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four lancer levels. This limit break requires only a swift action.
This ability replaces the Falling Meteor Limit Break.
Skilled Rider (Ex): At 1st level, a lancer gains both the Mounted Combat and Skill Focus (Ride) feats as bonus feats.
This ability replaces the jump ability.
Mounted Lancer (Ex): At 1st level, the lancer has learned to use his mount to his advantage to inflict more damage. Whenever the lancer charges while on a mount at least twenty feet from his opponent and strikes his foe using a spear, lance, or polearm, the lancer deals an additional +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage is 1d6 when first gained, and it increases by 1d6 with each improvement. If the attack is also a critical hit, the extra damage is not also multiplied. For every 10 feet the lancer charges while on a mount beyond the first 20 feet, the lancer deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.
This ability modifies and replaces deadly lancer.
Lancer's Charge (Ex): At 3rd level, a lancer learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The lancer receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the lancer does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while mounted.
This ability replaces armor training.
Battlefield Agility (Ex): At 4th level, a lancer learns to be more aware of the threats that surround him in combat, and shares this awareness with his loyal steed. Both the lancer and his mount gain Mobility as a bonus feat.
This ability replaces hardy landing.
Spinning Lance (Ex): At 7th level, a lancer may alternate attacks with the piercing head of his lance with reach, or with the butt end (treat as a club) against adjacent targets. Unlike a double weapon, the masterwork quality and magical special abilities apply to both ends of the lance, except for those weapon special abilities that apply only to edged weapons.
This ability replaces tail sweep.
Mounted Expertise (Ex): A lancer of 10th level or higher is highly skilled at fighting while riding his mount. Before making any rolls when using the attack action or the full attack action while mounted on his mount in melee, a lancer may shift points between his attack rolls and his Armor Class. A penalty subtracted from an attack roll applies as a dodge bonus to his AC; a penalty subtracted from Armor Class applies as a bonus on all attack rolls for that round. The points adjusted with the mounted expertise ability may not exceed the lancer's base attack bonus. All changes to attack rolls and AC persist until the lancer's next action.
# 284 of 907
This ability replaces springing charge.
Piercing Lance (Ex): At 11th level, as a standard action or as part of a charge, a lancer attacking a mounted opponent can make two attacks, one against the mount and the other against the rider, using his highest base attack bonus. Furthermore, if the mount is hit and its rider attempts to negate the hit with the Mounted Combat feat, the lancer's attack roll is considered 4 higher when calculating the DC of the Ride check to negate the hit.
This ability replaces mighty charge.
Superior Mounted Combat (Ex): At 13th level, a lancer may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) twice per round to negate a successful hit on his mount. At 19th level, the lancer may make these attempts three times per round.
This ability replaces shellbreaker.
Leaping Lance (Ex): At 15th level, a lancer and his mount suffer no armor check penalty on Acrobatics checks while mounted. When charging, a lancer may jump from his mount toward his target. If he jumps 10 feet, his charge modifiers on attack rolls and to AC are doubled and he is still considered mounted for lance damage, Mounted Combat feats, and so on.
This ability replaces swoop of a dragon.
Supreme Charge (Ex): At 20th level, whenever the lancer makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the lancer confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to dazed for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the lancer's base attack bonus.
This ability replaces leaping charge.

In addition, any creature struck by her Touch of Serenity, even if it saves, must make an additional Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her tranquil guardian level + her Charisma modifier) the next time it tries to attack. If it fails this save, the attack (including spells or special abilities) automatically fails.

ILLUSIONIST ARCHETYPES
Shadowcaster
Shadowcasters are trained in dark mysteries, their training allows them to harness the power of shadows to bolster their spellcasting.
The shadowcaster is an archetype of the illusionist class.
Class Skills: A shadowcaster gains Stealth as a class skill.
Shadow Spells (Su): At 1st level, a shadowcaster uses his shadow to store additional MP. He must spend his entire period of spell preparation in dim illumination to use this ability. He may store MP equal to the level of the highest-level illusionist spell he can cast. For example, if he can cast 6th-level illusionist spells, he could store 6 MP. These MP are stored in his shadow. He can only cast these spells when he is in an area of normal light or dim light. He gains Shadowtongue as a bonus language.
This ability replaces cantrips, but the shadowcaster gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.
Wall of Darkness (Su): At 1st level, a shadowcaster can summon a thin wall of shadow anywhere within 30'. The wall is 1 foot thick and no bigger than 10 feet in any other dimension. This wall lasts for 1 round and obscures vision giving 20%% concealment in both directions. Creatures passing through the wall must make a Will save to avoid becoming disoriented (dazed) for the remainder of their turn. The concealment effect of the
# 298 of 907
wall always works but a creature can only be affected by the disorienting effect once per day. The shadowcaster can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.
This ability replaces blinding ray.
Shadow Mask (Sp): At 3rd level, a shadowcaster can alter the shadows around him to conceal his presence. The shadow mask lasts up to one minute per level, the duration need not be continuous but must be used in one minute increments. Shadow mask gives a +3 enhancement bonus to Stealth checks while it is active. At 9th level the bonus to Stealth increases to +6 and for the duration of the effect the shadowcaster has 20%% concealment. At 15th level the bonus to Stealth increases to +9 and he can summon the shadow mask as a swift action.
This ability replaces all instances of haze.
Stealthy Illusions (Ex): At 4th level, a shadowcaster can make a Stealth check with a penalty of -5 to cast any spell in the illusion school without being detected. If the shadowcaster is using Stealth at the time he remains hidden. If the shadowcaster is in plain sight he is still visible but the spellcasting is not noticed.
This ability replaces social cloaking.
Shadowsight (Ex): At 5th level, a shadowcaster gains darkvision 60 feet. If the shadowcaster already has darkvision 60 feet, then he gains darkvision 120 feet.
This ability replaces the shadowcaster's 5th-level illusionist bonus feat.
Shadow Step (Su): At 9th level, as long as the shadowcaster is in any area of shadowy illumination he can step into and move through the Plane of Shadow as a standard action. Every round spent moving though the Plane of Shadow, the shadowcaster moves up to 50' in the Material Plane. A shadowcaster can spend up to 1 round per level in the Plane of Shadow and the duration does not need to be consecutive. When returning to the Material Plane the shadowcaster appears in a random unoccupied location within a 10' square. This ability is otherwise similar to the shadow walk spell.
This ability replaces extended illusions.
Shadowy Specialization (Ex): At 10th level, when a shadowcaster casts shades, shadow summoning, shadow elemental, and similar illusion spells that have a listed fraction of the strength of real effects, he increases the percentage of damage caused by the spell's effect or summoned creatures by one-fifth (+20%%) against creatures that make their saving throw against the effect, up to a maximum of 100%% of the strength. For example, shadow elemental and shadow summoning deal 40%% normal damage on a successful save instead of 20%%.
This ability replaces the shadowcaster's 10th-level illusionist bonus feat.
Deeper Shadows (Su): At 15th level, any spell cast with the Shadow descriptor that is partially real is 10%% more real than normal. For example, shadow summoning cast by a shadowcaster with this ability is 30%% real. This ability stacks with shadowy specialization.
This ability replaces doublecast.
# 299 of 907
Cloak of Shadow (Su): At 20th level, the barrier between the Plane of Shadow and a shadowcaster blurs forming a cloak of shadows around the shadowcaster. The cloak of shadows is a 10' radius effect anywhere except full natural daylight where it's reduced to 5'. The shadowcaster has full concealment against anyone outside the cloak of shadow but his vision is unimpaired. Illusions whose area effect is within the cloak of shadow are partially real and much more difficult to disbelieve. The DC to disbelieve illusions within the cloak increases by 2 and any quasi real effects are 20%% more real than normal (this supersedes but does not stack with Deeper Shadows or any other similar ability) as long as they remain within the cloak. The cloak of shadows lowers the ambient light level by one level and is equivalent to a 9th level effect for the purposes of raising the light level. A shadowcaster can suppress this effect at will.
This ability replaces bend reality.
KNIGHT ARCHETYPES
Sentinel
Many knights believe the tower shield is a tool suitable only for troops on the battlefield, claiming it is too large and bulky to use in skirmishes or within dungeon corridors. Sentinels defy those notions, using their massive shields with startling skill and incredible effect. They use these seemingly clumsy shields to perform deft maneuvers that confound their enemies.
The sentinel is an archetype of the knight class.

This ability replaces fortress of defense.
Immediate Repositioning (Ex): At 13th level, as an immediate action, a sentinel can reposition his tower shield to another facing, but he cannot use this ability to interrupt an attack.

Tactician
While many knights focus on the fundamentals of melee and ranged combat, there are those who are trained to view the bigger picture on the battlefield. These knights use their training and tactical acumen to overcome challenges that would overwhelm mere brute strength and skill at arms.
# 300 of 907
The tactician is an archetype of the knight class.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A tactician is not proficient with heavy armor or tower shields.
Strategic Training (Ex): A tactician gains 4 skill ranks + a number of skill ranks equal to his Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of the normal 2 skill ranks + Intelligence modifier at each level.

This ability replaces shield buffet.
Battle Insight (Ex): At 15th level, as a swift action, a tactician can grant his Intelligence modifier as an insight bonus on the attack rolls made by a single ally within line of sight that can both see and hear the tactician.

This ability replaces maneuver training.
Improved Diminutive Grace (Ex): At 5th level, a diminutive adept's ability to avoid attacks of opportunity against those he passes improves. When using the Acrobatics skill to avoid attacks of opportunity, while moving through a threatened area or through an enemy's space, he takes no penalty when doing so at full speed.

Through discipline and training, an ironskin monk hardens his body to withstand punishing blows. Though slow on his feet, his calloused hands and feet can shatter stone and stagger foes.
The ironskin monk is an archetype of the monk class, available only to galka monks.
Iron Skin (Ex): At 1st level, an ironskin monk gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus stacks with any existing natural armor the ironskin monk already has. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1.
This ability replaces the monk's AC bonus ability and the ability to add his Wisdom bonus to his AC.
Resilience (Ex): At 2nd level, an ironskin monk can shake off the physical effects of certain attacks.

This ability replaces leap from the heavens.
# 302 of 907
Tough as Nails (Ex): At 6th level, an ironskin monk gains DR 1/-. Subtract 1 point from the damage the ironskin monk takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack.

Defensive Aid (Ex): At 2nd level, a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus, a nimble guardian can interpose herself between one adjacent ally and an attack or damage dealt in an area of effect.

# 303 of 907

Doing so is not an action.
This ability replaces the Boost ability.
Evasion (Ex): At 9th level, a nimble guardian gains evasion.
This ability replaces improved evasion.
Pugilist
Not all people of the fist walk the way of enlightenment. Some of the best bare-knuckled fighters are found in your local inn. A pugilist is nothing more than a skilled hand to hand specialist. There are many kinds of pugilists in the world. Some study like monks, others were born in a world that forced them to acquire the skills they needed to protect what they have. Some others might just be out there testing their own limits. Stubborn by nature, a pugilist is a person who refuses to believe he is outmatched by armed foes. Fighting is their life and pushing past the ability of others of their race is what drives them to become what they are.
The pugilist is an archetype of the monk class, available only to bangaa monks.
Prerequisite: The pugilist must have the thick-skinned racial trait for bangaas.
Exploit Weakness (Ex): At 1st level, as a swift action, a pugilist can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by making a Wisdom check and adding his monk level against a DC of 10 + the object's hardness or the target's CR. If the check succeeds, the pugilist gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls until the end of his turn, and any attacks he makes until the end of his turn ignore the creature or object's DR or hardness. A pugilist may instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saves and a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 his monk level until the start of his next turn.
This ability replaces flurry of blows.

Speed and agility are key to the pugilist abilities. Training all the time even when doing mundane tasks, a pugilist has a one track mind. The pugilist doesn't often push to make friends, but gets into the habit of helping people over and over again, mainly to test their own abilities. Cold and calculating a pugilist looks past emotions and accounts for the facts.
This ability replaces all martial arts style masteries.
# 304 of 907

He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the pugilist strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the pugilist can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the pugilist merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A pugilist can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a pugilist uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.
Battle Calculus (Ex): Starting at 18th level, a pugilist has seen virtually every martial application, and knows how to counter each and every foe effortlessly. As a free action once per round, a pugilist may force one opponent to reroll any one roll and take the lower result. A pugilist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier.
Roll with it (Ex): At 4th level, the aggression placed upon the pugilist forces him to learn to roll with the punches or be killed by his armed foes. The pugilist gains damage reduction 1/- and it increases by +1 every four levels (2/- at 8th level, 3/- at 12th level, 4/- at 16th level, and 5/- at 20th level.) A pugilist loses this ability if he wears medium or heavy armor or is carrying a medium or heavy load.
These abilities replaces all slow fall abilities.
Tempered (Ex): At 13th level, a pugilist can use physical resilience to avoid certain attacks. If the pugilist makes a Fortitude saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. Tempered can be used only if a pugilist is not wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load.
This ability replaces diamond soul.

At 17th level, the range of this tremorsense increases to 30 feet.
This ability replaces diamond soul.
Entomb (Su): At 15th level, a student of stone can phase a foe into solid rock, killing it instantly. To use this ability, he expends 1 ki point as part of a bull rush or reposition combat maneuver against a creature adjacent to unworked earth or stone. If the attempt succeeds, the student of stone pushes his foe inside the rock using his earth glide ability. If the creature succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the student of stone's monk level + the student of stone's Wisdom modifier), it is ejected in the nearest open space and takes 5d6 points of earth damage. If it fails, it dies instantly as its body merges with the surrounding stone. Entomb is usable once per day, but a failed bull rush or reposition attempt does not count as a use of the ability. Entomb has no effect on creatures that can earth glide, are incorporeal, or can otherwise can survive merging with a solid object.
This ability replaces defensive roll.
Stone Self (Ex): At 20th level, a student of stone becomes an outsider with the earth subtype. He gains DR 5/chaotic, burrow speed 20 feet, and tremorsense 20 feet.

The necrotic healer must suffer the full effects of the condition transferred for 1d3 rounds or for the condition's original duration, whichever is shorter. These effects cannot be reduced or negated in any way. If multiple conditions affect a targeted creature, the necrotic healer chooses which condition to remove. A necrotic healer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.
This ability replaces channel dark energy.
White Necromancy (Su): Beginning at 4th level, any necromancy spell that creates undead loses the evil descriptor when cast by a necrotic healer.
Mindless undead resulting from white necromancy are of neutral alignment. The alignment of intelligent undead exactly matches the necrotic healer's alignment.
The necrotic healer gains no specific control over undead created using white necromancy, although he may ask the undead to provide some service or to otherwise assist him. To make such a request, the necrotic healer must make a special Diplomacy check, rolling 1d20 + the necrotic healer's level + his Charisma modifier.
Mindless undead created through white necromancy initially are indifferent toward the necrotic healer, and a flat DC 15 Diplomacy check is required when requesting their assistance. Intelligent undead initially are friendly toward the necrotic healer, and a flat DC 15 + the creature's Charisma modifier is required when requesting their assistance.
A necrotic healer must treat any undead created through white necromancy with honor and respect at all times. In most cases, a necrotic healer should agree to release the undead once the requested service or task has been completed. Intelligent undead created through white necromancy might agree to follow the necrotic healer for a prolonged period of time. In such cases, the undead would certainly expect to be treated as an honored and respected companion, and might even occasionally make requests of its own.
A necrotic healer who fails to properly respect any undead he creates suffers a -10 to Diplomacy and similar skill checks when making new requests of that undead, subject to the GM's discretion.
This ability replaces unholy fortitude.
Enhanced Healing (Su): At 7th level, all of the necrotic healer's cure spells (spells with the word “cure” in the name) are treated as if they were empowered, increasing the amount of damage healed by half (+50%%). This
# 310 of 907
does not apply to damage dealt to undead with a cure spell, and it does not stack with the Empower Spell metamagic feat.
This ability replaces cheat death.
Necromancer's Sacrifice (Su): Beginning at 9th level, when an ally within 60 ft. is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, a necrotic healer can, as an immediate action, magically transfer the resulting wounds and/ or effects to himself instead of the target. The necrotic healer is affected as if he was hit by the attack or failed the saving throw and takes all the damage and suffers all of the adverse effects of doing so. Any resistances or immunities the necrotic healer has are applied normally, but he cannot otherwise reduce or negate the damage or effects in any way. If this ability is used against an effect that also targets the necrotic healer or includes him in its area, the necrotic healer suffers the effects for both himself and the target he spared, potentially taking damage or suffering other consequences twice.
A necrotic healer may use this ability once per day at 9th level and one additional time per day for three every additional necrotic healer level (twice per day at 12th level, three times per day at 15th level, and so on).
This ability replaces miasma.
Protective Aura (Su): At 17th level, the necrotic healer can, as an immediate action, emit a 30-ft. aura that protects against death effects for a number of rounds per day equal to his necromancer level. Living creatures within this area are immune to all death spells, death effects, energy drain, and effects that cause negative levels. This protective aura does not remove negative levels that a creature has already gained, but the negative levels have no effect while the creature is inside the protected area. These rounds need not be consecutive.
This ability replaces deathly abeyance.
RED MAGE ARCHETYPES
Elemental Knight
Elemental knights are born with elemental energies surging through their blood and discover the secret of reconciling and focusing this primal power into the arcane.
The elemental knight is an archetype of the red mage class, available to nu mou red mages.
Elemental Arcana (Su): At 3rd level, elemental knights may select the following ruby arcana available only to them.
Assault Synergy (Su): As a swift action, the elemental knight can expend 1 round of duration from elemental assault to add +1d6 points of energy damage to an offensive spell he casts that round. The spell must have the earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind descriptor. This extra energy damage matches the energy damage of the spell. At 10th level, he may expend 2 rounds instead of 1 to add +2d6 points of energy damage to the spell.
Energy Reflection (Su): This functions like the reflection ruby arcana, except it only works on spells that deal earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind damage. As long as the elemental knight spends at least 1 point from her arcane pool to activate this arcana, he may expend rounds of elemental assault as if they were arcane pool points. For example, the elemental knight could spend 1 arcane pool point and 3 rounds of elemental assault to reflect a spell of 4th-level or lower. The elemental knight must be at least 12th level before selecting this arcana.
# 311 of 907

This ability replaces quick cast.

The generalist is an archetype of the red mage class, available only to hume red mages.
Power or Speed (Ex): At 1st level, a generalist begins learning how to control herself and by extension, the flow of combat.

This ability replaces spellstrike.
Magic Mastery (Ex): At 4th level, the generalist continues their mastery on controlling every aspect of their being, learning how to better utilize their magic.

When casting a healing or enhancing spell on an ally they can make a single weapon attack on the foe closest to them if within range. At 16th level, this ability gains an insight bonus on attack and damage equal to the level of the spell cast prior to it.
# 312 of 907
This ability replaces improved spell combat and counterstrike.
Aspect of the Ruby (Su): At 10th level, the generalist hits a new milestone when it comes to full coverage. At the cost of an arcane point, a swift action, and MP equal to the highest spell level they know, the generalist can emulate one of three aspects perfectly for a number of rounds equal to their Charisma modifier.
? Shield (Su): The generalist gains a bonus to AC equal to the MP expended when using this ability, and half that bonus (rounded down) to all saving throws.
? Staff (Su): The generalist gains a bonus to their ruby knowledge bonus equal to the MP expended when using this ability, and half this bonus is added to spell resistance checks and red mage spell save DCs.
? Sword (Su): The generalist gets a bonus to attack and damage rolls with a held weapon equal to the MP expended when using this ability. Their held weapons' critical threat range is increased by half this bonus (rounded down). This does not stack with other abilities that increase a weapon's critical threat range.
This ability replaces jack-of-all-trades.
Renaissance Man (Ex): At 14th level, the generalist makes 'Jack-of-all-Trades' look like a dunce and laughs in his face about it. When making an untrained skill check or using the multitalented ability, the generalist can act as if she had a number of ranks in the skill equal to half her class level, and benefits from a +3 bonus as if it were a class skill.
This ability replaces greater spell combat.
Generalist Mastery (Ex): At 20th level, the generalist doesn't care about any one aspect of their character to exemplify it above the rest. When using power or speed, magic mastery, or spellblade, the bonuses gained are all increased by +3.
This ability replaces red wizard.
Red Warrior

The red warrior is an archetype of the red mage class.
Limit Breaks (Su): At 1st level, the red warrior receives the Limit Breaks (Aegis Shield and Arcane Savant).
Aegis Shield (Su): This Limit Break allows the red warrior to create a glowing, floating red shield that helps deflects attacks. For a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four red mage levels, this limit break grants the red warrior and any adjacent allies a +2 shield bonus to AC as well as a damage reduction of 2/-. These bonuses increases by 2 for every four red mage levels attained. This limit break requires only a swift action.
Arcane Savant (Su): This Limit Break allows the red warrior to spend points from his arcane pool without expending them for a duration of 1 round + 1 round per four red mage levels.
These limit breaks replaces the red mage's standard limit breaks.
# 313 of 907
Arcane Pool (Su): At 1st level, the red warrior gains a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and enhance his weapon and shield. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to his red mage level + his Charisma modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when the red warrior rests for a full 8 hours.
At 1st level, a red warrior can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon and shield he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute, paying the arcane pool cost separately for each. For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon and shield gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon and shield stacking with existing weapon and shield enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.
At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal.

If the weapon and shield is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the red warrior uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon and shield are wielded by anyone other than the red warrior.
A red warrior can only enhance one weapon and one shield in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.
This ability replaces the Red Mage's spells class feature. Red warriors do not gain any spells or spellcasting ability, do not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger and spell completion magic items.
Arcane Deflection (Ex): Beginning of 1st level, the red warrior learns how to use his arcane pool to fight in melee combat. As long as the red warrior has at least one point in his arcane pool remaining, he gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1.
This ability replaces ruby knowledge.
Resilience (Su): Also at 1st level, as an immediate action, the red warrior may reduce the damage he is about to take by 5 hit points for every 1 point from his arcane pool he expends. The red warrior may not spend more points from his arcane pool than his red mage level per effect being reduced.

1 minute. A red warrior can use this ability three times per day. Activating this ability is a free action. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, the insight bonus to Strength and Constitution improves by +2.
This ability replaces red magery gained at 1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
Chain of Defensive Posture (Ex): At 2nd level, a red warrior learns the second principle of warfare for the individual combatant: the ability to avoid the enemy's counterattacks if that enemy is not immediately overwhelmed. Calling upon inner reserves of knowledge and dedication, a red warrior can provide himself with a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class for up to 1 minute. A red warrior can use this ability three times per day. Activating this ability is a free action. At 6th level, the insight bonus to Armor Class improves to +4.
This ability replaces quick learner (minor) gained at 2nd and 6th level.
Swap Places (Su): At 2nd level, as an immediate action and by expending 1 point from his arcane pool, a red warrior can swap places with an adjacent ally who is about to get attacked. Neither activating this ability nor the movement of the red warrior or his ally from this ability provoke attacks of opportunity. This occurs before the attack and the attacker must resolve the attack against the red warrior instead of the original target. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the red warrior gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against this attack.
This ability replaces Red Mage's arcane pool gained at 2nd level.
Enduring Body (Ex): At 3rd level, a red warrior learns the third principle of warfare for the individual combatant: to unleash in oneself the spirit of the enduring body. The spirit of the ideal body transforms a red warrior, granting him damage reduction 1/-. At 7th level, his damage reduction improves to 2/-. At 10th level, his damage reduction improves to 3/-.

Sweeping Strike (Ex): At 4th level, a red warrior gains the ability to make great, sweeping swings with a melee weapon. On each melee attack a red warrior makes, he can choose squares he threatens that are adjacent to each other, and his attacks apply to creatures in those two squares equally. A red warrior can use this ability on any attack, even an attack of opportunity or a cleave attempt.
A red warrior cannot use this ability if he has moved more than 10 feet since the end of his last turn. If a red warrior hits one or both of his foes with a sweeping strike, he can attempt a cleave normally; however, he makes only one cleave attempt per sweeping strike, even if he successfully hits more than one foe.
This ability replaces all quick cast abilities.
Convert (Ex): Beginning of 5th level, a red warrior can convert hit points into arcane points as a free action. For every 5 hit points converted, the red warrior receives 1 arcane point. The red warrior cannot convert below 1 hit point and can only convert arcane points equal to his red mage level. The red warrior can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier.
# 315 of 907
This ability modifies and replaces the Red Mage's convert ability.
Dual Effect (Ex): At 8th level, the red warrior's resilience ability has become almost second nature. Any time the red warrior uses Swap Places or In Harm's Way (see below), he can also use Resilience in the same immediate action.
This ability replaces improved spell combat.
Clear Mind (Ex): At 10th level, a red warrior can regain his arcane pool quicker. The red warrior must be relaxed and must be free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other loud noises. The red warrior regains 1 arcane point per hour.
This ability modifies and replaces the Red Mage's clear mind ability.
Well of Power (Ex): At 10th level, a red warrior can tap his arcane pool to use chain of personal superiority or chain of defensive posture more than would normally be possible. If he has already expended all of his daily uses of either chain of personal superiority or chain of defense posture, he may spend 1 point from his arcane pool to gain an additional use of either ability. He can do this as many times as he wants in a day, provided he has points in his arcane pool left. At 14th level, he can expend 2 points from his arcane pool to gain an additional daily use of chain of overwhelming force if he has already expended his daily use.
This ability replaces quick learner (moderate) gained at 10th and 14th level.
Chain of Overwhelming Force (Su): At 14th level, a red warrior learns the fourth principle of warfare for the individual combatant: to discover the underlying violence of the world and deliver it in a perfectly executed attack.
The red warrior taps into this underlying energy and apply it to a single melee attack, dealing an extra 10d6 points of damage. A red warrior can use this ability once per day. Activating this ability is part of the attack action. If the attack misses, the ability is wasted.
This ability replaces greater spell combat.
In Harm's Way (Su): At 15th level, a red warrior can absorb effects that would affect an ally within his reach. The red warrior may expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate action to take the effect of an area effect that would have hit his ally, although he is affected as normal if he is also in the area of effect.
This ability replaces doublecast.
Counterattack (Ex): At 16th level, a red warrior can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who hits an ally adjacent to the red warrior with a melee attack, so long as the attacking creature is within the red warrior's reach.
This ability replaces counterstrike.
Retributive Attack (Ex): At 18th level, if an adjacent ally of a red warrior is rendered helpless or unconscious, the red warrior can make a retributive attack against the creature that felled his ally. When making a retributive attack, the red warrior adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage
# 316 of 907
per red mage level on a successful hit. A red warrior can make a number of retributive attacks per day equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum of one), but never more than once per round. He may make more than one retributive attack against the same foe.
This ability replaces 1 MP.
Mighty Resilience (Ex): At 19th level, the red warrior automatically negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from Blinding Critical or bleed from sneak attack) if the red warrior has 1 point in his arcane pool remaining. The red warrior takes only normal damage from the attack.
This ability replaces quick learner (major).
Red Knight (Su): At 20th level, once per day as a free action, the red warrior can enter into a very powerful Trance. As long as he has 1 point in his arcane pool remaining, for up to 5 minutes the red warrior adds his Charisma modifier to his attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, skill checks, ability checks, saves, and initiative, and he increases his speed by +5 feet for every point of his Charisma modifier.
This ability replaces red wizard.
Sage
The red mage trades in his martial talent for the art of mastering black and white magic. The red mage uses his brains over his brawn to defeat his enemies.
The sage is an archetype of the red mage class.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A sage is proficient with simple weapons only. He can cast red mage spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal spell failure chance. Like any other spellcaster, a sage wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of spell failure. A multiclass sage still incurs the normal spell failure chance for spells received from other classes.
This replaces the normal red mage weapon and armor proficiency feature.
Ruby Scholar I (Sp): A sage of 3rd level may select two 2nd level spells, one each from the black mage and white mage spell lists. The sage can cast these spells as a spell-like ability by expending two points of his Arcane Pool. The sage uses his red mage caster level and Intelligence modifier to determine its effects.
This ability replaces the red mage's Ruby Arcana ability at 3rd level.
Ruby Scholar II (Sp): A sage of 6th level may select two 3rd level spells, one each from the black mage and white mage spell lists. The sage can cast these spells as a spell-like ability by expending three points of his Arcane Pool. The sage uses his red mage caster level and Intelligence modifier to determine its effects.
This ability replaces the red mage's Ruby Arcana ability at 6th level.
Master Scholar (Ex): At 7th level, a sage adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks. He can always take 10 on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks, even if distracted or endangered.
# 317 of 907
This ability replaces the red mage's Armored Mage (Medium) and Armored Mage (shield) abilities.
Ruby Scholar III (Sp): A sage of 9th level may select two 4th level spells, one each from the black mage and white mage spell lists. The sage can cast these spells as a spell-like ability by expending four points of his Arcane Pool. The sage uses his red mage caster level and Intelligence modifier to determine its effects.
This ability replaces the red mage's Ruby Arcana ability at 9th level.
Ruby Scholar IV (Sp): A sage of 12th level may select two 5th level spells, one each from the black mage and white mage spell lists. The sage can cast these spells as a spell-like ability by expending five points of his Arcane Pool. The sage uses his red mage caster level and Intelligence modifier to determine its effects.
This ability replaces the red mage's Ruby Arcana ability at 12th level.
Ruby Scholar V (Sp): A sage of 15th level may select two 6th level spells, one each from the black mage and white mage spell lists. The sage can cast these spells as a spell-like ability by expending six points of his Arcane Pool. The sage uses his red mage caster level and Intelligence modifier to determine its effects.
This ability replaces the red mage's Ruby Arcana ability at 15th level.
Ruby Scholar VI (Sp): A sage of 18th level may select two 7th level spells, one each from the black mage and white mage spell lists. The sage can cast these spells as a spell-like ability by expending seven points of his Arcane Pool. The sage uses his red mage caster level and Intelligence modifier to determine its effects.
This ability replaces the red mage's Ruby Arcana ability at 18th level.
Spellblade
A spellblade can manifest a ghostly blade of force that can be used as an off-hand weapon.
The spellblade is an archetype of the red mage class.
Force Blade (Su): At 2nd level, a spellblade can spend MP up to the spell level that he can cast as a swift action to create a dagger of force in his off hand. The force blade lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed, has an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls equal to the MP spent (maximum +5), and is considered a weapon the spellblade is holding for purposes of his arcane pool feature (using the pool to add abilities to a held weapon applies to the red mage's physical weapon and to the force blade for no additional cost). The force blade acts as a dagger, but the hand holding it is still considered free for the purpose of casting spells and delivering touch attacks. The red mage can use the force blade as if he were fighting with two weapons, or can use that hand to cast spells as part of the spell combat class ability (but not both in the same round). Attacks with the force blade are force attacks and deal force damage.
This ability replaces the spellstrike class feature.
Spellblade Arcana
A spellblade gains access to the following ruby arcana. He cannot select any arcana more than once.
# 318 of 907
Pool-Sourced Blade (Su): Instead of spending MP to create the force blade, the spellblade can spend points from his arcane pool to do so. A force blade created this way has an enhancement bonus equal to the number of arcane pool points spent (maximum +5).
Spellblade Parry (Su): When an enemy makes a melee attack roll against the red mage, as an immediate action the red mage can end the force blade's duration to gain a deflection bonus to his Armor Class until the end of his next turn. This bonus is equal to the MP spent to create the force blade (maximum +5).
Throw Blade (Su): As a standard action, a spellblade can throw his force blade up to 60 feet as a ranged attack (no range penalty). If the force blade misses, it returns automatically to the spellblade's hand just before his next turn. If the force blade hits, it deals damage and its duration ends; the spellblade can choose to spend up to 2 points from his arcane pool to increase the thrown force blade's damage by +1d6 for each point spent.
Ruby Arcana: The following ruby arcana complement the spellblade archetype: hasted assault, pool strike, and spell shield.
Spell Dancer
The strong emphasis on mages within elvaan culture influences how even non-mage elvaans see themselves. Many elvaan mages do not consider themselves masters of a blend of martial and magical talents, but rather a sub-category of mages who study the effect of physical movement and techniques upon spellcasting ability. They believe their ability to cast spells while fighting is an outgrowth of the concept of the “spell dance,” which itself is just another kind of magery.
The spell dancer is an archetype of the red mage class, available only to elvaan red mages.
Class Skills: A spell dancer adds Acrobatics and Perform (dance) to his list of class skills and removes Intimidate and Ride from his list of class skills.
Spell Dance (Su): At 1st level, a spell dancer gains the ability to expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to his movement rate and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through threatened spaces for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the spell dancer gains another +10 enhancement bonus to movement and +2 to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked from movement. At 5th level, once per spell dance as a swift action, the spell dancer may use one of the following on himself as a swift action: blur, fly, or haste. These abilities last for 1 round. At 9th level, the spell dancer may instead take a swift action to use hop as a spell-like ability once during a spelldance. At 13th level, the spell dancer may instead choose to take a swift action to gain freedom of movement for 1d4 rounds.
This ability replaces the red mage's ability to expend points from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding magic bonuses for 1 minute.
Arcane Movement (Su): At 5th level, whenever a spell dancer casts a red mage spell, he gains a competence bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, and Stealth checks equal to the spell's level until the beginning of his next turn.
This ability replaces the red magery a red mage receives at 5th level.
Dance of Avoidance (Su): At 7th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer gains a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class.
# 319 of 907
This ability replaces the armored mage (medium) class feature.
Greater Dance of Avoidance (Su): At 10th level, while wearing light armor or no armor, a spell dancer's insight bonus to Armor Class increases to +4.
This ability replaces the armored mage (shield) class feature.
Red Mage Arcana: The following red mage arcana complement the spell dancer archetype: arcane cloak, prescient defense, close range, concentrate, hasted assault, spell shield.
SUMMONER ARCHETYPES
Caller
Most summoners forge a bond with a single, powerful avatar, but some summoners seek to control a variety of creatures. The caller sacrifices the power of his avatar in favor of summoning a plethora of otherworldly creatures to aid him.
The caller is an archetype of the summoner class.
Lesser Avatar: A caller's class level is halved (minimum 1) for the purposes of determining his avatar's abilities, Hit Dice, and so on. The avatar otherwise functions as normal.
This ability replaces the summoner's normal avatar ability.
Summoning Mastery (Sp): Starting at 2nd level, a caller can cast summon monster I as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 5 + his Charisma modifier. The summoner can use this ability when his avatar is summoned. Only one summon monster spell may be in effect while the avatar is summoned. If the summoner's avatar is not summoned, the number of creatures that can be summoned with this ability is only limited by its uses per day. This ability otherwise functions as the summoner's normal summon monster I ability. Other than these restrictions, there is no limit to how many summon monster spells the summoner can have active at one time.
This ability replaces the summoner's normal summon monster I ability and shield ally.
Augment Summoning: At 3rd level, a caller gains Augment Summoning as a bonus feat. He does not have to meet any requirements for this feat.
This ability replaces bond senses.
Evoker
Some evokers choose to summon a planar creature rather than an aspect of a primal or deity.
The evoker is an archetype of the summoner class.
Esper (Su): At 1st level, an evoker has the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an esper. The esper forms a link with the evoker, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An esper has the same alignment as the evoker that calls it and can speak all of his languages. Espers are treated as
# 320 of 907
summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its evoker, an esper can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures.
An evoker can summon his esper in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the esper hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The esper remains until dismissed by the evoker (a standard action). If the evoker is unconscious, asleep, or killed, his esper is immediately banished. The esper takes a form shaped by the evoker's desires. The esper's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities are tied to the evoker's class level and increase as the evoker gains levels. In addition, each esper receives a pool of evolution points, based on the evoker's level, which can be used to give the esper different abilities and powers. Whenever the evoker gains a level, he must decide how these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another level of evoker.
The esper's physical appearance is up to the evoker, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. This control is not fine enough to make the esper appear like a specific creature. The esper also bears a glowing rune that is identical to a rune that appears on the evoker's forehead as long as the esper is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance.
This ability modifies and replaces avatar.
Mutate Esper (Su): At 9th level, an evoker can change his esper's evolutions as if he had gained a level. To mutate his esper, the evoker must perform an arcane ritual that requires 8 hours of uninterrupted concentration and costs 200 gil per summoner level in material components.
This ability replaces transposition.
Evolve Base Form (Su): Starting at 15th level, whenever the evoker gains a level, he can change his esper's base form to a new base form. Once chosen, this base form is set until the evoker gains another summoner level.
This ability replaces paragon summons.
Twin Esper (Su): At 20th level, an evoker and his esper share a true connection. As a standard action, the evoker can assume the shape of his esper, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his esper. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The evoker loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his esper's evolutions. The evoker retains all of his class features. The evoker can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his evoker level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The evoker can end this effect as a free action.
This ability modifies and replaces twin avatar.
Espers
An esper's abilities are determined by the summoner's level and by the choices made using its evolution pool. Table 3-17: Esper Base Statistics determines many of the base statistics of the esper. Each esper possesses a
# 321 of 907
base form that modifies these base statistics. Espers are outsiders for the purpose of determining which spells affect them.

Special: This includes a number of abilities gained by all espers as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.
? Darkvision (Ex): The esper has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
? Link (Ex): An evoker and his esper share a mental link allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing the evoker to give orders to his esper at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with the evoker's connection to his esper. As a result, the evoker and his esper share magic item slots. For example, if the evoker is wearing a ring, his esper can wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by the evoker remain active, and those used by the esper become dormant. The esper must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.
? Evasion (Ex): If an esper is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.
? Ability Score Increase (Ex): The esper adds +1 to one of its ability scores.
? Devotion (Ex): An esper gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.
? Multiattack: An esper gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has 3 or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more natural attacks (or it is reduced to less than 3 attacks), the esper instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a -5 penalty. If the esper later gains 3 or more natural attacks, it loses this additional attack and instead gains Multiattack.
? Improved Evasion (Ex): When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an esper takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.

Esper Base Forms
Each esper has one of four base forms that determines its starting size, speed, AC, attacks, and ability scores. All natural attacks are made using the esper's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted (such as in the case of secondary attacks). Esper attacks add the esper's Strength modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. These base forms also note any free evolutions that base form possesses. The bonuses from these free evolutions are already factored into the starting statistics. Alternatively, any one of these base forms can be used to make a Small esper. If the esper is Small, it gains a +2 bonus to its Dexterity score. It also takes a -4 penalty to its Strength and a -2 penalty to its Constitution. It also gains a +1 size bonus to its AC and attack rolls, and a +4 bonus on its Stealth skill checks. Reduce the damage of all of its attacks by one step (1d6 becomes 1d4, 1d4 becomes 1d3). If this choice is made, the esper can be made Medium whenever the evoker can change the esper's evolution pool (which causes it to lose these modifiers for being Small).

Evolutions
Each esper receives a number of evolution points that can be spent to give the esper new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the esper have a specific base form or the evoker be of a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the esper additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using the esper's full base attack bonus and add the esper's Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as secondary are made using the esper's base attack bonus - 5 and add 1/2 the esper's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the esper only has a single natural attack, the attack is made using its full base attack bonus and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on
# 324 of 907
damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack's type. Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the points must be spent whenever the evoker gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can only be selected once.
1-Point Evolutions: The following evolutions cost 1 point from the esper's evolution pool.
Bite (Ex): An esper's maw is full of razor-sharp teeth, giving it a bite attack. This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). If the esper already has a bite attack, this evolution allows it to deal 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with its bite.
Claws (Ex): An esper has a pair of vicious claws at the end of its limbs, giving it two claw attacks. These attacks are primary attacks. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The esper must have the limbs evolution to take this evolution. This evolution can only be applied to the limbs (legs) evolution once. This evolution can be selected more than once, but the esper must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution.
Climb (Ex): An esper becomes a skilled climber, gaining a climb speed equal to its base speed. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each additional time it is selected, increase the esper's climb speed by 20 feet.
Improved Damage (Ex): One of the esper's natural attacks is particularly deadly. Select one natural attack form and increase the damage die type by one step. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an esper selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack.

Pincers (Ex): An esper grows a large pincers at the end of one pair of its limbs, giving it two pincer attacks. These attacks are secondary attacks. The pincers deal 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). Espers with the grab evolution linked to pincers gain a +2 bonus on grapple checks. The esper must have the limbs (arms) evolution to take this evolution. Alternatively, the esper can replace the claws from its base form with pincers (this still costs 1 evolution point). This evolution can be selected more than once, but the esper must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution.
Pounce (Ex): An esper gains quick reflexes, allowing it to make a full attack after a charge. This evolution is only available to espers of the quadruped base form.

Pick one elemental type (dark, earth, fire, ice, light, lightning, water, or wind). The esper gains elemental resistance 5 against that elemental type. This resistance increases by 5 for every 5 levels the summoner possesses, to a maximum of 15 at 10th level. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an esper selects this evolution, it applies to a different outsider type.
Scent (Ex): An esper's sense of smell becomes quite acute. The esper gains the scent special quality, allowing it to detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can be detected at twice the normal range. Scent does not allow the
# 325 of 907
esper to precisely locate the creature, only to detect its presence. It can detect the direction with a move action. The esper can pinpoint the creature's location if it is within 5 feet. The esper can use scent to track creatures.

Slam (Ex): An esper can deliver a devastating slam attack. This attack is a primary attack. The slam deals 1d8 points of damage (2d6 if Large, 2d8 if Huge). The esper must have the limbs (arms) evolution to take this evolution. Alternatively, the esper can replace the claws from its base form with this slam attack (this still costs 1 evolution point). This evolution can be selected more than once, but the esper must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution.
Sting (Ex): An esper possesses a long, barbed stinger at the end of its tail, granting it a sting attack. This attack is a primary attack. The sting deals 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The esper must possess the tail evolution to take this evolution.

Limbs (Ex): An esper grows an additional pair of limbs. These limbs can take one of two forms. They can be made into legs, complete with feet. Each pair of legs increases the esper's base speed by 10 feet. Alternatively, they can be made into arms, complete with hands. The esper does not gain any additional natural attacks for an additional pair of arms, but it can take other evolutions that add additional attacks (such as claws or a slam). Arms that have hands can be used to wield weapons, if the esper is proficient. This evolution can be selected more than once.
Minor Magic (Sp): An esper learns to cast a minor spell as a spell-like ability. Select one spell from the following list: air bubble, cure, disappear (self only), dread, flame breath, frostbite, or silent image. This spell can be cast once per day as a spell-like ability. At 7th level, this spell can be cast three times per day by spending 2 additional evolution points. The caster level for this evolution is equal to the esper's Hit Dice - 2. The save DC for this spell is 10 + 1/2 the esper's HD + the esper's Charisma modifier. The esper must have a Charisma score of at least 11 and must possess the basic magic evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 4th level before selecting this evolution.

The summoner must be at least 4th level before selecting this evolution.
Rend (Ex): An esper learns to rip and tear the flesh of those it attacks with its claws, gaining the rend ability. Whenever the esper makes two successful claw attacks against the same target in 1 round, its claws latch onto the flesh and deal extra damage. This damage is equal to the damage dealt by one claw attack plus 1-1/2 times the esper's Strength modifier. The esper must possess the claws evolution to select this evolution. The summoner must be at least 6th level before selecting this evolution.
Shadow Blend (Su): In any condition of illumination other than bright light, the esper disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (20%% miss chance). If it has the shadow form evolution, it instead gains total concealment (50%% miss chance). The esper can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
Shadow Form (Su): The esper's body becomes shadowy and more indistinct. This shadow form grants the esper constant concealment (20%% miss chance), and its melee attacks affect incorporeal creatures as if it had the ghost touch weapon property. The esper's melee attacks deal only half damage to corporeal creatures.
Trample (Ex): An esper gains the ability to crush its foes underfoot, gaining the trample ability. As a full-round action, the esper can overrun any creature that is at least one size smaller than itself.

The creatures take 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the esper's Strength modifier. Targets of the trample can make attacks of opportunity at a -4 penalty. If a target forgoes the attack of opportunity, it can make a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the esper's HD + the esper's Strength modifier. A trampling esper can only deal trampling damage to a creature once per round. This evolution is only available to espers of the biped or quadruped base forms.
Tremorsense (Ex): An esper becomes attuned to vibrations in the ground, gaining tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.

The esper must possess the bite evolution to select this evolution.
Undead Appearance (Ex): An esper appears as an undead creature, and mimics some of an undead creature's abilities and weaknesses. Negative energy heals the esper, and positive energy (including a cleric's channel energy ability) harms it.

The esper gains a +2 bonus on saves against disease, exhaustion, fatigue, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. At 7th level, this bonus on saves can be increased to +4 by spending 2 additional evolution points. At 12th level, this protection can be increased to immunity against these attacks by spending 2 additional evolution points (the summoner must pay for the 7th-level upgrade before paying for this 12th-level upgrade). Although the esper appears undead, it is still an outsider.

3-Point Evolutions: The following evolutions cost 3 points from the esper's evolution pool.
Blindsense (Ex): An esper's senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the esper to pinpoint the location of creatures that it cannot see without having to make a Perception check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the esper.

The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.
Burrow (Ex): An esper grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through the earth. The esper gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed.

Frightful Presence (Ex): An esper becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The esper can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the esper must make a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the esper's HD + the esper's Charisma modifier. If the esper has at least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent, that opponent becomes frightened instead. Foes with more HD than the esper are immune to this effect. The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.
Major Magic (Sp): An esper learns to cast a major spell as a spell-like ability. Select one spell from the following list: burning arc, cure II, darkness, defensive shock, restore, levitate, minor image, see invisibility, vanish (self only), or wall climb.

The caster level for this evolution is equal to the esper's Hit Dice - 2. The save DC for this spell is 10 + 1/2 the esper's HD + the esper's Charisma modifier. The esper must have a Charisma score of at least 12 and must possess the minor magic evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting this evolution. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each time an esper selects this evolution, it applies to a new spell from the above list.
Sacrifice (Su): An esper can sacrifice its own health to heal another creature. As a standard action, the esper can sacrifice up to 2 hit points per Hit Die and then touch the target creature, thereby healing the creature for half the amount sacrificed.
See in Darkness (Su): An esper can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by deeper darkness. The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.
Swallow Whole (Ex): An esper gains the swallow whole ability, giving it the ability to consume its foes. If the esper begins its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab evolution), it can attempt a grapple check to swallow the creature. The creature can be up to one size category smaller than the esper. Swallowed creatures take damage equal to the esper's bite damage each round plus 1d6 points of bludgeoning
# 329 of 907
damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light slashing or piercing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the esper's total hit points. The esper's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the esper loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has returned to the esper's mouth, where it can attempt to escape or be swallowed again. The esper must possess the grab evolution, tied to a bite attack, to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.
Web (Ex): An esper gains a pair of spinnerets, giving it the ability to spin webs. The esper can use these webs to support itself plus up to one creature of the same size. It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to 8 times per day, entangling a creature up to one size larger than the esper. The webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with an Escape Artist check or a Strength check (at a -4 penalty). The DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the esper's HD + the esper's Con modifier. The webs have a Hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the esper's total Hit Dice. The esper can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can pinpoint any creature touching its webs. The esper must possess the climb evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting this evolution.
4-Point Evolutions: The following evolutions cost 4 points from the esper's evolution pool.
Blindsight (Ex): An esper's senses sharpen even further, granting it blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. The esper can maneuver and attack as normal, ignoring darkness, invisibility, and most forms of concealment as long as it has line of effect to the target. The esper must possess the blindsense evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.
Breath Weapon (Su): An esper learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select either dark, earth, fire, ice, light, lightning, water, or wind. The esper can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the selected type per HD it possesses. Those caught in the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the esper's HD + the esper's Constitution modifier. The esper can use this ability once per day. The esper can use this ability 1 additional time per day by spending an additional 1 evolution point (maximum 3/day). The summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.
Fast Healing (Su): An esper's body gains the ability to heal wounds very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The esper heals 1 point of damage each round, just like natural healing. Fast healing does not allow the esper to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the esper is alive. This fast healing does not function when the esper is not on the same plane as its evoker. This healing can be increased by 1 per round for every 2 additional evolution points spent (maximum 5). The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.
Incorporeal Form (Sp): Once per day, an esper can become incorporeal for 1 round per summoner level. While in this form, the esper gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal quality. It only takes half damage from corporeal sources as long as they are magic (it takes no damage from nonmagical weapons and objects). Likewise, its spells or spell-like abilities deal only half damage to corporeal creatures. Spells and other effects that do not deal damage function normally. The summoner must be at least 15th level before selecting this evolution.
# 330 of 907
Large (Ex): An esper grows in size, becoming Large. The esper gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a -2 penalty to its Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a -1 size penalty to its AC and on attack rolls, and a -4 penalty on Stealth skill checks. If the esper has the biped base form, it also gains 10-foot reach. Any reach evolutions the esper possesses are added to this total. The esper must be Medium to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 8th level before selecting this evolution.
If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the esper instead becomes Huge. The esper gains a +16 bonus to Strength, a +8 bonus to Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a -4 penalty to its Dexterity. This size change also give the creature a -2 size penalty to its AC and attack rolls, 10-foot reach, and a -8 penalty on Stealth skill checks. If the esper has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet (10 feet for all other base forms). Any reach evolutions the esper possesses are added to this total. These bonuses and penalties replace, and do not stack with, those gained from becoming Large. The summoner must be at least 15th level before selecting this option.
The ability increase evolution costs twice as much (4 evolution points) when adding to the Strength or Constitution scores of a Large or Huge esper.
Lifesense (Su): An esper can pinpoint living creatures with ease. The esper notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight evolution. The esper must possess the undead appearance evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this evolution.
Limit Break (Su): The esper gains a Limit Break. Pick an area of effect: 30-ft.-cone, 60-ft.-line, or 30-ft.-burst. Select either dark, earth, fire, ice, light, lightning, water, or wind.

THIEF ARCHETYPES
Assassin A thief undertaking his task with cold, professional detachment, the assassin is equally adept at espionage, bounty hunting, and terrorism. At his core, an assassin is an artisan, and his medium is death. Trained in a variety of killing techniques, assassins are among the most feared killers.
The assassin is an archetype of the thief class.
Poison Use: Beginning of 1st level, assassins are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison themselves when applying poison to a blade (see Poison).
This ability replaces mark and trapfinding.
Save Bonus against Poison: At 2nd level, the assassin gains a +1 saving throw bonus against poisons. This bonus increase by +1 every two levels.
This ability replaces trap sense.
Hidden Weapons (Ex): At 3rd level, an assassin becomes a master at hiding weapons on his body. He adds his assassin level to all Sleight of Hand skill checks made to prevent others from noticing them.
This ability replaces measure the mark.
Death Attack (Ex): At 5th level, if an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). Studying the victim is a standard action. The death attack fails if the target detects the assassin or recognizes the assassin as an enemy (although the attack might still be a sneak attack if the target is denied his Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class or is flanked). If the victim of such a death attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.
If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.
This ability replaces improved theft.
True Death (Su): Starting at 7th level, anyone slain by an assassin's death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from the dead using raise or similar magic must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + the assassin's level or the spell fails. Casting dispel the round before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this chance. The DC of the dispel is 10 + the assassin's level.
This ability replaces skilled liar.
# 332 of 907
Quiet Death (Ex): At 10th level, whenever an assassin kills a creature using his death attack during a surprise round, he can also make a Stealth check, opposed by Perception checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from identifying him as the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not even notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing the assassin to avoid detection.
This ability replaces mug.
Swift Death (Ex): At 15th level, once per day, an assassin can make a death attack against a foe without studying the foe beforehand. He must still sneak attack his foe using a melee weapon that deals damage.
This ability replaces theft mastery.
Angel of Death (Su): At 20th level, the assassin becomes a master of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes a successful death attack, he can cause the target's body to crumble to dust. This prevents raise dead and resurrection (although true resurrection works as normal). The assassin must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against the death attack, this ability is wasted with no effect.
This ability replaces master strike.
Cat Burglar
Gifted with finesse and stealth, mithra make excellent burglars. Cat burglars are masters of breaking and entering, using their feline grace to make it seem as though no crime was ever committed in the first place. Few locks can withstand skilled cat burglars, and such nimble thieves are capable of bypassing traps without activating them and enabling associates to do the same.
The cat burglar is an archetype of the thief class, available only to mithra thieves.
Phantom Presence (Ex): At 4th level, a cat burglar masters stealthy movement and leaves no trace of her passing in dungeons and cities. While in dungeon and urban environments, she leaves no trail and cannot be tracked, though she can choose to leave behind a trail if she so desires. Furthermore, she can always choose to take 10 when making a Stealth check.
This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
Trap Saboteur (Su): At 8th level, a cat burglar becomes a master of avoiding and manipulating traps and locks. She can attempt to open a lock as a standard action and takes 1/2 the normal amount of time to disable traps (minimum 1 round). When she has bypassed a trap without disarming it, she can also choose to suppress its trigger for up to 1 minute. If she does, she can also choose to end this suppression prematurely as a free action.
This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.
Thief Talents: The following thief talents complement the cat burglar archetype: fast stealth, quick disable; convincing fakes, dodge trap; fast picks; terrain mastery.
Advanced Talents: The following advanced thief talents complement the cat burglar archetype: another day, fast tumble; hide in plain sight.

Bardic Performance (Su): At 2nd level, a deadly courtesan gains the bardic performance ability and the fascinate bardic performance. Her fascinate DC is 10 + 1/2 her thief level + her Charisma modifier. She can use this bardic performance for a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. At each level after 2nd, she can use bardic performance for 1 additional round per day. If the courtesan also has bard levels, she may use these rounds for either class's fascinate bardic performance, and her bard and thief levels stack for determining her fascinate DC.
This ability replaces the thief talent gained at 2nd level.
Inspire Competence (Su): At 3rd level, a deadly courtesan can use her bardic performance to inspire competence. The bonus begins at +2 and increases by +1 for every six levels the courtesan has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 9th and +4 at 15th).
This ability replaces all levels of trap sense.
Performance Strike (Sp): At 8th level, as a swift action, a deadly courtesan may expend rounds of bardic performance to gain a morale bonus on one attack roll. The amount of the bonus is equal to the number of bardic performance rounds expended (maximum bonus equal to 1/2 her deadly courtesan level).
This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

Quicker than the Eye (Ex): At 2nd level, a filcher develops an amazingly swift and delicate touch. When she uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a penalty on their Perception checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher's class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal -20 penalty when attempting to make a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action.
# 335 of 907

She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers. She gains a +1 bonus on Appraise checks and an additional +1 bonus every three levels thereafter.
As a swift action, a filcher can make an Appraise check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of ). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a -20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see.

Street Magician

Street performers, runaways from magic academies, or simply orphans with the knack, these street magicians study their simple tricks relentlessly. ‘Trained' mages may scoff at these simple magic-users and their street-trained magic, but a street magician knows better.

Dancing Weapons (Su): At 8th level, the forgemaster can give a weapon touched the dancing special weapon quality for 4 rounds. He can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th.
This ability replaces his 8th-level mage talent.
Netherseer
This white mage uses the power of darkness over the power of light. Choosing to wield the power of life and death is sometimes a hard choice to make.
The netherseer is an archetype of the white mage class.
Dark Magic: Netherseers gain access to all dark spells from the black mage spell list and lose access to all light spells from the white mage spell list, but is otherwise unchanged.
This ability modifies the white mage's spellcasting ability.
Unholy Burst (Su): At 2nd level, a netherseer can release a wave of dark energy that causes shadow damage to living creatures. Unholy burst affects all living creatures in a 15-foot radius centered on the netherseer. The amount of shadow damage dealt is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two netheseer levels beyond 2nd (2d6 at 4th, 3d6 at 6th, and so on). Living creatures that take damage from unholy burst receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the netherseer's level + the netherseer's Wisdom modifier. A netherseer may use unholy burst a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A netherseer can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect.
This ability replaces the Holy Burst ability.

Bolster Undead (Ex): Whenever the netherseer uses her Unholy Burst ability, any undead in the area of effect receives a +1 bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and damage rolls and an additional +1 per four netherseer levels for a duration of 1 round per level.
This mage talent replaces the Ward Undead mage talent ability.
Living Sacrifice (Su): At 20th level, the netherseer learns the rite of living sacrifice. With this powerful rite, the netherseer sacrifices a living creature - possibly even a sentient humanoid - and gains power through an energy transfer.
The netherseer must first cast her circle, then she and the creature to be sacrificed must be within the circle.
The creature to be sacrificed must be alive and in good health, but need not be awake and conscious (though many netherseers prefer the victim to be awake and conscious because of their evil natures). For 2 full hours, the netherseer must chant the required words to the rite, then using her boline (a sacred knife used for actual cutting) the netherseer slits the sacrificial victim's throat. As the creature dies, its life energy is transferred to the netherseer.
The netherseer gains bonus temporary hit points equal to the number of hit points of the sacrifice (maximum of 30 hit points). These bonus hit points fade at a rate of 1 hit point per day. The netherseer also receives a +2 bonus to her Wisdom and Charisma for 1 month.
The living sacrifice rite can only be performed once per month, and must be performed under a new moon.
If it is performed at any other time of the month, the rite does not work.
This ability replaces the White Wizard ability.
Templar
Templars serve the militant arm of a church, ready to stand guard over the religion's holy places and to be its swift, avenging arm against those who resist its truth.
The templar is an archetype of the white mage class.
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Templars are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (light, medium, and heavy) and shields (except tower shields).
Diminished Spellcasting: A templar gains fewer MP than normal equal to the spell level she gains. For example, a white mage of 5th level would only have 4 MP excluding extra MP from Wisdom bonus.
Martial Prowess: A templar's base attack bonus increases by one step (from 1/2 BAB to 3/4 BAB).
This replaces all of the White Magery abilities.
Bonus Feat: A templar gains a bonus feat at 1st level, then again at 5th level and every five levels thereafter (to a maximum of six at 20th level). These bonus feats must be chosen from the following list: Heavy Armor Proficiency, Improved Shield Bash, Martial Weapon Proficiency, Saving Shield, Shield Focus, Tower Shield Proficiency, and Weapon Focus.
# 344 of 907
At 10th level, a templar may also choose from the following feats: Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Greater Shield Focus, Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Critical, Shield Slam, Shield Specialization, and Weapon Specialization.
At 20th level, a templar may also choose from the following feats: Greater Shield Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization. A templar need not meet the normal class- or level-based prerequisites for these bonus feats.
This replaces Mage Talents and Advanced Mage Talents.
Legion's Blessing (Su): At 10th level, a templar gains the ability to confer beneficial spells quickly to a large group of allies. As a full-round action, the templar may confer the effects of a single harmless spell with a range of touch to a number of creatures equal to half her white mage level. The spell's range remains touch, so all intended recipients must be within the templar's reach when the spell is cast. Using the legion's blessing expends the MP of the spell, but it also requires the templar to spend 3 additional MP.
This replaces the Doublecast ability.
