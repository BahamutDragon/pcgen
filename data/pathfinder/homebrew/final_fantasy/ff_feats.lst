If you use shadow burst in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).

BENEFIT:When you use holy burst to heal living creatures, you grant each creature you heal the ability to roll twice and take the better result on a single attack roll, skill check, or saving throw of their choice within a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).

BENEFIT:Once per day when raging, if you are hit by an attack that would deal enough hit points of damage to kill you (negative hit points equal to your Constitution score), as an immediate action you may expend 1 or more rounds of rage to negate some of this damage and keep yourself alive. Each round of rage you spend reduces the attack's damage by 1 point, but cannot reduce the damage taken below 1 hit point. Note: If this damage still makes you fall unconscious, your rage ends just like it normally would, lowering your Constitution to its normal value and reducing your hit point total as normal. Therefore, it is possible to use this feat to prevent yourself from instantly dying, yet you still die because your negative hit points exceed your normal Constitution score-take your normal Constitution into account when deciding how many rounds of rage to spend with this feat.
Flaring Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.365	DESC:You dazzle creatures when you affect them with a spell that has the fire, light, or lightning descriptor.

That creature's saving throw DC to resist the spell is increased by +2. You must choose which target to focus the spell on before casting the spell. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat. MP Increase: +1 (a focused spell costs 1 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)

The ally must cause at least 5 points of damage to you with an attack, spell, or other ability. You then reroll your saving throw, with a +1 bonus for every 5 additional points of damage the attack caused. If your save is successful, the mind-affecting effect ends. Only damage actually dealt counts for purposes of this feat; nonlethal damage and damage reduced or eliminated by damage reduction, resistances, and so on does not qualify.
Forceful Burst	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Burst	SOURCEPAGE:p.365	DESC:Calling on the destructive aspect of magic, you channel pure force.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Shadow burst 7d6.	BENEFIT:Once per day when you use shadow burst to deal damage to living creatures, you can cause affected creatures to make Fortitude saves instead of Will saves.

This penalty stacks with the one from Elemental Penetration. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new element to which you already have applied the Elemental Penetration feat.
Grudge Fighter	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Seeq	SOURCEPAGE:p.366	DESC:You feel great anger at anyone who dares to attack you, and this fury makes your own attacks that much stronger.

BENEFIT:A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level).

BENEFIT:An intensified spell increases the maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels. You must actually have sufficient caster levels to surpass the maximum in order to benefit from this feat.

Lingering Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.368	DESC:You spell clings to existence, slowly fading from the world.	BENEFIT:You may cause an instantaneous spell that affects an area to persist until the beginning of your next turn. Those already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects.

At 15th level, you can increase your effective spell-caster level by three, but you take 5d8 points of non-elemental damage. The effective increase in spell-caster level increases the number of MP you can expend, as well as increasing all spell-caster level-dependent effects, such as range, duration, and overcoming spell resistance.

BENEFIT:Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat. MP Increase: +2 (a persistent spell costs 2 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)

MP Increase: +6 (a prolonged spell costs 6 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
Quicken Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.371	DESC:You can cast spells in a fraction of the normal time.	BENEFIT:Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. MP Increase: +4 (a quickened spell costs 4 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)

MP Increase: Special. A reach spell costs 1 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long costs 3 additional MP.
Rending Claws	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bangaa	SOURCEPAGE:p.372	DESC:Your claws tear and rip through flesh and steel.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6, claws racial trait, bangaa.	BENEFIT:If you hit with two claw attacks in 1 round, the attack deals additional damage equal to 1d3 + your 1-1/2 Str modifier.
Resilient Brute	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Galka	SOURCEPAGE:p.372	DESC:You absorb punishment others find deadly.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Galka.	BENEFIT:Once per day, when a creature confirms a critical hit against you, you may treat half the damage as nonlethal damage. You cannot use this ability if you are immune to nonlethal damage.

Resolute Rager	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Seeq	SOURCEPAGE:p.372	DESC:Fear passes quickly while you are raging.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Seeq, bestial rage class feature.	BENEFIT:While raging, when under the effect of a fear effect that allows a saving throw, you can make a new saving throw against that fear effect at the start of each of your turns before acting. If you make the new save, the fear effect ends.
Reverse-Feint	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Galka	SOURCEPAGE:p.372	DESC:You can goad an opponent into attacking you in order to make your counter attack all the more powerful.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Toughness, base attack bonus +1, galka.	BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can leave a gap in your defenses for one adjacent opponent to use.

Rime Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.372	DESC:Creatures damaged by your spells with the ice descriptor become entangled.	BENEFIT:The frost of your ice spell clings to the target, impeding it for a short time. A rime spell causes creatures that takes ice damage from the spell to become entangled for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. This feat only affects spells with the ice descriptor. MP Increase: +1 (a rime spell costs 1 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
Risky Striker	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Moogle	SOURCEPAGE:p.372	DESC:You can make yourself a little more vulnerable to larger creatures in order to land a devastating blow.

Rondeau of Bastok	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.373	DESC:Your carefully structured song imposes rigid order on your listeners.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (sing) 4 ranks.	BENEFIT:This song follows a set repetition of verses and refrains with a pattern of syllables that remains constant from line to line. As you sing, listeners find their actions bound by your song's relentless order. One enemy per bard level within listening range must make a successful Will save or find its movements hampered. A creature that fails its save can move only in a straight line each turn. The creature can choose which direction it wishes to move each turn, but it can move only along a straight line in that direction, and cannot move around corners or otherwise deviate from this line until its next turn. This effect lasts as long as you maintain the performance. Although this song has words, it is not language-dependent. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round. Action: 1 round.

BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks. You may determine the most valuable item in a hoard as a standard action and gain an additional +2 bonus on the Appraise check to do so.

Normal: Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard takes 1 full-round action.
Selective Burst	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Burst	SOURCEPAGE:p.373	DESC:You can choose whom to affect when you use holy or shadow burst.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Cha 13, holy or shadow burst class feature.	BENEFIT:When you use holy or shadow burst, you can choose a number of targets in the area up to your Charisma modifier. These targets are not affected by your holy or shadow burst.

Selective Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.373	DESC:Your allies need not fear friendly fire.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Spellcraft 10 ranks.	BENEFIT:When casting a selective spell with an area effect and a duration of instantaneous, you can choose a number of targets in the area equal to the ability score modifier used to determine bonus spells of the same type (Charisma for bards, dark knights, holy knights, illusionists, necromancers, red mages, and summoners; Intelligence for black mages and blue mages; Wisdom for geomancers and white mages). These targets are excluded from the effects of your spell. Spells that do not have an area of effect or a duration of instantaneous do not benefit from this feat. MP Increase: +1 (a selective spell costs 1 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
Servitor's Diplomacy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Nu Mou	SOURCEPAGE:p.374	DESC:Years of servitude have made you better at dealing with people and good at either reading them or lying to them.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Nu Mou.	BENEFIT:You get a +2 racial bonus on all Diplomacy checks. For this feat, choose either the Sense Motive skill or the Bluff skill. This choice is permanent.

Sharpclaw	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Burmecian	SOURCEPAGE:p.374	DESC:Your nails are large and strong.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Burmecian.	BENEFIT:You gain two claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage.

Sickening Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.374	DESC:You can sicken creatures with your spells.	BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the sickening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become sickened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added on to the duration of the spell. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat. MP Increase: +2 (a sickening spell costs 2 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
Silent Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.374	DESC:You can cast your spells without making any sound.	BENEFIT:A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components. Spells without verbal components are not affected. MP Increase: +1 (a silent spell costs 1 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
Siphon Burst	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Burst	SOURCEPAGE:p.375	DESC:You can use shadow burst to feed off the suffering of others.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Shadow burst 3d6.	BENEFIT:Once per day when you use shadow burst to damage living creatures, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the die result of your shadow burst + 1 per creature affected by the shadow burst. For each affected creature that did not succeed at its saving throw against the shadow burst, you gain an additional temporary hit point. These temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour.
Skilled Flyer	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Gria.Moogle	SOURCEPAGE:p.375	DESC:Your ability to fly gracefully is better than normal.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Character Level 5th, Gria or Moogle.

Spirit of the Wild	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Viera	SOURCEPAGE:p.375	DESC:Your mystic connection with one type of wilderness has grown even stronger.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Attuned to the Wild, Guardian of the Wild, viera.	BENEFIT:When you are in a terrain type you have selected the Attuned to the Wild feat for, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks made to act in the surprise round of combat. If you act in the surprise round, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet during the surprise round. If you are in an area that qualifies as more than one kind of terrain, these bonuses do not stack; you receive the bonus for only one terrain type.
Spotter	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Teamwork.Varg	SOURCEPAGE:p.375	DESC:Your ally helps you make subtle corrections to your targeting with distance weapons.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Varg.	BENEFIT:When you stand adjacent to an ally with this feat, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your ranged attacks. You also benefit from Point-Blank Shot, Far Shot, or Precise Shot, if your ally has the applicable feat.
Stabbing Shot	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Viera	SOURCEPAGE:p.375	DESC:You can clear the way to continue using your bow.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Rapid Shot, viera.	BENEFIT:When adjacent to an opponent and making a full-attack action with a great bow, longbow or shortbow (including composite bows), you may choose to make a melee attack against that opponent with a drawn arrow rather than firing it. If the attack hits-whether or not it does damage-your target is pushed back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow normally, at the original target, or at another target within range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from Rapid Shot, and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee attack and the ranged attacks) take a -2 penalty. If your initial attack leaves you with no enemies threatening you, you can make the subsequent ranged attack or attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.
Steal MP	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat	SOURCEPAGE:p.376	DESC:You siphon off your opponent's MP.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Sneak attack, must have a MP pool.	BENEFIT:If you hit an opponent with a successful sneak attack, you can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead steal 1d4 MP from your target. For each die of sneak attack damage you forgo, the more die you steal from your opponent's MP.
Steelskin Burst	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Burst	SOURCEPAGE:p.376	DESC:Your holy burst heals the body and hardens the skin.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Holy burst 7d6.	BENEFIT:Once per day when you use holy burst to heal living creatures, you can grant healed creatures damage reduction. Affected creatures gain DR/- equal to the number of holy burst die for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1 minute).
Still Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.376	DESC:You can cast spells without moving.	BENEFIT:A stilled spell can be cast with no somatic components. Spells without somatic components are not affected.	BENEFIT:&nl;MP Increase: +1 (a still spell costs 1 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
Stoic Pose	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tarutaru	SOURCEPAGE:p.376	DESC:You can hold yourself as still as a statue, evading detection.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Tarutaru.	BENEFIT:By spending 5 rounds finding a suitable location, you can hold yourself so still that you appear to be a Small object such as a pile of rocks. This allows you to make a Stealth check without cover or concealment, as long as you do not move or take any other actions.
Stretched Wings	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Aegyl	SOURCEPAGE:p.376	DESC:You strengthen your crippled wings.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 13, Skill Focus (Fly), aegyl, wing-clipped racial trait.	BENEFIT:Your aegyl racial fly speed increases to 60 feet (average). You ignore the wing-clipped trait's Fly check requirement to fly upward.
Summon Weapon	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.376	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: MP Pool	BENEFIT:The character may scribe a rune on a weapon. As long as that weapon is unattended, the character can spend 1 MP to call the weapon to his hand as a swift action. The character can prepare as many weapons as he wants, but cannot use this feat if his hands are full. The weapon must be within line of sight.
Sun Loving	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Mandragora	SOURCEPAGE:p.376	DESC:You can use photosynthesis more often.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Mandragora, Character level 5.	BENEFIT:You can use photosynthesis one additional time per day. Special: You can take this feat more than once.
Surprise Follow-Through	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Galka	SOURCEPAGE:p.377	DESC:When striking one opponent, you catch its ally off guard.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, base attack bonus +1, galka.	BENEFIT:When using Cleave or Great Cleave, the second foe you attack on your turn is denied its Dexterity bonus against you.
Surprise Strike	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Moogle	SOURCEPAGE:p.377	DESC:You actually seem to do more damage when frantically trying to avoid your enemies.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Cautious Fighter, Desperate Swing, base attack bonus +6, moogle.	BENEFIT:Once per day, when fighting defensively or making an attack of opportunity while taking the total defense action with the Desperate Swing feat, you take no penalty on the attack roll.
Tail Terror	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Bangaa	SOURCEPAGE:p.377	DESC:You have strengthened your tail enough to make slap attacks with it.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1, prehensile tail racial trait, bangaa.	BENEFIT:You can make a tail slap attack with your tail. This is a secondary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage.
Tangle Feet	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Mandragora.Moogle.Tarutaru	SOURCEPAGE:p.377	DESC:Creatures who cross your path find themselves tripping over their own feet.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dodge, Mobility, Underfoot, Mandragora, Moogle or Tarutaru, Small size or smaller.	BENEFIT:When you successfully make an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from a larger opponent when you move through its threatened area or its space, you can make that opponent lose its balance until the end of its next turn as a free action. While that creature's balance is lost, if it attempts to move, it must make a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall prone, wasting the move action. You can only affect one creature with this effect each round.
Taste of Blood	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat, Varg	SOURCEPAGE:p.377	DESC:The taste of blood bolsters your bite attack on the following round.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Bone-Crushing Jaws, base attack bonus +6, varg.	BENEFIT:When you score a hit with your bite attack, you gain a +2 racial bonus to your attack roll for bite attacks during the next round.
Tenacious Survivor	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Galka	SOURCEPAGE:p.377	DESC:Your spirit lingers long after any other's would have passed on.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Con 13, Diehard, Endurance, galka.	BENEFIT:When you are killed by hit point damage, your soul lingers in your body for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus. You are still dead, but a creature can make a DC 10 Heal check as a standard action to realize that you can still be saved. You can be healed by magic as if you were alive. If you are healed enough hit points that you would no longer be dead, you are alive again, but you gain one permanent negative level.
The Cockatrice Gambit	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.377	DESC:Your antics can soften even the hardest visage.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (comedy) or Perform (oratory) 7 ranks.	BENEFIT:You tell an old and humorous tale about a woman who refused to smile at anything, no matter how funny. Through a series of increasingly unlikely events involving a cart of horse manure, a king, and a flying carpet, her legendary frown broke at last. When you complete the performance, the target cured of Petrify status. Use: 2 bardic performance rounds. Action: 1 minute.
The Dance of the Moogle	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.378	DESC:This complex dance makes you difficult to strike.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (dance) 4 ranks.	BENEFIT:The shuffling steps, bends, and leaps of this intricate dance make you a difficult target to hit, but also make it more difficult for you to perform other actions. When using this feat, you take a -2 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you must make a concentration check to perform any song (DC 15 + the song's level), but you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When you have 8 ranks in Perform (dance), and every 4 ranks thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You can combine this feat with fighting defensively and Combat Expertise, but not total defense. When you use this feat, it lasts until the start of your next turn. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance) affect this feat; this allows you to get multiple rounds of its benefit (and its penalties) at the cost of only 1 round of bardic performance. Use: 1 bardic performance round. Action: 1 free action.
The Foolish Galka	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.378	DESC:Your acting conjures hellfire and salt to destroy plants.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (act) or Perform (comedy) 6 ranks.	BENEFIT:This pantomime tells the tale of a foolish galka farmer who failed to control the weeds that grew so quickly upon his land. In desperation, the farmer bargained with a devil, who blasted the earth with salt and withering heat, leaving the fertile land desolate for a century. When you complete the performance, you can create a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line that is blasted with scorching air and hot salt. Plants and oozes in this area take 1d6 points of damage per bard level (maximum 10d6); half this damage is fire damage, half is piercing damage. A Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Creatures other than plants or oozes take half damage, or no damage on a successful save. Use: 2 bardic performance rounds. Action: 1 full round.
The Kefka Refrain	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.378	DESC:Your strange melody of hacking gasps and pained wheezes draws upon the dark powers of Kefka to fill a witness with debilitating and distracting phlegm.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (sing) 5 ranks.	BENEFIT:Your song emulates the sounds of a terrible illness, causing one creature you are aware of who can hear your song to develop a psychosomatic flu. If the target fails its Will save, whenever it attempts any action other than moving up to its base speed or making a single melee attack (but not both) in a single round, it must succeed at a concentration check (DC 10 + your Charisma modifier) to avoid wasting its action because of a fit of coughing and sneezing. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round. Action: 1 standard action.
The Mithra Cat-Step	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.378	DESC:Your agile dancing allows you and others to fall safely and land gracefully.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (dance) 5 ranks.	BENEFIT:This quick dance is a series of small steps culminating in a series of leaps. When you complete the performance, for the next 10 minutes you treat any distance fallen as if it were a number of feet shorter equal to half your bard level x 5. You may spend the first minute of this effect demonstrating the dance to up to one creature per two bard levels; if these students succeed at a DC 15 Perform (dance) check, they also gain the benefits of this feat for the remainder of its duration. Use: 4 bardic performance rounds. Action: 4 full rounds.
The Requiem of the Fallen Mage-King	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.379	DESC:Your performance reveals ways to cheat time itself.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (oratory) 10 ranks or Perform (sing) 10 ranks.	BENEFIT:This piece tells the story of a mighty mage-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next 10 minutes. When you perform this feat, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to perform a nonmagical action that normally requires a move action or a standard action. For example, you could make a full attack, then spend a swift action to take a normal move, load a light crossbow, or draw a weapon in the same round. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the feat; otherwise the benefit is lost. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase your speed (such as haste). Your allies may benefit from this feat, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance, and you must expend 1 round of bardic performance for each ally other than yourself whom you want to gain the ability to accelerate time (for example, affecting yourself and five others requires expending 11 rounds of bardic performance). This is a language-dependent effect. Use: 5 bardic performance rounds, +1 round per additional person affected. Action: 1 minute.
Threatening Illusion	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.379	DESC:You've mastered the art of making illusions that force foes to divide their attention in combat.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Spell Focus (illusion).	BENEFIT:You can use this metamagic feat only on illusion spells. A threatening illusion spell causes one target to believe your illusion is a threat. Choose one 5-foot square within the area of your illusion; that square threatens the target as long as it is adjacent. Thus, if you or an ally is on the opposite side of the target, it is considered flanking. Normally the area must contain an illusory creature of Small or Medium size. However, you can select one square of a larger illusory creature to threaten the target. For example, an illusory Large ogre takes up four 5-foot squares; you select one square to be the source of the threat, and its other three squares do not threaten anyone. If the target has reason to believe there is an invisible creature in the vicinity, even an auditory illusion with no visual elements (such as ghost sound) is sufficient to convince the target that the selected square contains an actual threat. As long as you maintain the illusion, you can change the location of the threatening square as a swift action. When you threaten a target with this spell, the foe may make a Will save to disbelieve (DC 10 + threatening spell's level + your spellcasting ability score modifier). If the target makes this save, the threatening effect of this feat no longer applies to it. MP Increase: +1 (a threatening illusion spell costs 1 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.) Normal: Illusion spells do not threaten squares.
Throwdown Trip	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Varg	SOURCEPAGE:p.379	DESC:You have learned how to knock the breath out of an opponent that you trip.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Tripping Bite, (or Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Trip), varg.	BENEFIT:If you successfully trip an opponent, you force your foe to succeed at a Fortitude save (DC equal to CMB result) or become staggered until the end of his next turn.
Thruster Blast	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat	SOURCEPAGE:p.380	DESC:By directing your vectored thrusters all around your magitek, you can kick up a cloud of dust and debris that obscures the battlefield.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Pilot 10 ranks, magitek flight system (either jetpack, thruster boots, or magicite thruster boots).	BENEFIT:You can aim your thruster exhaust toward the ground to create a hemispherical cloud. If you are within 30 feet of the ground and there is loose debris or dust, you can create a cloud with a 50-foot radius centered directly below you. The generated winds snuff out small fires and give guided missiles attacking you a -4 penalty on their attack rolls. Creatures without eye protection caught within the debris cloud are blinded while inside it and for 1 round after emerging from it. The debris cloud grants anyone inside it one-half concealment (20%% miss chance). Magitek with sensor systems ignore the concealment effects. Because some magitek have vectored thrust systems, their flight path isn't affected by the aim of the exhaust. They don't have to hover or fly upward to create the cloud.
Thundering Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.380	DESC:You can conjure your spells into existence with blaring thunder or fearful shrieks, deafening creatures damaged by their effects.	BENEFIT:You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, it becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat. MP Increase: +2 (a thundering spell costs 2 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
Tonberry's Grudge	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Performance	SOURCEPAGE:p.380	DESC:The horror of the Tonberry shrieks through your instrument to make a listener experience the death she dreads most.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (string) 7 ranks.	BENEFIT:You produce a sound that causes creatures to believe they are suffering a particularly ghastly and terrifying death, such as immolation, freezing to death, or being eaten alive by insects. When you complete this performance, all creatures within 30 feet who can hear your performance must make a successful Will saving throw or take 1d6 points of elemental damage. The elemental type can be either earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind (your choice, chosen when you begin performing the feat). Affected creatures that fail their saving throws take damage on the round you begin the performance and each round you continue the performance as long as they remain in range. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance affect this feat. Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.
Tongue Lash	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Qu	SOURCEPAGE:p.380	DESC:You can use your tongue as a whip.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agile Tongue, Fantastic Tongue, Grasping Tongue, qu	BENEFIT:You may use your tongue as a whip, either as a primary or a secondary attack. You are considered proficient with this attack.
Trailblazing Burst	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Burst	SOURCEPAGE:p.380	DESC:Your holy burst makes trailblazers of those you heal.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Holy burst 3d6.	BENEFIT:Once per day when you use holy burst, you can cause healed creatures to be unimpeded by difficult terrain for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 minute).
Trap Wrecker	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Galka	SOURCEPAGE:p.381	DESC:You can smash traps instead of disarming them.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Power Attack, Disable Device 1 rank, galka.	BENEFIT:You can attempt to disarm a trap by striking it with a melee weapon instead of making a Disable Device check. As a full-round action, make a melee attack against an Armor Class equal to the trap's Disable Device DC. If you miss, the trap activates. If you hit, roll damage. If this damage is at least half the trap's Disable Device DC, you disable the trap. If this damage is less than half the trap's Disable Device DC, the trap activates. You can only attempt this on non-magical traps. You must be able to reach some part of the trap with your attack in order to use this feat. At the GM's discretion, some traps may not be susceptible to this feat.
Tripping Bite	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Combat.Varg	SOURCEPAGE:p.381	DESC:You have tapped into your wolf heritage and learned how to trip a foe that you successfully bite.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Varg.	BENEFIT:You gain the trip special attack, which allows you to trip an opponent as a free action, without provoking an attack of opportunity, when you hit with your bite attack. Your opponent may not attempt to trip you in return. You also gain a +2 bonus to CMB roll when making a trip attempt after biting your foe. Normal: You can only attempt a trip attempt in place of a melee attack, and it provokes an attack of opportunity from your target.
Umbral Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.381	DESC:Targets of your darkness spells radiate darkness.	BENEFIT:An umbral spell gains the darkness descriptor. As long as the spell is in effect, the creature or object affected radiates darkness in a 10-foot radius, reducing illumination similar to the effects of the darkness spell. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light level in this area. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected by an umbral spell if they are of a higher level than the umbral spell's unmodified spell level. This effect does not stack with itself or with any other effect that creates darkness. You cannot use this feat on a spell with an instantaneous duration or a spell that does not target a creature or object. MP Increase: +2 (an umbral spell costs 2 additional MP more than the actual MP cost of the spell.)
