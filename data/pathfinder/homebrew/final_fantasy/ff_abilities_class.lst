# Class Features

###Block - Archer Class Feature
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Archer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:Archers are proficient with all simple weapons, plus longbow, shortbow, composite longbow, composite shortbow, and greatbow. Archers are proficient with light armor, but not with any type of shields.
Limit Breaks			KEY:Archer ~ Limit Breaks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At 1st level, the archer receives the Limit Breaks (Hail of Arrows and Trueshot Arrow).
Hail of Arrows			KEY:Archer ~ Hail of Arrows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:This Limit Break allows the archer to shoot a single arrow into the area within 60 feet. As the arrow descends, it splits into hundreds of arrows raining down upon his enemies. Enemies within a 20-ft.-radius of the indicated area the archer has chosen suffer 1d6 damage per archer level, a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 archer level + Dexterity modifier) for half damage.
Trueshot Arrow			KEY:Archer ~ Trueshot Arrow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:This Limit Break allows the archer to fire an arrow at any opponent at three times the maximum range without any penalties for the round. The archer receives a +1 competence bonus on the Attack roll per archer level. If the attack hits, the damage is maximized.
Archery				KEY:Archer ~ Archery				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At 1st level, the archer is treated as having the Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Aim					KEY:Archer ~ Aim					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:Starting at 1st level, as part of an attack action, the archer can wait a few seconds to aim and take a full measure of his bow to make every shot count. For every segment on the initiative the archer waits (up to the max of his Aim bonus), the archer receives a competence bonus equal to his Aim bonus for Attack and Damage rolls. If something interrupts the archer's Aim, the archer must make a Reflex save (DC 15 + the amount of Aim bonus) or lose the action. (For example, an archer uses Aim +5, and he rolls a 16 for Initiative. His attack doesn't go off until 11, but during that time between 16 and 11, if something interrupts the archer, he has to make a Reflex save (DC 20) to not lose his attack.) Anything causing the archer to drop his bow disrupts his attack. Feats that grant extra attacks cannot be used in conjunction with the Aim ability. The aim ability does not change your initiative on subsequent rounds (unlike delayed/readied actions which change your initiative count).
Hawkeye				KEY:Archer ~ Hawkeye				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 2nd level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks, and the range increment for any bow he uses increases by 5 feet. These bonuses increase by +1 and 5 additional feet for every 3 levels beyond 2nd.
Precision Shot			KEY:Archer ~ Precision Shot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, the archer adds the indicated damage bonus to any shot he makes against a foe who is denied Dexterity to AC (whether the target already has a Dexterity bonus or not). This extra damage is 1d6 at 2nd level, and it only applies when the archer uses a bow while within 30 feet of the target. The extra damage increases by 1d6 every four archer levels thereafter. At 16th level, when the archer gains the ability to flank with the bow, this damage also applies to shots against flanked targets. The archer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. An archer cannot make a precision shot while striking a creature with concealment.
Evasion				KEY:Archer ~ Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 3rd level and higher, an archer can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the archer is wearing light armor. A helpless archer does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Deadshot				KEY:Archer ~ Deadshot				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 3rd level, when an archer attacks with a bow as a readied action, he may add his Dexterity bonus (minimum +1) on his damage roll.
High Ground				KEY:Archer ~ High Ground			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:After 4th level, if the adventuring archer is at least 5 vertical feet above their target, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all attack rolls made against them. The effective range of the archer's special abilities (such as Precision Shot and Point Blank Shot) is doubled. The effects of this ability cannot increase the range of the archer's attacks beyond the archer's maximum range.
Expert Archer			KEY:Archer ~ Expert Archer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 4th level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with bows. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 4th.
Improved Archery			KEY:Archer ~ Improved Archery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 5th level, an archer's aptitude in his archery improves. He is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Hunter's Tricks			KEY:Archer ~ Hunter's Tricks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 5th level, an archer learns the use of hunter's tricks, which typically grant a boon or bonus to the archer or a nearby ally. At 5th level, the archer learns one trick, selected from the list below. At 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, he learns another trick. An archer can use these tricks a total number of times per day equal to 1/2 his archer level + his Wisdom modifier. Tricks are usually swift actions, but sometimes move or free actions that modify a standard action, usually an attack action. Once a trick is chosen, it can't be retrained. An archer cannot select an individual trick more than once. The following is a list of hunter tricks and their effects.
Fast Movement			KEY:Archer ~ Fast Movement			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:At 6th level, when not firing or reloading, archer can quickly change position. When wearing light armor and carrying no more than a light load, his base move speed increases by 10'. This bonus increases to 20' at 12th level and again increases again to 30' at 18th level.
Trick Shot				KEY:Archer ~ Trick Shot				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:At 6th level, an archer can choose one of the following actions: disarm, feint, or sunder. He can perform this action with a bow against any target within 30 feet, with a -4 penalty to his attack roll. Every four levels beyond 6th, he may choose an additional trick shot to learn. These maneuvers use up arrows as normal. At 14th level, he may also choose from the following actions: bull rush, grapple, trip. A target grappled by an arrow can break free by destroying the archer's arrow (hardness 5, hit points 1, break DC 13) or with an Escape Artist or Strength check (against the archer's -4 penalty).
Improved Deadshot			KEY:Archer ~ Improved Deadshot		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:At 7th level, when an archer attacks with a bow as a readied action, his target is denied its Dexterity bonus to its AC.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Archer ~ Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Starting at 8th level, an archer can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. An archer with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him. If an archer already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Safe Shot				KEY:Archer ~ Safe Shot				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Beginning at 9th level, the archer no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when making a ranged attack with his bow. When making other ranged attacks, such as throwing a dagger, the archer provokes as normal.
Archery Mastery			KEY:Archer ~ Archery Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:At 10th level, an archer's aptitude in his archery improves again. He is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of this ability apply only when he wears light armor. He loses all benefits of this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Ranged Cleave			KEY:Archer ~ Ranged Cleave			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A bow in the hands of an 11th-level archer becomes a weapon capable of shots with incredible power and precision. Whenever an archer deals enough damage to a creature with a bow to drop the creature below 0 hit points, the archer receives a second attack against another creature within half the weapon's range increment of the first target. If the second target is dropped below 0 hit points by the attack, the archer may take a third attack against another creature within one-quarter of the weapon's range increment from the second target, and so on - the maximum distance between potential targets halving each time a target is successfully dropped.
Improved Evasion			KEY:Archer ~ Improved Evasion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 11th level, the archer's evasion ability improves. This works like evasion, except that while the archer still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless archer does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
Take Aim				KEY:Archer ~ Take Aim				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 12th level, an archer may spend a full round to aim at a target. If the target remains stationary (moves no more than 5 feet), he may add half his class level to all ranged attacks he makes against that target within the next round.
Evasive Archer			KEY:Archer ~ Evasive Archer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 13th level, an archer gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 17th level.
Critical Aim			KEY:Archer ~ Critical Aim			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 14th level, the archer's aim becomes a precise deadliness. The critical threat range of all bows in the hands of the archer is increased by 1. At 18th level, this increases by 1 again. This increase stacks with Improved Critical and Keen effects.
Penetrating Shot			KEY:Archer ~ Penetrating Shot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 15th level, when an archer confirms a critical hit with a bow, the arrow pierces the target and can strike another creature in line behind it. The archer must be able to trace a line starting at his space and passing through both targets to make this additional attack. The secondary attack is made at a -4 penalty, in addition to any modifiers for added range. If this attack is also a critical hit, the arrow can continue to hit another target, but the penalties stack.
Threatening Shot			KEY:Archer ~ Threatening Shot			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Beginning at 16th level, the archer is so deadly with his bow, he may flank targets. He threatens an area at 10 ft. away, but not adjacent.
Volley				KEY:Archer ~ Volley				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 17th level, as a full-round action, an archer can make a single bow attack at his highest base attack bonus against any number of creatures in a 15-foot-radius burst, making separate attack and damage rolls for each creature.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Archer ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:An archer of 18th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies an enemy the ability to gain a bonus on attack rolls by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more character levels than the archer does.
Ranged Defense			KEY:Archer ~ Ranged Defense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 19th level, an archer gains DR 5/- against ranged attacks. In addition, as an immediate action, he can catch an arrow fired at him and shoot it any target he chooses. The archer must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this ability.
Master Archer			KEY:Archer ~ Master Archer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 20th level, an archer's skill with archery becomes legendary. Any attacks made with that any bow the archer wields automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (x2 becomes x3, for example). In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding any bow.

# Hunter's Tricks
Aiding Attack			KEY:Hunter's Trick ~ Aiding Attack		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter's Trick.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:The archer can use this trick as a free action when he hits a creature with an attack. The next ally who makes an attack against the target creature before the start of the archer's next turn gains a +2 circumstance bonus on that attack roll.
Archer's Counsel			KEY:Hunter's Trick ~ Archer's Counsel	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter's Trick.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:As a swift action, the archer can grant all allies within 30 feet that are within line of sight and can hear him a +2 bonus on skill checks with a single skill of his choice. The archer must have at least one rank in the chosen skill. This bonus lasts for 1 round.
Catfall				KEY:Hunter's Trick ~ Catfall			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter's Trick.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:The archer can use this trick as an immediate action when he falls 20 or more feet, ignoring the first 20 feet of the fall when calculating the falling damage.

Spells				KEY:Red Mage ~ Spells					SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature05a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.171	DESC:A red mage casts red magic spells which are drawn from the red mage spell list. A red mage begins play with 2 1st level red mage spells of his choice. At each new red mage level, he gains one new spell of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new red mage level). Like most mages, a red mage can find or purchase scrolls with spells to add to his repertoire. To learn or cast a red mage spell, the red mage must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a red mage's spell is 10 + the spell level + the red mage's Charisma modifier.

Ruby Knowledge			KEY:Red Mage ~ Ruby Knowledge				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature09a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:A red mage is specialized in dealing and healing damage with his spells. Whenever a red mage casts a spell that deals hit point dice damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to the amount of damage dealt. Whenever a red mage casts a spell that heals hit point dice damage, he adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to the damage healed. A single spell can never gain this extra damage or healing more than once per casting. If a spell deals or heals damage for more than 1 round, it does not gain the benefit of the ruby knowledge ability. The bonus from the this ability applies only to spells that he casts as a red mage, not to those he might have by virtue of levels in another class.
Spell Combat			KEY:Red Mage ~ Spell Combat				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature10a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:At 1st level, a red mage learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, the red mage must have one hand free, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a -4 penalty and can also cast any spell from his red mage spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his attack rolls, up to his Charisma bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on his Concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. A red mage can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.
Arcane Pool				KEY:Red Mage ~ Arcane Pool				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature11a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.172	DESC:At 2nd level, the red mage gains a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and enhance his weapon. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 his red mage level (minimum 1) + his Charisma modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when the red mage rests for a full 8 hours. At 2nd level, a red mage can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 2nd the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves. At 6th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the red mage uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the red mage. A red mage can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.

Spellstrike				KEY:Red Mage ~ Spellstrike				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature13a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:At 2nd level, whenever a red mage casts a single-target spell, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a red mage can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the red mage makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.
Armored Mage			KEY:Red Mage ~ Armored Mage				SORTKEY:Red Mage Class Feature14a				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Red Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.173	DESC:At 3rd level, normally, armor heavier than light armor interferes with a spell-caster's gestures, which can cause spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A red mage's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid spell failure so long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium armor or to heavy shields. This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different spell-casting class. At 7th level, a red mage learns to use medium armor with no chance of spell failure. At 10th level, a red mage learns to use heavy shields with no chance of spell failure.
