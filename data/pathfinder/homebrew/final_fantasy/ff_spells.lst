24 Hours	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell greatly accelerates time for a single creature. In an instant, the creature experiences a single day's worth of rest and relaxation. The target receives all the benefits of a single day of rest, including hit point recovery, ability damage repair, etc. As a by-product, the creature ages one full day. Spells and other external forces with a fixed duration do not experience the day but poisons, diseases and other internal forces progress as if a day had passed. If 24 hours was cast on a bleeding individual, for example, this spell would kill them.
Abhorrent Blight	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will partial	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:With necromantic energies you attack the bond between a living soul and its body which also damages its driving force of will. The target creature suffers 1d6 hit points/level (maximum 10d6) and 1 point/2 levels of Charisma damage (maximum 5). Upon a successful save the target suffers only half the hit point damage and negates the Charisma damage.
Accelerate Poison	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You hasten the onset of poison in the target. If the poison normally has an onset time, its effects begin immediately. If the poison has no onset time, its frequency is doubled, requiring two saving throws and inflicting damage twice per round or minute, though its duration is halved. Accelerate poison does not change the cure condition for the poison. If the target is affected by more than one poison, you may choose which is affected if you administered the poison; otherwise, randomly determine which poison is affected.

# 529 of 907
Aero II	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Red Mage=2	DESC:This spell functions like Aero, except it deals 3d6 points of wind damage + your casting modifier (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and inflicts the Squalled status effect for 1d6 rounds. A successful Reflex save prevents the status effect from taking effect.
Aero III	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Red Mage=3	DESC:This spell functions like Aero, except it deals 5d6 points of wind damage + your casting modifier (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) and inflicts the Squalled status effect for 1d8 rounds. A successful Reflex save prevents the status effect from taking effect.

Age Resistance	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=6	DESC:This spell functions as lesser age resistance, except you ignore the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution penalties gained at middle age and old age.
Age Resistance, Greater	KEY:Age Resistance (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=7	DESC:This spell functions as lesser age resistance, except you ignore all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution penalties gained from middle age, old age, and venerable age.
Age Resistance, Lesser	KEY:Age Resistance (Lesser)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours	DESC:You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged. This spell does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the -1 penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you become middle-aged. You retain the age-related bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell. Additional penalties that you accrue upon becoming old or venerable apply in full.

Aging Touch	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Living creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Your touch ages living creatures. Any creature you touch with a successful melee touch attack takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution damage. This aging is reflected in the target's appearance-skin becomes more wrinkled and pockmarked, hair turns white, posture stoops-and while this has no additional negative effect, it does provide a cumulative +2 bonus on Disguise checks. Only the target's body is aged by this spell, and it gains none of the benefits of growing older naturally. Creatures that gain benefits by age category do not gain additional advantages due to this spell. Every time a creature is affected by this spell, it is temporarily aged one age category. Every time the target ages in this way, the effects of this spell stack, until the target reaches venerable age. If a creature is aged past venerable, it instead takes 5d6 points of non-elemental damage each time it is struck, as its body succumbs to the ravages of incredibly swift decay. Ability damage dealt by this spell heals as normal, at a rate of 1 point per day for each affected ability. The bonus on Disguise checks also fades over time, decreasing at a rate of -2 every day until the target's Disguise modifier returns to normal.
Aid	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing	CLASSES:White Mage=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Living creature touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:Aid grants the target a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+10 temporary hit points at caster level 10th).

Air Bubble	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,Red Mage,White Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One creature or one object no larger than a Large two-handed weapon	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:Air bubble creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature's head or the touched object. The air bubble allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage.
Aire Tam Storm	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Non-Elemental	CLASSES:Blue Mage=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:60 ft.	TARGETAREA:Creatures within a 60-ft.-radius burst centered on you	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Creature Learned From (BM only): Emerald Weapon	DESC:The caster emulates the Emerald Weapon's powerful materia blast. This attack deals 5 points of non-elemental damage per material level (5/10/15/20) per materia on or equipped on each person within a 60-ft.-radius.
Air Walk	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Geomancer,White Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature (Gargantuan or smaller) touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to half the air walker's normal speed. A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of a creature's turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the air walk spell is dispelled. You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of air walk (counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with 1 week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

Air Walk, Communal	KEY:Air Walk (Communal)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Geomancer,White Mage=5	TARGETAREA:Creatures touched	DESC:This spell functions like air walk, except divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the creatures touched.
Alleviate	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Healing|Cantrip	CLASSES:Red Mage,White Mage=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:Alleviate ends a sickened condition for the creature touched. The target cannot be affected again by the same thing that initially sickened them for 24 hours.
Alter Fortune	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=3	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:With a single utterance, you create a momentary distortion that engulfs and confounds your foe. You change the flow of chance, causing the subject to immediately reroll any die roll it just made. It must abide by the second roll.
Alter Taste	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion|Cantrip	CLASSES:Illusionist=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:One meal of 1 cu. ft./level	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell changes the taste of one meal to a taste that is pleasant for the creature consuming it. Note that this spell only disguises the taste of the meal and does not alter any other quality of it. While it will alter the taste of rotten meat, for instance, the meat will still be rotten. Furthermore, all parts of the meal taste the same no matter what is eaten. Thus soup, salad, main course, dinner roll and so on will all taste exactly alike since the spell masks any and all flavors with the taste. Each creature that tastes the meal will experience a different taste sensation depending on what his or her preference is. Thus, one creature might taste warm bread while another tastes raw meat. This spell changes the taste of anything that is part of the meal at the time the spell is cast; if something is added later, such as gravy or poison, then the spell cannot alter that and the creature receives the proper taste of the added item. Creatures are instantly aware of this spell's effect upon the first bite and can choose to disbelieve the spell's effects at any time.

Alter Winds	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Geomancer=1	CASTTIME:1 minute	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Immobile 10-ft.-radius emantion	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You subtly enhance or diminish the effects of natural winds within the spell's area, which is an immobile emanation around a point touched by you as the spell is cast. Within the area, natural (but not magical) wind effects are either increased or decreased by one step in intensity. The maximum wind force you can affect with this spell is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. Alter winds has no effect on magical wind effects.	DESC:&nl;Caster Level Wind Force	DESC:&nl;1st-3rd - Light	DESC:&nl;4th-9th - Moderate	DESC:&nl;10th-15th - Strong	DESC:&nl;16th or higher - Severe
Amanuensis	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy|Cantrip	CLASSES:Time Mage=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Object or objects with writing	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	DESC:You point at the writing and then move your hand as though holding a stylus or quill. As you intone the spell, the script appears on a sheet of paper close at hand. You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied into a book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook, a spell scroll, or a sepia snake sigil). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with explosive runes), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied. The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied. Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages. The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy.

Annihilate	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire/Enfeebling	CLASSES:Blue Mage=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:100 ft.	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius spread	DURATION:Instantaneous; (CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Creature Learned From (BM only): King Bomb	DESC:&nl;The caster emulates the powerful nuke ability of a king bomb. Creatures within the area of effect take 15d8 points of fire damage and are inflicted with the Burning status for 1 round per level. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates the status effect.
Anticipate Peril	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes or until activated	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A creature affected by anticipate peril gains a preternatural sense of danger. The first time during this spell's duration that the target has to make an initiative check, the creature adds an insight bonus on that initiative check equal to the spell's caster level (maximum +5). Once this bonus applies, the effects of the spell end
Anticipatory Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DESC:The air reverberates with an eager hum as your movements pick up speed. You take your normal action for the round at the time that you cast this spell, rather than waiting for your turn to come up in the initiative sequence. In subsequent rounds, your place in the initiative order does not change-you change the time when you act for this round only. You can take a standard action and a move action, or a full-round action, just as you could if you were taking your action at your normal place in initiative order. You can't cast this spell if you're flatfooted, and you can't cast this spell a second time until after your next turn has passed.

Anti-Life Shell	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Dark	CLASSES:Necromancer=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures. The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead. This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing the barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.
Aqualung	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enfeebling|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Blue Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.	TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst	DURATION:Instantaneous/1d6 rounds	SAVEINFO:Fortitude half; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Creature Learned From (BM only): Bandersnatch	DESC:&nl;The caster can emulate the watery breath weapon of a bandersnatch. Creatures within the area of effect take 8d6 points of water damage and are inflicted with Silence status for 1d6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the status effect.
Aqueous Orb	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Geomancer=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-diameter sphere	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create a rolling sphere of churning water that can engulf those it strikes. The aqueous orb can move up to 30 feet per round, rolling over barriers less than 10 feet tall. It automatically quenches any non-magical fires and functions as dispel magic against magical fires as long as those fires are size Large or less. Any creature in the path of the aqueous orb takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage, but a Large or smaller creature that fails its save must make a second save or be engulfed by the aqueous orb and carried along with it. Engulfed creatures are immersed in water and must hold their breath unless capable of breathing water. They gain cover against attacks from outside the aqueous orb but are considered entangled by its churning currents, takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the beginning of their turn each round they remain trapped. Creatures within the orb may attempt a new Reflex save each round to escape into a random square adjacent to the aqueous orb. The orb may hold one Large creature, 4 Medium, or 16 Small or smaller creatures within it. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and churns in place. An aqueous orb stops if it moves outside the spell's range.

Ardor	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Non-Elemental	CLASSES:Black Mage=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Ray	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A blast of pure magical energy shoots out from the caster's fingertip. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if the ray hits, it deals 1d8 points of non-elemental damage per caster level (maximum 20d8).
Arise	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Healing	CLASSES:Necromancer,White Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 minute	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Dead creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None; see text	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell functions like Raise, except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute per caster level. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be raised, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level. Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of MP. The subject of the spell gains one permanent negative level when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised). You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot raise someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised.

Aura of Terror	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You speak a few curt words and your face is briefly overlaid with the image of a violet-shaded skull. The skull fades, but the nimbus of violet light remains around you. You become surrounded by an aura of fear, granting you a frightful presence not unlike that of a dragon. Whenever you charge or attack, you inspire fear in all creatures within 30 feet that have fewer Hit Dice than your caster level. Each potentially affected opponent must succeed on a Will save or become shaken-a condition that lasts until the opponent is out of range. A successful save leaves that opponent immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. If you cast this spell when you already have the frightful presence ability or a fear aura, the existing ability becomes more effective in the following ways:	DESC:* The radius of the area affected by the ability increases by 10 feet.	DESC:* The DC of your frightful presence ability increases by 2.	DESC:* Creatures that would normally be shaken by your fear aura are frightened instead, and creatures that would normally be frightened are panicked.

SCHOOL:Healing	CLASSES:White Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:The creature touched with this spell is imbued with a Cure III spell. When struck by a physical or magical attack, the healing spell goes off immediately. It only lasts for one use.

Avasculate	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Ray	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You shoot a black ray of necromantic energy from your outstretched hand, causing your foe to violently purge blood or other vital fluids through his skin. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If the attack succeeds, the subject is reduced to half of its current hit points (rounded down) and stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned.
# 539 of 907
Avasculate Mass	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=8	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Ray	DURATION:See text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial and Reflex negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You shoot a black ray of necromantic energy from your outstretched hand, causing your foe to violently purge blood vessels through its skin. The purged blood vessels spread outward, creating a many-layered mass of bloody, adhesive tissue that traps nearby creatures in a gory horror. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If the attack is successful, the subject loses half its hit points (rounded down) and is stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned. Oozes and plants are not affected by this spell. The avascular mass instantaneously erupts from the subject and must be anchored to at least two opposed points-such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls-or else the mass collapses and has no effect. Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius avascular mass become entangled. The original target of the spell is automatically entangled. Because the avascular mass is magically animate and gradually tightens on those it holds, an entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 25 Concentration check or lose the spell. Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the avascular mass and is free to act, though moving might be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. If you have at least 5 feet of avascular mass between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of avascular mass between you, it provides total cover. The avascular mass of entangling tissue persists for 1 round per caster level. When the duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes so much limp, decaying tissue.
Awaiting	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=1	CASTTIME:Special	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round	DESC:This spell twists the caster's perception of time. He may wait and absorb all the actions of others, planning and preparing and then, when he is ready, he may act without any perceivable delay. This spell may be cast as a free action. Under the influence of this spell, the caster receives two benefits. Casting this spell fixes the caster's initiative. In the following round, the character acts on whatever initiative this spell was cast, immaterial of any actions on his part that would normally change his initiative. Additionally, the caster may delay his actions in a round for as long as he wishes and never forfeit those actions. This spell gives the caster time to prepare and plan. He may observe all the actions of his opponent before acting and he has time to consider what to do if he waits until everyone else has acted. This spell does not mean the GM must stop the game while the player plans but he should give the player a few minutes if he is willing to let everyone else act first.

Backbiter	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One weapon	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	DESC:The weapon you indicate during the spell's casting briefly shimmers with a black aura that disappears in an eyeblink. You cast this spell on any melee weapon. The next time that weapon is used to make a melee attack, its shaft twists around so that the weapon strikes the wielder instead. The weapon hits automatically, and no attack roll is made. The wielder gets no warning or knowledge of the spell's effect on his weapon, and although he makes the attack, the self-dealt damage can't be consciously reduced (though damage reduction applies) or changed to nonlethal damage. Once the weapon attacks its wielder (whether successfully or not), the spell is discharged. Magic weapons targeted by this spell receive a Will save. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its wielder's bonus, whichever is higher.

Baleful Blink	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You cause the creature to wink in and out of time erratically, much to its chagrin. You curse one creature to a frustrating existence on the outskirts of time. The subject shimmers in and out of time and has a 50%% miss chance on any melee or ranged attacks (as if the target of the attack had total concealment). Because the magic of the spell only causes the subject to blink when attacking or casting, attackers have no miss chance against her, and spells cast against her affect her normally. Because the blinking is so rapid, she cannot attempt to blink through walls. The subject of a baleful blink spell can cast spells on itself with impunity; in this case, it has no miss chance because the target of its spell (itself) travels along with the spell.
Ball Lightning	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Lightning	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's course. If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of lightning damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a -4 penalty on this Saving Throw. Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A ball lightning globe winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

Battering Blast	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature or unattended object	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You hurl a fist-sized ball of wind resembling a sphere of spikes to ram a designated creature or object. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. On a successful hit, you deal 1d6 points of wind damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). For every 5 caster levels you possess beyond 5th, you gain a second ball of wind. A creature struck by any of these is subject to a bull rush attempt. The wind has a Strength modifier equal to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). The Attack roll for the wind's bull rush uses your caster level as its base attack bonus, adding the wind's Strength modifier and a +10 bonus for each additional blast directed against the same target. Each sphere of wind makes its own separate bull rush attempt-if multiple spheres strike one target, you make multiple Attack rolls but only take the highest result to determine success. If the bull rush succeeds, the wind pushes the creature away from you in a straight line, and the creature must make a Reflex save or fall prone. This spell pushes an unattended object struck by it 20 feet away from you, provided it weighs no more than 25 pounds per level (maximum 250 pounds). This spell cannot move creatures or objects beyond your range. Used on a door or other obstacle, the spell attempts a Strength check to destroy it if the sheer damage inflicted by the spell doesn't do the job.

You must make a DC 20 concentration check to cast spells, and all other concentration checks to cast spells have a -5 penalty.

Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is Spell Resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and Spell Resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

Furthermore, for each 5 feet a creature moves through such areas, it takes 1d6 points of earth damage. Creatures with a burrow speed or the earth glide ability are unaffected by binding earth.

The blackfire crackles and hisses, emanating the smells of hot metal and sulfur. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. On a successful attack, a living target is engulfed in chill black flames that feed on the fuel of their victim's life force. A creature engulfed in blackfire must make a successful Fortitude save each round that the spell is in effect or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated. A creature that makes its Fortitude save takes no damage for that round and is sickened instead. In addition to its effects on the subject, blackfire can spread rapidly. Each round on its turn, any living creature adjacent to a creature engulfed in blackfire must succeed on a Reflex save or become engulfed itself. Any creature that has its Constitution reduced to 0 or lower by the spell is turned into a pile of black ash and can be returned to life only by full-life, the caster of which must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check to restore the victim to life. If a creature succeeds on its Fortitude save in 3 consecutive rounds, the blackfire affecting it gutters out. The black flames cannot otherwise be extinguished by normal means (such as immersion in water or smothering), but a successful dispel snuffs it out.

The darkness is impenetrable even to darkvision, but you can see normally within it. Creatures outside the spell's area, even you, cannot see through it. You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance. Blacklight counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. Daylight counters or dispels blacklight.

As a move action, you can move it up to 30 feet per round in any direction. If it enters a space with a living creature, it stops moving for the round and that creature gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Any creature passing through or ending its turn in the space occupied by the sphere gains one negative level (Fortitude negates). Twenty-four hours after gaining a negative level from the sphere, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC of this save is equal to the DC of this spell) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent. If more than one orb (from different castings of the spell) enters the same space, the orbs automatically fuse together. The resulting orb uses the higher of the two orbs' DCs as its DC and whichever duration has more time left. If the orbs are from different casters, each must make an opposed Intelligence check to move the sphere. An undead creature that passes through or ends its turn in the space occupied by the orb gains 2d4 x 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

The black spot cannot be covered or hidden by any means, including other illusions. The black spot radiates a cursed aura in a 10-foot radius around its target. Anyone within the aura gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against the target. In addition, the target has a -4 penalty on saving throws against death effects. Every day in which a creature bears a black spot, it must make a Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage. The damage cannot be healed until the black spot is removed. If the creature's Constitution reaches 0, it dies.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save. A blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.

Bless Weapon	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Light|Enhancing	CLASSES:Holy Knight=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Weapon touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This enhancement makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the DR of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good-aligned, which means it can bypass the DR of certain creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot. In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a keen weapon or a vorpal sword.
Blight	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Target plant touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude half; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and may attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.

Blink	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	DESC:You "blink" quickly back and forth at the edge of time and look as though you're winking in and out of reality at random. Blink has several effects, as follows. Physical attacks against you have a 50%% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're blinking and not merely invisible. Likewise, your own attacks have a 20%% miss chance, since you sometimes blink just as you are about to strike. Any individually targeted spell has a 50%% chance to fail against you while you're blinking. Your own spells have a 20%% chance to activate just as you blink. While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks. Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures. You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material. While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50%% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.
Blink, Greater	KEY:Blink (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=5	DESC:An immaterial fog descends over your eyes as you complete the spell. You perceive the closeness of a parallel, temporal reality, and you know that you can pass freely between that world and the one upon which you stand. This spell functions like blink, except that you have control over the timing of your �blinking� back and forth on the outskirts of time. You can also ready an action to blink away from any physical or magical attack. The attack misses automatically. While blinking, you have no chance of interfering with your own attacks or your own spells. When moving through solid objects, you do not risk materializing inside one unless you actually end your movement there, in which case you materialize and are shunted off to the nearest open space, taking 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet traveled in this manner.

Requires a ranged touch attack roll to hit that deals 1d6 points of ice damage + your casting modifier (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5) and inflicts the Frozen status effect for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save prevents the status effect from taking effect.
Blizzard II	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Any creature (including the spell's target) within the aura that takes at least 5 points of piercing, slashing, or bleed damage from a single attack automatically creates a spray of burning blood. The spray strikes a creature in a randomly determined square adjacent to the injured creature. The spray deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature in that square, and 1 point of splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the spray's target, including the target of this spell. A creature can only create one spray of burning blood per round. Creatures that do not have blood (including oozes and most constructs and undead) do not create blood sprays when attacked.
Blood Boil	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:3 rounds	SAVEINFO:Fort negates (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The temperature of the target creature's blood (or other similar body fluid) begins to rise over the next 3 rounds during the caster's turn. Each round starting with the first, the target creature attempts a new saving throw at the start of the caster's turn to resist that round's effect. A successful save does not end the spell effect, but does prevent that round's effect. On the round that this spell is cast, the target becomes fatigued. On the next round, as the blood temperature begins to rise, the target's capillaries burst, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage to the target. On the third and final round, the target's blood begins to boil; the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 15d6), and-if the target is still alive-the target becomes exhausted rather than fatigued.

This distortion grants the subject concealment (20%% miss chance). A see invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true seeing spell does. Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
Bone Armor	SOURCEPAGE:p.

If the target makes its save, it takes half damage and is fatigued rather than exhausted. Objects made of bone, chitin, or similar material take half again as much (+50%%) damage from this spell. This spell has no effect on creatures that lack either skeletons or hard carapaces.

Bone Shield	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Dark	CLASSES:Necromancer=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You animate a bone with dark energy, giving it the power to float near your body and interpose itself against physical attacks.

SCHOOL:Healing	CLASSES:Necromancer,White Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates or Will half; see text	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless) or yes, see text	DESC:This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). Unlike other spells that heal damage, breath of life can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its Constitution score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through breath of life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day. Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by breath of life.

Brighten	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Light	CLASSES:White Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature afflicted with Dazzled status effect	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negate	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The target for this spell requires the Dazzled status effect to be in effect. Once you cast this spell, the Dazzled status effect is removed and causes the target to shed bright light out to a 10-ft.-radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 10 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 10-foot radius of this magical light. Brighten brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. This spell does not stack with itself. Brighten can be used to dispel any dark spell of equal or lower spell level. In addition, any dark spells cast require a DC 15 Concentration check or the spell fails.
Brighten II	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Light	CLASSES:White Mage=2	DESC:This spell functions like brighten, but the area of effect increases to 20-ft.-radius and a DC 20 Concentration check is required or the spell fails.

SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Black Mage,Red Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The target of this spell is enveloped in flames, burning for 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and inflicts the Burning status effect. A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the status effect. If the target fails the initial saving throw, it gets another chance to save every round until the duration is ended.
# 563 of 907
Burn II	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Black Mage=7	DESC:This spell functions like Burn, except it deals 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum of 15d8) and inflicts the Burning status effect.
Burning Arc	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One primary target plus one additional target/3 levels (must be within 15 ft. of the primary target)	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex half	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell causes an arc of flame to leap from your fingers, burning a number of enemies nearby. It deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). For every additional target the discharge arcs to, reduce the number of damage dice by half (rounded down). Therefore, at 9th level, your burning arc deals 9d6 points of fire damage to the primary target, then 4d6 points of fire damage to a secondary target, then 2d6 points of fire damage to an additional target. Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You may choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 15 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.
Burning Blood	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy/Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Necromancer=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One living creature; see text	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The taste of copper fills your mouth and bloody spatters punctuate the last few words that unlock the spell. You gag slightly as the blood in your mouth congeals, but disappears even as you release the spell. You taint a living creature's blood with a hot, corrosive infusion, dealing 1d8 points of acid damage and 1d8 points of fire damage per round. The subject can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage, but a successful save does not prevent damage in future rounds. Searing pain limits the subject to a single move action in any round when it fails its Fortitude save. Burning blood does not affect creatures of the construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead types.

Burning Disarm	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Geomancer=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Short	TARGETAREA:Held metal item of one creature or 15 lbs. of unattended metal	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates (object, see text)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	DESC:This spell causes a metal object to instantly become red hot. A creature holding the item may attempt a Reflex save to drop it and take no damage (even if it is not their turn), otherwise the hot metal deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4). Circumstances that prevent the creature from dropping the item (such as a locked gauntlet) mean the creature gets no saving throw. The heat does not harm the item, and it does not get hot enough or last long enough to ignite flammable objects. The item cools to its previous temperature almost instantly. If cast underwater, burning disarm deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.
Burrow	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Geomancer=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:The subject can burrow at a speed of 15 feet (or 10 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load) through sand, loose soil, or gravel, or at a speed of 5 feet through stone. Using burrow requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The burrowing creature cannot charge or run. Loose material collapses behind the target 1 round after it leaves the area. This spell does not give the target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through loose material, the creature must hold its breath and take only short trips, or else it may suffocate.
Burst of Glory	SOURCEPAGE:p.

You shine with a white or golden radiance equal to a torch for the spell's duration, though you can dismiss the glow effect as a free action.

Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by burst of light.
Call Lightning	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Lightning	CLASSES:Geomancer=3	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Reflex half	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of lightning damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected. You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts). If you are outdoors and in a stormy area - a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado - each bolt deals 3d10 points of lightning damage instead of 3d6. This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.
Call Lightning Storm	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Lightning	CLASSES:Geomancer=5	RANGE:Long	DESC:This spell functions like Call Lightning, except that each bolt deals 5d6 points of lightning damage (or 5d10 if created outdoors in a stormy area), and you may call a maximum of 15 bolts.

This extra energy persists in the weapon for the rest of the round, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made during the same round you cast this spell. If the ally targeted for this spell is unwilling to give up her weapon, the spell fails. An unconscious or dying ally is considered a �willing� target so long as the weapon to be called is still in contact with the ally's body.
Celerity	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	DESC:This spell works like lesser celerity, except that you pull even more time into the present. When you cast this spell, you can immediately take a standard action, as if you had readied an action. You can even interrupt another creature's turn when you cast this spell. However, after you take the standard action granted by this spell, you are dazed until the end of your next turn.
Celerity, Greater	KEY:Celerity (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=8	DESC:This spell works like celerity, except upon casting this spell you can immediately take a full-round action (or a standard action plus a move action, or two move actions).

SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Lightning	CLASSES:Black Mage,Red Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:One primary target, plus one secondary target/level which must be no more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex half	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell creates a lightning discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. The bolt deals 1d6 points of lightning damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt. Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

This does not affect the creature's actual Strength in any way, merely the amount of material it can carry while benefiting from this spell. It also has no effect on encumbrance due to armor. If the creature wears armor it still takes the normal penalties for doing so regardless of how much weight the spell allows it to carry.

Choco feather instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. Choco feather works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

SCHOOL:Illusion|Cantrip	CLASSES:Illusionist=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Two creatures	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The targets can converse without anyone overhearing what they are saying. Creatures who can read lips might still be able to determine what is said, but no Perception check can possibly allow one to overhear the conversation. While under the effect of this spell, a target creature can speak to someone not affected by this spell, but everyone can hear that conversation normally. Only when one target creature speaks to the other target creature does the conversation remain private.
Clarion Call	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Fort negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:The subject of this spell gains two benefits. First, the affected creature gains the ability to create a sound like the blast of a mighty horn or trumpet simply by miming the action of sounding one. Second, the subject can speak in a booming voice that carries easily over great distances, lowering the DC of any check to hear what is said by -15. This spell is particularly prized by battlefield commanders and champions who wish to make themselves clearly heard or gain the attention of their allies or foes.
Clashing Rocks	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:See text	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial; see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create two Colossal-sized masses of rock, dirt, and stone and slam them together against a single creature between them. The clashing rocks appear up to 30 feet away from the target on opposite sides and rush toward it with a mighty grinding crash. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target with the rocks. The clashing rocks ignore concealment and cover, and if there is a solid barrier between the target and either of the clashing rocks, the spell has a +28 bonus on the Strength check to burst through the barrier and continue unimpeded to the target. A creature struck by the clashing rocks takes 20d6 points of damage (half earth and half bludgeoning) and is knocked prone. If the target fails a Reflex Saving Throw, it is also buried under the resulting rubble as if by a cave-in. If the clashing rocks miss the target, the target still takes 10d6 points of damage (half earth and half bludgeoning) from falling rocks and is knocked prone. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage to half and the target remains standing. Creatures other than the target that occupy the spaces where the clashing rocks appear or within their path (30 feet wide, 30 feet high, and up to 60 feet long) must also make Reflex saves or take 10d6 points of damage (half earth and half bludgeoning) and be knocked prone (save for half and remain standing). A creature can only take damage once from the clashing rocks, no matter how many times the clashing rocks pass over a target creature.

Cloak of Winds	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,Red Mage,White Mage=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind. The subject is never checked or blown away by strong winds of windstorm or lesser strength (whether natural or magically created), and ranged attack rolls against the subject take a -4 penalty. Tiny or smaller creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save to successfully touch or attack the subject in melee. Failure knocks the attacker prone and pushes it 5 feet away from the subject per level of the caster. This movement can pass through the squares of other creatures without affecting them and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but the creature takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage, plus 1d6 if the creature strikes a solid object that blocks its movement.
Clockwork Timer	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=2	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One spell	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You delay a spell by up to 1 min./caster level. This delay affects an area or instantaneous spell that you cast immediately after casting clockwork timer. When the time expires, the delayed spell is immediately activated. The spell generates a distinctive ticking sound that can be heard with a DC 15 Perception check within 50 ft. of the spell effect. A successful dispel removes both clockwork timer and the spell it is delaying. A caster who spends 10 min. crafting a clockwork timer and then succeeds on a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell level) makes the timer more resistant to dispel and similar effects, increasing the dispel DC by +4.

TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst	DURATION:Instantaneous; see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD. Sightless creatures are not affected by color spray. 2 HD or less: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.) 3 or 4 HD: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round. 5 or more HD: The creature is stunned for 1 round.

SCHOOL:Light|Enfeebling	CLASSES:Holy Knight=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:See text	DESC:Whenever a creature you can see that threatens you makes an attack against one of your allies, as an immediate action, you can compel that creature to attack you instead. When you compel a creature to attack you, you must first overcome that creature's spell resistance, and the creature can attempt a Will saving throw to ignore the compulsion.

TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex half	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6 points of ice damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).
Confusion	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Black Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The target of this spell receives the Confuse status effect.

Congeal Water	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enfeebling|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Blue Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:1d4 minutes	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Creature Learned From (BM only): Fuath Gremlin	DESC:&nl;The caster emulates the fuath gremlin's ability to surround a creature in a thin layer of magically viscous water. A target that fails the Reflex save becomes entangled and must hold its breath or risk drowning. The target or an adjacent creature can spend a full-round action on its turn scraping off the clinging fluid, allowing a new Reflex save with a +2 bonus; otherwise, the effect lasts for 1d4 minutes.
Contagion	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Living creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The subject contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom. The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply). Use the disease's listed frequency and save DC to determine further effects. For more information see Diseases.
Contagion, Greater	KEY:Contagion (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell functions as contagion, except the victim cannot overcome the disease without magic-making the required number of saves does not cure it. The DC to remove the disease with esuna is equal to the save DC + 5.
Contagious Flame	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Black Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Three or more rays	DURATION:3 rounds	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You blast several enemies with beams of fire. You may fire three rays, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 11th (to a maximum of five rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously. Every round on your turn, a new ray of fire launches from each creature who took damage from the spell in the previous round-these new rays attack as if you fired them, but their point of origin is the previous creature damaged. You can choose the new targets as a free action, all of whom must be within close range of their new starting point. This contagion of flame continues for a total of three rounds-a creature can be struck more than once by this spell over the course of these three rounds, although never by a ray of fire that launches from itself.

Contingency	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=6	CASTTIME:At least 10 minutes; see text	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 day/level (D) or until discharged	DESC:You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting contingency. The contingency spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast contingency. The spell to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level). The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You can use only one contingency spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.
Contingent Action	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:An advancement of the moment spell, contingent action allows the caster to prepare himself in an instant. The caster of this spell prepares a readied action. Though he may cast this spell, readying the action and still move, the readied action otherwise follows all the normal rules.

Contingent Spell Immunity	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=5	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 day/level, until discharged (D)	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This powerful, protective spell is similar in effect to the contingency spell. When he casts this spell, the caster must designate a spell against which it will be effective. The spell must be on his spell list and he must possess the spell in the form of a scroll, though he need not have created it himself. The spell can be no higher than 4th level. If the recipient of this spell is affected by the designated spell while under the influence of contingent spell immunity, the spell's effects are completely negated as if by Spell Resistance. Contingent spell immunity protects from one use of the spell per 5 levels of the caster before discharging. A single target may only benefit from one casting of contingent spell immunity. A second casting of this spell negates all previous castings.
Control Undead	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Up to 2 HD/level of undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell enables you to control undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior. Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them, and they may seek revenge after the spell's effects end.
Control Water	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Geomancer=4|Black Mage,White Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:Water in a volume of 10 ft./level by 10 ft./level by 2 ft./level (S)	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None; see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas. Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell (Will negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land. With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect.

Control Weather	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Geomancer=5	CASTTIME:10 minutes; see text	RANGE:2 miles	TARGETAREA:2-mile-radius circle, centered on you; see text	DURATION:4d12 hours; see text	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. You can also use this spell to cause the weather in the area to become calm and normal for the season. You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather--where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously. Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them. Season Possible Weather Spring Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather Summer Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm Autumn Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet Winter Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw Late winter Hurricane-force winds or early spring

You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an "eye" of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit.	DESC:&nl;Wind Direction: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area.	DESC:&nl;* A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.	DESC:&nl;* An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center.	DESC:&nl;* Rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.	DESC:&nl;* A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.	DESC:&nl;Wind Strength: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a Fortitude save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area. See Environment for more details.	DESC:&nl;Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.	DESC:&nl;A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.	DESC:&nl;A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.	DESC:&nl;Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, uproot large trees, and cause most ships to founder.	DESC:&nl;A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.

All creatures caught within the cone are entangled, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. The webbed victims take 1d6 points of non-elemental damage per round while in the web.	DESC:The strands of the web are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire-a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, and so forth-can set the webs alight and burn away in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

Your melee touch attack deals 7d6 points of shadow damage. This damage manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.

The handholds' path can span up to 30 feet out from you plus an additional 10 feet per 3 caster levels (maximum 90 feet at 18th level). The handholds protrude approximately 6 inches from the wall, measure 10 inches lengthwise, and are perfectly suited for gripping with fingers or claws.

Despite the spell's name, it works on any melee weapon (not just blades). While your weapon is dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and you are not considered armed with the weapon. It remains in your space and accompanies you everywhere, whether you move by physical or magical means. The weapon cannot be disarmed.

SCHOOL:Enfeebling|Dark	CLASSES:Black Mage,Necromancer=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Object touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20-foot radius. This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20%% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50%% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of darkness. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than darkness. If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed. This spell does not stack with itself. Darkness can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.

Daylight	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Light	CLASSES:Holy Knight,White Mage=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Object touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light. If daylight is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed. Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Daylight counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as darkness and blacklight.

In combat, the flashing movements of a dazzling blade become almost hypnotic. The wielder of a weapon under the effects of dazzling blade gains a +1 competence bonus on all Bluff checks made to feint in combat. The wielder also gains a +1 competence bonus on all CMB checks made to disarm a foe, and a +1 competence bonus to his CMD against disarm attempts made against the weapon bearing the dazzling blade effect. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 caster levels, to a maximum bonus of +5 at 12th level. The wielder of a dazzling blade can discharge the spell into a blinding burst of silvery light as a free action. The wielder selects an adjacent opponent as the focal point of this burst of light-that creature must make a Will save to avoid being blinded for 1 round (with a successful save, the creature is instead dazzled for 1 round). Despite its shiny appearance, a dazzling blade grants no extra benefit against creatures that are vulnerable to silver.

If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells.

Delay Death	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:The subject of this powerful spell is unable to die from hit point damage. While under the protection of this spell, the normal limit of the negative constitution score before a character dies is extended without limit. A condition or spell that destroys enough of the subject's body so as to not allow raise to work, still kills the creature, as does death brought about by ability score damage, level drain, or a death effect. The spell does not prevent the subject from entering the dying state by dropping to -1 hit points. It merely prevents death as a result of hit point loss. If the subject has fewer than hit points than negative its constitution score when the spell's duration expires, it dies instantly.
Delay Disease	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:24 hours	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You press your focus to the creature and implore the contagion that ravages it to lie dormant. As the spell takes effect, a dim yellow glow passes over the creature's body. The progress of any nonmagical disease that already afflicts the target is halted for the duration of the spell. Delay disease allows the subject to skip the required saving throw against the disease for the day that the spell is in effect. During this period, the subject accrues no further ability damage from the disease. A skipped saving throw counts as neither a success nor a failure for the purpose of recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the incubation period of any disease to which the subject is exposed during the spell's duration does not begin until the spell expires. Delay disease does not cure any damage that a disease might already have dealt, and it has no effect on magical or supernatural diseases.

You must cast this spell before the results of the creature's actions are determined. This may result in the creature's action being invalid, such as attacking a target that has moved, in which case the action is wasted. If the target was casting a spell, they do not need to make a concentration check.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:	DESC:&nl;Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6x10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days	DESC:&nl;Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

Forms of movement barred include bend space and time, blink, dimension door, shadow walk, and similar spell-like abilities. Once dimensional lock is in place, extradimensional travel into or out of the area is not possible. A dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

Disguise Self	SOURCEPAGE:p.

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your creature type (although you can appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person or gender. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the illusion gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.
Dispel	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Black Mage,Dark Knight,Holy Knight,Red Mage,Time Mage,White Mage=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium Target or	TARGETAREA:One spellcaster, creature, or object	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You can use dispel to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by dispel. Dispel can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel can take effect. You choose to use dispel in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Counterspell: When dispel is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Dispel, Greater	KEY:Dispel (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Black Mage,Red Mage,Time Mage,White Mage=6	TARGETAREA:One spellcaster, creature, or object; or a 20-ft.-radius burst	DESC:This spell functions like dispel, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures. You choose to use greater dispel in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: This functions as a targeted dispel, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. Additionally, greater dispel has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC. Area Dispel: When greater dispel is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by dispel. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object. You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. Counterspell: This functions as dispel, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Dream	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=5	CASTTIME:1 minute	RANGE:Unlimited	TARGETAREA:One living creature touched	DURATION:See text	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You, or a messenger you touch, send a message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message. If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell. Creatures who don't sleep or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell. The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always failing any saving throw) while in the trance.

You feel a pressure in your mind as you begin to relay the intent of your dreaming contact. This spell functions like dream, except as noted above and that you can alter the sleeping person's dreams to produce a specific desired effect. The dreamer gets a Will saving throw to resist the additional effects of this spell; if the save succeeds, the dream casting spell can send only a message, in the manner of a dream spell. If the saving throw fails, you decide what additional effect the message carries. Fear: Your image in the dream is surrounded by intimidating imagery and an aura of power. For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he is shaken. This is a compulsion and fear effect. Charm: Your image in the dream appears particularly helpful and kind. For the duration of the spell, the dreamer is under the effect of a charm spell. This is a charm effect. Rage: Your image in the dream taunts and harasses the dreamer. For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he preferentially attacks you if in a combat situation. The dreamer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls when attacking you while under this effect. This is a compulsion effect. Confusion: Your image in the dream behaves in a bizarre and irrational manner. For the duration of the spell, the dreamer behaves in an unusual manner; he is confused for (CASTERLEVEL) rounds.

If protected against fire damage, it can move through lava. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. It requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally, but cannot charge or run. Casting move earth on an area containing the target flings the target back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round (DC 15 Fort negates). This spell does not give the target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through solid material, the creature must hold its breath.

SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Geomancer=8	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:80-ft.-radius spread (S)	DURATION:1 round	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:When you cast earth rupture, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earth rupture affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earth rupture spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.	DESC:&nl;* Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.	DESC:&nl;* Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).	DESC:&nl;* Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details).	DESC:&nl;* Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).	DESC:&nl;* River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.	DESC:&nl;* Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

Additionally, if two or more blue mages are within 20 feet of each other and have this spell, they can work together to create a lethal shock once every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing blue mage. All creatures within that radius take 2d8 points of lightning damage for each blue mage contributing to the electric shock, to a maximum of 12d8.

The subject gains elemental resistance 10 against the elemental type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the elemental resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. Elemental resistance absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects. Elemental resistance overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from elements. If a character is warded by protection from elements and elemental resistance, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

Elemental Weapon	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:All|Earth|Fire|Ice|Lightning|Water|Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Magic weapon of elements	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Choose an elemental type: earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind. Upon completing the casting of this spell, a weapon made of the elemental type chosen appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 points of elemental damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of whatever weapon you want and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Intelligence modifier as its attack bonus. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the elemental weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. An elemental weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel affects it. An elemental weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has Spell Resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that Spell Resistance the first time the elemental weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell to deal earth, fire, ice, lightning, water, or wind damage, it is a spell of that type.

You can make the duplicate up to two size categories larger than you are and determine a theme as to how it alters your original appearance. However, this duplicate always retains some vestiges of your actual appearance. Creatures who already know you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to disbelieve this spell. Your duplicate has no actual substance, and you cannot use it to alter its surroundings or to attack or otherwise harm creatures it encounters. You can use the duplicate to speak, and interact verbally with creatures using the Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skills, and you gain a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks when using that skill through the duplicate. You can see, hear, taste, and smell your duplicate's surroundings as if you are actually present using your Perception skill. While you also remain aware of your own immediate surroundings when controlling your duplicate, controlling it does take a toll on your senses. You take a -4 penalty on Perception checks while you control your duplicate. The duplicate moves under your mental command, and while you need not act out its movements, you must take a standard action to control your duplicate for 1 round (concentrating on the spell) or it winks out of existence. You can maintain control of your duplicate even if you have no line of sight or line of effect to it. The duplicate immediately winks out of existence if it is hit by an attack or in the area of a damaging effect, or if it moves beyond the maximum range of the spell.

Creatures that fail are compelled to dance and shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered for the duration of this spell. Once a creature makes the save against this spell, it is immune to further fiddle effects from that caster for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.

You provoke no attacks of opportunity when launching them. Any shuriken you do not launch as part of casting this spell remains floating near you for the spell's duration. On rounds subsequent to your casting of this spell, you can spend a swift action to launch one of these remaining shuriken or a standard action to launch any number of these remaining shuriken.

SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:5-ft.-diameter sphere	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:When you cast this spell, your body takes on a slick, oily appearance. For the duration of this spell, your form can stretch and shift with ease and becomes slightly transparent, as if you were composed of liquid. This transparency is not enough to grant concealment. You gain DR 10/slashing and your reach increases by 10 feet. In addition, you can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with anything you were carrying at the time the spell was cast (except other creatures). Finally, you can move through water with a swim speed of 60 feet and can breathe both water and air for the duration of this effect. You are treated as if you had the water subtype while this spell is in effect.

It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the fly spell is dispelled

You deal normal weapon damage from the blow, but also deal an additional amount of force damage equal to 1d4 points per caster level (maximum of 10d4). The force of the blow may be enough to knock the target backward as well. To determine if the target is pushed back, make a combat maneuver check with a bonus equal to your caster level to resolve a bull rush attempt against the creature struck. You do not move as a result of this free bull rush, but it can push the target back if it defeats the target's CMD. A successful Fortitude save halves the force damage and negates the bull rush effect.
Foresight	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC. When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves.

All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail. The subject automatically succeeds on any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin. The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The freedom of movement spell does not, however, grant water breathing.

A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of ice damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the status effect. If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so. You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.

You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed.

Geyser	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:Spout of boiling water filling a 5 ft. square and spraying upward 10 ft./2 levels	DURATION:Concentration + (CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial; see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You cause a column of boiling water to spring forth from any horizontal surface, knocking over creatures directly over it and exposing nearby creatures to searing droplets as its spray falls back to the ground. Any creature entering the geyser, or occupying the square it appears in, must make a Reflex Saving Throw to avoid being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If the creature fails its Saving Throw, it takes 3d6 points of water damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 50 feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone in a random square adjacent to the geyser. A successful Saving Throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature's normal movement. In addition, the geyser sprays boiling water in a hemispherical emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation is equal to one-half the geyser's height (e.g., a 50-foot geyser has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area, including yourself, takes 1d6 points of water damage each round as droplets of boiling water cascade on them. You can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain that's smaller than what would be created by a full-height geyser spell.
Ghost Sound	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion|Cantrip	CLASSES:Illusionist=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Illusory sounds	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief	SPELLRES:No	DESC:Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humes per caster level (maximum 40 humes). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humes running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humes, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humes. Anyone who hears a ghost sound receives a Will save to disbelieve. Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell.

Ghostly Disguise	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You make yourself-including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment-appear translucent like a ghost. Any mundane or magical disguise on you is affected by this illusion as well; for example, if you are disguised as the king or a sahuagin, you look like a ghostly version of the king or a sahuagin. Your ghostly form may have a pale green, blue, or violet coloration, or a muted version of your normal appearance. The spell does not actually make you ghostly or provide any incorporeal abilities. If you choose, the illusion can make you appear to float slightly above the ground, though you are actually still on the ground. A creature that interacts with the illusion gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.

A paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become sickened (Fortitude negates). A poisona spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.

SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Until landing or (CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You take no damage from falls (as if from choco feather). In addition, you can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot you fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round. You cannot use this spell to actually gain height, merely coast in other directions as you fall. If subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes you to rise you can take advantage of it in order to increase the distance you can glide. The spell ends as soon as your feet touch the ground regardless of its remaining duration. If the spell expires while you are still in the air you fall the remaining distance as normal.

SCHOOL:Light|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Ice	CLASSES:White Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Wall of ice or flying ice javelins (see text)	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes, instantaneous, or until expended (see text)	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates or none (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell creates a large mass of frozen holy water that can be used for one of two effects. Holy Ice Wall: This functions like wall of ice (hemisphere or plane). Any creature that touches or attacks the ice wall with melee attacks takes 1 point of holy damage; extended contact with the wall (such as standing or walking on it) deals 1d6 points of holy damage. Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid holy air remains. Any creature that steps through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (no save); half of this damage is ice damage and the other half is holy damage. Holy Ice Javelins: The spell creates a number of javelins of frozen holy water in your square equal to your caster level (maximum 15), which hurl themselves toward one or more targets that are no more than 10 feet away from each other. You must succeed on attack rolls (one per javelin) to hit the target with the javelin, using your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier. The javelins deal 1d6 points of ice damage each, plus 1 point of holy damage per caster level. The javelins are destroyed by this attack.

The subject of the spell gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

Holy Shield	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Light	CLASSES:Holy Knight=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You gain the ability to magically project the defense of your shield to protect another creature at a distance. As a swift action, you designate one target within 30 feet. The target gains your shield's shield bonus and enhancement bonus to Armor Class until your next turn; you gain no benefit from the shield's shield bonus or enhancement bonus while using this spell and cannot use any of the shield's other properties or abilities (such as magical abilities, making a shield bash, or providing cover with a tower shield). As a swift action, you may move the protection to another target (including yourself); if you move the protection to yourself, you may use any of the shield's properties or abilities as normal. If the shielded creature exceeds the 30-foot range, your shield's protection automatically reverts to you. Any circumstance that would make you lose your shield bonus (such as an enemy breaking the shield, you dropping the shield, or you becoming helpless or unconscious) means the protected creature loses the shield's benefit.
Holy Smite	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enfeebling|Light	CLASSES:Holy Knight,White Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius burst	DURATION:Instantaneous (1 round); see text	SAVEINFO:Will partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected. The spell deals 1d8 points of holy damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of holy damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect. The spell deals only half damage to creatures that are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

Holy Sword	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Light	CLASSES:Holy Knight=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Melee weapon touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 holy weapon (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a magic circle against evil effect (as the spell). If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one holy sword at a time. If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with bless weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.
Holy Weapon	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Light	CLASSES:White Mage=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Magic weapon of light	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A weapon made of light appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 points of holy damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of whatever weapon you want and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the holy weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. A holy weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel affects it. A holy weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has Spell Resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that Spell Resistance the first time the holy weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

DESC:&nl;* A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4x10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6x10 feet and takes 2d6 points of wind damage due to battering and buffeting.	DESC:&nl;* Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x10 feet.	DESC:&nl;* Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6x5 feet.	DESC:&nl;* Large or larger creatures may move normally within a hurricane blast effect.	DESC:&nl;Hurricane blast can't move a creature beyond the limit of its range. Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a hurricane blast. The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50%% chance to extinguish those lights. In addition to the effects noted, a hurricane blast can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.
Hydraulic Torrent	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:60 ft.	TARGETAREA:60-ft. line	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:&nl;You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past. Against creatures and movable objects this stream acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a Bull Rush attempt and apply its results to each creature within the area. Your Attack roll for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you to make a Strength check to destroy the target. When attempting to break an object, the stream has an effective Strength equal to your caster level plus the ability score modifier as above. The Break DC depends on the object you're trying to break (see Damaging Objects for sample Break DCs for various objects.) Hydraulic torrent extinguishes any normal fires it encounters along its path. Magical fires are unaffected.

SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Colorful lights in a 10-ft.-radius spread	DURATION:Concentration + 2 rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:&nl;A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of HD of creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.

SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Ice	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:&nl;Your form transmutes into living ice, granting you several abilities. You gain the ice subtype and damage reduction 5/magic. You are immune to ability score damage, blindness, critical hits, deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters) plus 1d6 points of ice damage and inflicts the Frozen status effect. You are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. You may burrow through non-magical ice or snow at your base speed as easily as a fish swims through water. You can move through magical ice and snow if you succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect; you automatically succeed on caster level checks against effects that you created. Your passage through snow and ice in this fashion leaves behind no tunnel or hole.

Ice Spears	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Ice	CLASSES:Geomancer=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:1 ice spear/4 levels	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex half and see below	SPELLRES:No	DESC:&nl;Upon casting this spell, one or more giant spears of ice lance up out of the ground. Each stalagmite-like icicle affects a 5-foot square and tapers to a height of 10 feet. You may cause a number of ice spears equal to one spear for every four caster levels you possess to burst from the ground. A creature that occupies a square from which a spear extends (or that is within 10 feet of the ground below) takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of ice damage per square-creatures that take up more than one square can be hit by multiple spears if the caster is high enough level. The explosive growth can also trip foes. When the spears erupt from the ground, they make a combat maneuver check against any targets that take damage from the spears, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Wisdom modifier. Each additional ice spear beyond the first that strikes a single foe grants a +10 bonus to this CMB check. If the check succeeds, the ice spears knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt. If you cast this spell upon an area covered with ice or snow, such as atop a glacier, frozen lake, or snow-covered field, the spears strike with additional force. Saves against the effect suffer a -2 penalty and the spell gains a +4 bonus on its combat maneuver check to trip foes. Ice spears created by this spell remain after they do their damage. They melt as normal depending on the surrounding environment. They no longer damage foes in their square, but can provide cover. An ice spear has hardness 5 and 30 hit points.

This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, heavy snow and sleet rains down in the area. Creatures inside this area take a -4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the snow and hail disappear, leaving no after-effects (other than the damage dealt).

If the creature fails its save, it is helpless, but can still breathe (the ice blocks line of effect to the target). If the target makes its save, it gains the entangled condition but can otherwise act normally. Whether or not the target saves, it takes 1 point of ice damage per caster level each round it is helpless or entangled in the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness; if broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as a full-round action with a successful Strength check (DC 15 + your caster level).

Illusion of Calm	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will disbelieve (on hit; see below)	SPELLRES:No	DESC:When casting this spell, you create an illusory double that takes the same space of you. That double makes it look like you are standing still, even when you are not. While under the effects of this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you cast a spell, make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, or move out of your first square during a move action. It does not hide ranged attacks made with any type of projectile weapon. When a creature hits you with an attack of any type, it gains a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. On a successful saving throw, it successfully disbelieves and the spell's effect ends for that creature.
Illusory Pit	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=6	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:10-ft. cube/level	DURATION:Concentration + (CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You shove downward with your hand, speaking the spell's arcane words as you do so. The ground disappears where you indicate, forming an impossibly deep pit. You create the illusion of a pit, and each creature entering or within the area is forced to make a Will save or believe the floor on which it stands has become a bottomless chasm. Those that fail their saves fall prone and are unable to take any action except clawing desperately at the floor in the hopes of stopping their apparent fall. An attack on an affected creature frees it from the effect of the illusion but leaves it stunned for 1 round. Likewise, when the spell ends, creatures that believed they were falling are stunned for 1 round. Flying creatures passing over an illusory pit are unaffected by the spell.

The first creature hit by the poisoned weapon must make a Will save against the illusion spell; success means the spell has no effect and is expended from the weapon. If the creature fails its save, it believes it has been poisoned and must make Fortitude saves at the spell's DC to avoid suffering illusory poison damage. Esuna, esunaga, restore, restora, or restoraga immediately recovers all damage from the spell. A successful dispel spell ends the effect of the illusion, as do spells that penetrate illusions (such as true seeing). The target automatically recovers all illusory poison damage after 1 hour. Phantasmal Poison Type poison, injury; Save Fortitude DC as the spell Frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; Effect 1d3 Str damage; Cure 1 save
Illusory Script	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=3	CASTTIME:1 minute per page	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.	DURATION:One day/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The illusory script appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character. Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include "Close the book and leave," "Forget the existence of this note," and so forth. If successfully dispelled by dispel, the illusory script and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic spell.
Illusory Wall	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Image 1 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. Although the caster can see through his illusory wall, other creatures cannot, even if they succeed at their Will save (but they do learn that it is not real).

Intercept Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing	CLASSES:Holy Knight=2	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:If there is an ally adjacent to you, this spell wards the ally and creates a mystic connection so that all of its wounds transfer to you. The ally takes no damage from a singular attack (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, level drain or death effects. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not deal the types listed above such as blown away, charm, compulsion, and knocked down conditions and effects, are not affected.
Invisibility Sphere	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=3	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation around the creature	DESC:This spell functions like disappear, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient at the time the spell is cast. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient. Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility sphere ends.

Iron Body	SOURCEPAGE:p.

You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, earth, lightning, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a -6 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 35%% and a -6 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

Keep Watch	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing	CLASSES:Holy Knight=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One creature/2 levels	DURATION:8 hours or less; see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell enables the subjects to stand watch or keep vigil throughout the night without any ill effects. The subjects suffer no fatigue and gain all the usual benefits of a full night's rest. The subjects gain hit points as though from resting, spellcasters may gain MP as though they had slept for 8 hours, and so on. Effects that rely on actual sleep or dreaming are ineffective, though the subjects are still susceptible to effects that would put them to sleep, such as sleep or deep slumber. Any vigorous activity, including fighting, immediately ends the effect, and the affected creatures must either have the spell cast on them again or sleep for the remaining hours to avoid fatigue and gain the benefits of a full night's rest.

The spell is effective in any environment in which "north" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.

A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed). A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.

This shell enables the subjects to breathe freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making them immune to harmful gases and vapors, including inhaled diseases and poisons. In addition, the shell protects subjects from extremes of temperature (per endure elements) as well as extremes of pressure. Life bubble does not provide protection from negative or positive energy (such as found on the Negative and Positive Energy planes), the ability to see in conditions of poor visibility (such as in smoke or fog), nor the ability to move or act normally in conditions that impede movement (such as underwater). When you cast this spell it has a total duration of 2 hours per caster level. You can divide this duration up in any manner you wish, not necessarily equally, between up to 1 creature per caster level.

The bolt begins at your fingertips. The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures in this line take 10d6 points of lightning damage and are staggered for 1 round (a successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered condition, spell resistance applies). Objects in your path are damaged as well, with combustible objects being set ablaze and metals with low melting points melted. If your path is interrupted by a barrier or otherwise deflected, you materialize short of your final destination in the nearest open space; targets in the line to that point take damage as normal. You are immune to the lightning element while this spell lasts.

Loathsome Veil	SOURCEPAGE:p.

One side of the veil, chosen by you at the time of casting, is harmless. The other side twists and turns into impossible shapes, affecting any creature with 60 feet who views the veil. The veil affects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell are affected first. The effect is according to the creature's HD. 4 HD or fewer: The creature is nauseated while it can see the veil, nauseated for 1d4 rounds after it last saw the veil, then sickened for 2d4 rounds after it last saw the veil. 8 HD or fewer: The creature is nauseated for 1d4 rounds, sickened while it can see the veil, then sickened for 1d4 rounds after it last saw the veil. 9 or more HD: The creature is sickened while it can see the veil. A successful saving throw ignores all effects of the veil. Sightless creatures are not affected by loathsome veil. Affected creatures can avert or close their eyes to avoid seeing the veil, similar to avoiding a gaze attack.

In addition, lycanthropes attempting to assume animal or hybrid form within the affected area take a -5 penalty on Constitution checks to do so.

Maddening Whispers	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=9	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature/level	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Creating an illusion of hissing and whispering softly, you stir feelings of confusion and madness in the targets' minds. You can choose to inflict one of the following conditions upon any creatures that fail their saving throws. Hysteria: The subjects fall into fits of uncontrollable laughing or crying (equal chance for either). Hysterical creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single move action per turn. Panic: The subjects become panicked. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers. Violent Hallucinations: The subjects perceive any nearby creatures as dangerous enemies, attacking the nearest ones and fighting until the subjects are slain or until no more creatures are in sight. Stupor: The subjects curl up on the floor and remain oblivious to events around them. Characters in a stupor are effectively stunned and prone.
Mage Armor	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Unlike mundane armor, mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
Magic Aura	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One touched object weighting up to 5 lbs./level	DURATION:1 day/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None; see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You alter an item's aura so that it registers to Spellcraft skill checks to detect magic as though it were non-magical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. If the object bearing magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is. If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), magic aura doesn't work. Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's Spell Resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from good), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' Spell Resistance. This spell is not cumulative with protection from good and vice versa.

Magic Jar	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until you return to your body	SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:By casting magic jar, you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the magic jar), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the magic jar. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. While in the magic jar, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by protection from evil or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the magic jar if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. If the host body is slain, you return to the magic jar, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the magic jar, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the magic jar returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the magic jar or the host's location.

Magic Mouth	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature or object	DURATION:Permanent until discharged	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:Yes (object)	DESC:This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Magic mouth can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level illusionist can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside from magic. Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.

Meld into Stone	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Geomancer=3	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:Meld into stone enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of non-living gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted. While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage. Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage. The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying.	DESC:&nl;* Stone to flesh expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.	DESC:&nl;* Stone shape deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you.	DESC:&nl;* Transmute rock to mud expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled.	DESC:&nl;* Finally, passwall expels you without damage.

TARGETAREA:One object of up to 1 lb./level	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	DESC:This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the object. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than that of the object. Magic items that are destroyed (at 0 hit points or less) can be repaired with this spell, but this spell does not restore their magic abilities. This spell does not affect creatures (including constructs). This spell has no effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair damage done to such items.

When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn't transcend language barriers. To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.

Mirage Arcana	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	TARGETAREA:One 20-ft. cube/level (S)	DURATION:Concentration + (CASTERLEVEL) hours (D)	DESC:This spell functions like hallucinatory terrain, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike hallucinatory terrain, the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).
Mirror Image	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	DESC:This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you. When mirror image is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment. An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).

Mislead	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist,Red Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:You/One illusory double	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see text	SAVEINFO:None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You become invisible (as greater vanish), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (as major image) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the illusion appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the illusion can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so. The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The greater vanish lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

Moment of Prescience	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=8	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged	DESC:This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the moment of prescience before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one moment of prescience active on you at the same time.

SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=6	CASTTIME:See text	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:Dirt in an area up to 750 ft. square and up to 10 ft. deep (S)	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell moves dirt (clay, loam, sand, and soil), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth. In no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move. This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacial fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle. This spell has no effect on earth creatures.

The target attacks its nearest ally on its next turn with a melee weapon or natural weapon. If necessary, it moves to or charges to the nearest ally in order to make this attack. If it is unable to reach its closest ally on its next turn, the target uses its turn to get as close as possible to the ally.

SCHOOL:Dark	CLASSES:Black Mage,Dark Knight,Necromancer=1	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature afflicted with Dimmed status effect	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negate	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The target for this spell requires the Dimmed status effect to be in effect. Once you cast this spell, the Dimmed status effect is removed and causes the target to radiate darkness out to a 10-ft.-radius. This spell causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (10%% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (25%% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with darkvision can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of obscure. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than obscure. This spell does not stack with itself. Obscure can be used to dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.
# 697 of 907
Obscure II	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Dark	CLASSES:Black Mage,Dark Knight,Necromancer=2	DESC:This spell functions like obscure, but the area of effect increases to 20-ft.-radius. Concealment increases miss chance to 20%% in dim light and 50%% miss chance in darkness.

Omen of Peril	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:A brief glimpse into the future gives you a vision that hints at how dangerous the immediate future is likely to be. Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path of travel, you receive one of three visions that reflect the next hour's journey: safety, peril, or great danger. The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70%% +1%% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%%; the DM makes the roll secretly. If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two.	DESC:&nl;* Safety: You aren't in any immediate danger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you are if you have been stationary for some time before casting the spell), you will face no significant monsters, traps, or other challenges for the next hour or so.	DESC:&nl;* Peril: You will face challenges typical of an adventure: challenging but not overwhelming monsters, dangerous traps, and other hazards for the next hour or so.	DESC:&nl;* Great Danger: Your very life is at grave risk. You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour. If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly.	DESC:&nl;*Choosing which vision is �correct� takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters' likely courses of action and what dangers they're likely to face.
Overwhelming Presence	SOURCEPAGE:p.

A creature that fails a save against this spell falls to the ground and prostrates itself before you, believing it bows before a holy presence. A flying creature incapable of hovering must land immediately in order to prostrate itself. These creatures are considered to be helpless for the duration of the spell. Each round on its turn, a target of this spell may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that recovers from this spell early after being affected by it for at least 1 round takes 1d6 points of Wisdom drain and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A creature that makes the initial save to resist this spell is merely staggered for 1 round.

The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the passwall or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

An old hag can be returned to a beautiful and youthful maiden, an aged warrior whose strength has left him can be returned to his physical prime but with all the benefits of his well-earned experience.

TARGETAREA:40-ft.-high downdraft of wind in a 100-foot line	DURATION:Concentration + 1 round	SAVEINFO:Fort negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:With a sweeping gesture, you call forth mighty winds to clear a path ahead of you. The winds are the equivalent of a windstorm. During the first round of the spell, the winds sweep the designated area clear of anything of Small or smaller size, blowing it outward to the sides of the spell's effect (50%% chance of landing on either side). You may move within the effect without penalty, though all other creatures are subject to the wind's effects. On the second and all later rounds of the spell, the edges of the effect are treated as a wind wall. If the effect includes a body of water or other liquid, the winds create a channel up to 40 feet deep into the surface of the liquid. On your turn as a move action, you can move the effect of this spell, either rotating it at one of its ends up to 45 degrees, or moving it up to 50 feet in line with its current orientation (toward you or away from you).

Permanency	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 hour	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:See text	DURATION:Permanent; see text	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell makes the duration of other spells permanent. You first cast the desired spell and then follow it with the permanency spell. Depending on the spell, you must be of a minimum caster level to cast the spell and must expend a specific gil value (2,000 gil x spell level) of diamond dust as a material component. Permanency can only be dispelled only by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell.

Phantasmal Disorientation	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:10 min./level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create ever-shifting phantasmal terrain and landmarks that confuse the subject when it tries to move. The very ground seems to shift and twist beneath the subject's feet, and the landscape seems to move of its own accord. The subject finds it nearly impossible to walk in a straight line. Each round the subject of a phantasmal disorientation wants to move, he must attempt a DC 20 Survival check to discern the true landmarks from the phantasmal ones. If he succeeds, he moves normally. If he fails, he instead moves in a direction 90 degrees to either side (equal chance of going left or right). Because of the phantasmal disorientation, the subject doesn't realize he's headed in the wrong direction until he meaningfully interacts with his environment (by making an attack or manipulating an object such as a door, for example) or the round ends. If the subject discovers he's moved in the wrong direction before the round is over, he can make a new Survival check to try to move in the right direction, but he won't know whether the second check failed until he interacts with the environment again or the round ends. A phantasmal disorientation spell affects only movement. Creatures subject to it can still fight, cast spells, and otherwise act normally.

SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage. If the subject of a phantasmal killer attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.
Phantasmal Revenge	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch and unlimited; see text	TARGETAREA:Dead body touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:When you cast this eerie spell upon a recently slain creature, you cause a ghastly, spectral image of it to rise up from its corpse, shrieking for vengeance before it vanishes in a burst of unnatural light. This phantom then unerringly seeks out the creature that killed it, as long as that creature is on the same plane, and tries to slay its killer in turn. Only the corpse's killer can see the phantasmal image created by this spell. You and any others who witness the spell's casting or its ultimate effects see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. If that save fails, the target must succeed on Fortitude Saving Throw or take 10 points of damage per caster level from the phantasmal image. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level. You know immediately if the spell succeeded or failed to kill its target but gain no other information, including the identity of the target of the spell. The creature providing the corpse must have died no more than 1 day per caster level prior to the casting of this spell. If the creature that provided the corpse was not, in fact, killed by another, or if the killer is dead or no longer on the same plane, the spell fails. Phantasmal revenge makes no moral judgments; it targets winners of fair fights just as easily as murderers. Any given body can only be targeted by a phantasmal revenge spell once.

SCHOOL:Illusion|Cantrip	CLASSES:Illusionist=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief, then Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create a phantasmal image of a tripwire by forming the thoughts of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: a wire strung in front of its feet. Only the spell's subject can sense the phantasmal tripwire. You see only a vague shape near its feet. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the sensation as unreal. If that save fails, the subject believes the tripwire is real. The subject then must succeed on a second Will save or fall prone and suffer 1d3 nonlethal damage. If the subject of phantasmal tripwire succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy, the image of the tripwire can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to believing that you're caught up in a trip wire upon which you must succeed on a second Will save or fall prone and suffer 1d3 nonlethal damage.
Phantasmal Web	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature/level, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You implant within the minds of your targets the illusion that they are engulfed in tangled webs teeming with swarms of tiny spiders. Those who fail to disbelieve the phantasmal web are treated as if in a web spell, but must also make a Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn or become nauseated for that round by the phantasmal spiders. As the phantasmal web exists only in the minds of the targets, it cannot be burned or destroyed, and it provides no cover (though it does provide concealment) against attacks made by the targets. Targets cannot escape the phantasmal web by moving, even by teleportation. Freedom of movement allows unobstructed movement but does not negate the concealment or nausea effects. Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be engulfed in webs and swarming spiders, but the spell has no visible effect to other creatures (who may assist allies to disbelieve the effect).
Phantom Trap	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Object touched	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time. If another phantom trap is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.

SCHOOL:Healing	CLASSES:White Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:5-ft.-square pillar of positive energy, 20 ft. high	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You conjure a pillar of healing energy in a single 5-foot square within range that radiates light as if it were a torch. Living creatures adjacent to the pillar can spend a standard action to touch the pillar and heal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Creatures can move into the square containing the pillar, but if an undead creature moves into the pillar it takes 1d6 points of holy damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Undead creatures vulnerable to bright light take 1d8 points of holy damage per caster level (maximum 10d8).

SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes and instantaneous (see text)	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create a hideous gray cloud, similar to fog cloud, which occasionally crackles with foul-smelling bolts of sickly green lightning. Creatures in the area must save or contract one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, demon fever, devil chills, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom (the disease is chosen by you when you cast the spell and applies to all creatures that fail the save). The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply) and is an instantaneous effect. Use the disease's listed frequency to determine further effects, but the disease's save DC increases by +2. Unlike a fog cloud, the plague storm moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell. Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the terrain, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. The cloud cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

Illumination conditions are dropped by two steps (though only to darkness, not supernatural darkness), and all creatures in the area take 5d6 points of ice damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage per round. A successful Fortitude save each round negates the Dexterity damage but not the ice damage. Any creature that doesn't move on its turn becomes encased in a sheath of ice equivalent to wall of ice, is helpless, and cannot breathe. Corpses in the area for longer than 1 round are transmuted into solid ice; reviving the icy corpse requires full-life. As a move action, you may move the area of effect up to 10 feet in any direction.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves. This spell does not function underwater.

The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech. You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. See magic mouth for more details about such triggers.

The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action). You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened. If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can't cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image. Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their Will save. You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use a spell or an ability that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of elemental damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged. This spell overlaps (and does not stack with) elemental resistance.

SCHOOL:Enfeebling|Light	CLASSES:Holy Knight=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:No; see text	DESC:This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including illusions). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell Resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell. Each creature with the fire subtype within the area of a quench spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6, no save allowed). Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame. The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a Will save. Artifacts are immune to this effect.
Quick Step	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing	CLASSES:Red Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or until discharged	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell creates a subtle and complicated force effect that is most effective when used by a still or slow-moving spellcaster. While you are subject to this spell, you can take two 5-foot steps each round and still cast spells and use spell-like abilities without provoke attacks of opportunity. This spell automatically discharges as soon as you make an attack, cast a harmful spell against another creature, or move more than 5 feet with a single move action. If the action that discharges the spell also provokes attacks of opportunity, that action still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

Quintessence	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:0 ft.	TARGETAREA:1-inch-diameter dollop of quintessence; see text	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a 1-ounce dollop of thick, gooey material called quintessence. This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent from other viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object. Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms, they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the time stream (the caster is immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round beginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs. Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you do this, there is a 75%% chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.
Rainbow Pattern	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Colorful lights with a 20-ft.-radius spread	DURATION:Concentration + (CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it. Rainbow pattern fascinates a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern. With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked, creatures who can't see them are no longer affected. The spell does not affect sightless creatures.
Raise	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Healing	CLASSES:Necromancer,Red Mage,White Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 full-round action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Dead creature touched	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None; see text	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 round per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised). A spellcasting creature that has a MP pool loses 50%% of its magic points upon being raised. A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell. A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute.

If a creature with spell resistance successfully resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still unable to see within the area of the spell.

When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

Seamantle	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=8	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the seamantle, but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have a swim speed. The cover granted by the seamantle does not enable you to make Stealth checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater. The seamantle blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the seamantle; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes as a bubble of steam contained within the seamantle rather than its usual effect. The seamantle allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as dispel; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you. Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A weapon with a material that deals fire damage that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds.

An undead creature takes 1d6 points of holy damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of holy damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A construct or inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of holy damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6).

Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures. The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures that are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

The illusory summonings created deal four-fifths (80%%) damage to nonbelievers, and non-damaging effects are 80%% likely to work against nonbelievers.
Shadow Anchor	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched; a shadowy shadow tether	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D); see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The target's shadow becomes a flexible tether to its current square. The creature can move up to 5 feet from that square without penalty. Moving farther than 5 feet from the tether point requires the target to make a bull rush combat maneuver check against a CMB of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier. The target takes a -1 penalty for every 5 feet of distance between it and its tethered square. Failing this check means the target's move is wasted and it cannot move farther away. If it fails this check by 10 or more, it is pulled 5 feet toward the tether square and is knocked prone. If it beats the check by 10 or more, the spell ends. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. If the target uses a teleportation effect or leaves the current plane, the spell ends.
Shadow Barbs	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 ft.	TARGETAREA:Spiked chain-like shadowy weapon	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:When you cast this spell, you create a shadowy spiked chain that shimmers and pulses with darkness. The chain exists as long as you carry it; if you ever drop the chain, give it to another, or are disarmed, it immediately vanishes and the spell's duration ends. The chain radiates darkness in a 10-foot-radius spread around you, reducing the illumination level in this area by one step, but not below the level of dim light. You can wield the shadow barbs as a spiked chain as if you were fully proficient with spiked chains. Any additional abilities or feats that you possess that apply to spiked chains apply to the shadow barbs as well. The weapon functions as a +2 vicious spiked chain. Its enhancement bonus increases to +3 at caster level 11th, to +4 at caster level 15th, and finally to +5 at caster level 19th. When the spell effect ends, you can make a Will save against the spell-if successful, all of the damage caused to you by the shadow barbs' vicious weapon quality vanishes, unless you are dead or unconscious at the time the spell ends, in which case you automatically fail this Will save and the vicious weapon damage remains.

Shadow Elemental	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:See text	DURATION:See text	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a black mage or geomancer elemental spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20%% likely to occur. If recognized as a shadow elemental, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow elemental's level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level. Non-damaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.

Shadow Healing	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 hour	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel shadow energy that grants 5d6 temporary hit points + 1 temporary hit point per caster level (maximum +15) though the target and those who observe him believe it has actually healed actual hit point damage. Your touch also casts a shadow over any feelings of irritation and rage the target feels. A target NPC who fail his save has his attitude improved by one-step (to a maximum of helpful). In addition, the target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against illusion spells and effects cast by you for the duration of shadow healing. A successful save results in half healing (or damage if undead) and negates the improvement in attitude and the penalty to saving throws. This spell appears to outside observers and the target as cure III, it also adds your caster level as an insight bonus to the Spellcraft DC; if a creature fails to identify the spell he falsely identifies it as cure III.
Shadow Landscape	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=9	CASTTIME:1 hour	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:One-mile-radius spread centered on a point in space	DURATION:24 hours/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:By infusing the nearby landscape with power stolen from the Plane of Shadow, you make the surrounding terrain a more savage, dangerous place. The spell's exact effects vary with the terrain upon which it is cast. Desert: The spell transforms a desert into a place where no one goes willingly. The average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra. Sandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a shadow landscape desert on an hourly basis. Forest: Forests augmented with a shadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted. Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC). Hill: Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a shadow landscape spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to ascend or descend. Marsh: Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand. Mountain: The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale. Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud noises have a 10%% chance of starting an avalanche. Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet. Plain: Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC). Underground: Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are. Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10%% of the available floor space. In addition to terrain-specific effects, a shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell's area. When rolling random weather, roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground. You don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you created. When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather. You can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level illusionist could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to ice 10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.

Shadow Projection	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is in effect. While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature's create spawn ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice. Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your own. Your shadow projection has the undead type and may be turned or affected as undead. If your shadow projection is slain, you return to your physical body and are immediately reduced to -1 hit points. Your condition becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.

Shadow Summoning	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:See text	DURATION:See text	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with); varies; see text	SPELLRES:Yes; see text	DESC:You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow summoning can mimic any summoner, necromancer, or geomancer summoning spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow summonings are only one-fifth (20%%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow summonings to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a Will save to recognize its true nature. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20%% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow elemental's level (4th) rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any effect created by shadow elemental allows Spell Resistance, even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20%% likely to work. A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20%% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are just one-fifth as large. A creature that succeeds on its save sees the shadow summonings as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their Will saves against this spell.

Shadow Walk	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Up to one touched creature/level	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save). Shadow walk can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50%% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

TARGETAREA:One shadow weapon	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon's attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the shadow weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal. At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the frost or keen weapon property. The frost and keen properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief save. The spell ends if the weapon leaves your possession.

SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You feel a spectral force form near you, as if some intangible shadow being stood nearby. Upon choosing the target of your spell, you sense the shadowy force depart from your side, moving as fast as thought toward the creature you designated as your target. You see the target creature move as if attacked by an unseen foe. Upon casting this spell, you create a shadowy force that automatically grabs the target. The shadowy force immediately attempts to establish a hold on the target with a grapple combat maneuver bonus equal to the DC of this spell. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the grapple combat maneuver bonus of the shadowy grappler is cut in half. Every round on your turn, the shadowy grappler makes a grapple combat maneuver against the target. Once it has a hold, the shadowy force attempts to pin the target on the following round. If the grappler establishes a pin, it uses the option to prevent the target from speaking. The grappler always attempts to maintain a grapple or work toward a pin. A shadowy grappler occupies the same square as the target and moves with the target for as long as the spell lasts. Other creatures cannot join the grapple, either to assist the target or the grappler.

The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage.

SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=8	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:1-mile radius + 1 mile/level	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:As if a massive cloth were sweeping it away, the path before you becomes hidden in shadows and false underbrush. At the same moment, a new path appears from the point you designate, wandering off in a different direction. This spell simultaneously hides a path or road specified by you, while simultaneously creating an illusory path. The illusory path starts at a point chosen by you within the range of the spell. It continues in the direction you indicate, to the limit of the spell's area, where it ends abruptly. The illusory path avoids obstacles and provides no bridges, stairs, ladders, ramps, or other methods of traversing such obstacles. There is no way to force the illusory path to lead over a cliff or across a river more than 4 feet deep. Those who fail their Will saves struggle along the illusory path. If vegetation or rough terrain slows their progress, they believe the path is sloping enough to justify the reduced speed. Those who succeed on their Will saves see both paths, but the illusory path is shadowy and obviously unreal.

The shifting sand obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. Acrobatics checks in the area take a penalty equal to your caster level (maximum +10). Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the shifting sand must make a Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must make a second Reflex save or fall prone. Creatures with the stability racial trait (like dwarves) may apply it as a bonus on their saving throws. As a move action, you may move the area of shifting sand up to 10 feet in any direction. Creatures that are entangled or prone in the spell's area are carried along with the shifting sand in the same direction if possible. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Medium or smaller objects may also be carried along or shallowly buried by the shifting sand.

Simulacrum	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=7	CASTTIME:12 hours	RANGE:0 ft.	TARGETAREA:One duplicate creature	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:Simulacrum creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the real creature's levels or HD (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD). You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check. At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gil per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum. Material Component: This spell requires powdered rubies worth 500 gil per HD of the simulacrum.

When casting this spell, choose one skill. One the round after you cast this spell, you may take 20 on the chosen skill as a single standard action. You only gain this benefit on the skill noted at the time of the spell's casting, gaining no bonus to any other skill.

A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

Slick	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Ice	CLASSES:Black Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature afflicted with Frozen status effect	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex negate	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The target for this spell requires the Frozen status effect to be in effect. Once you cast this spell, the Frozen status effect is removed and a burst of slick ice explodes centered on the target in a 10-ft.-radius burst. Creatures within the area of effect must make a DC 15 Acrobatics check to not fall prone. In addition, the ice hampers the creatures' movements, reducing movement speed by 5 feet until they escape the ice.
Slick II	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Ice	CLASSES:Black Mage=2	DESC:This spell functions like slick, but the area of effect increases to 20-ft.-radius burst and must make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to not fall prone as well as hampering movement by 10 feet.

When moving across level ground, the target's speed increases by 10 feet. If going downhill, speed increases by 20 feet instead, but slipstream provides no movement bonus when going uphill. While swimming, the slipstream increases the target's swim speed by 20 feet-if the target does not have a swim speed, this spell grants a swim speed of 20 ft.

Slow Magic	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=2	DESC:Slow magic is a time mage's version of the dispel magic spell. The spells are identical except where specifically noted. Spells successfully affected by this spell are not dispelled but are instead suppressed for 1d4 + 1 rounds. Magic items and spells with an instantaneous duration are unaffected by slow magic. Slow magic can be used with a counterspell but only against spells with a duration other than instantaneous. The countered spell begins to operate normally after 1d4 + 1 rounds. A suppressed spell can still be detected using detect magic and the time spent suppressed counts against the spell's duration.
Slow Skin	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round / level (D)	DESC:This spell delays the onset of damage. While this spell operates, any damage the caster takes is delayed for a limited number of rounds. The casting level of the spell determines the onset delay. Caster Level Onset Delay 13 - 16 2 rounds 17 - 20 3 rounds 20 + 4 rounds The player should record all damage the character takes in a round as normal but he does not actually remove the hit points until the onset delay has elapsed. Even if the spell is suppressed or dispelled, the damage retains its delay in much the same manner as a fly spell wears off gradually. This spell only affects hit point damage. This spell normally offers no protection against special effects or ability drain, unless the effect would be negated by damage reduction; if so this spell delays the effect until the duration has elapsed. Damage is calculated at the time of the attack or effect. Nothing the character does after that time can change the amount of damage he will take when the onset-delay elapses.

Soften Earth and Stone	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Geomancer=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:10-ft. square/level; see text	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected. A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls (treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see Environment). A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

Solipsism	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Illusionist=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Pangs of loneliness grip your heart as you complete the spell. Upon choosing your target, the feeling subsides even as a ghostly pale yellow mist swirls around your target for a moment. You manipulate the senses of one creature so that it perceives itself to be the only real creature in all of existence and everything around it to be merely an illusion. If the target fails its save, it is convinced of the unreality of every situation it might encounter. It takes no actions, not even purely mental actions, and instead watches the world around it with bemusement. The subject becomes effectively helpless and takes no steps to defend itself from any threat, since it considers any hostile action merely another illusion.
Soul Bind	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enfeebling|Dark	CLASSES:Necromancer=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Corpse	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through raise, arise, arisega, breath of life, or even full-life. Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which is then still dead). The focus for this spell is a black sapphire of at least 1,000 gil value for every HD possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or HD as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched.)

The caster can either expel a 120-ft.-line or a 60-ft.-cone of shrieking black smoke and wind. Any living creature in the area of this attack takes 20d10 points of shadow damage, or half on a successful Reflex save.

Spark	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Lightning	CLASSES:Black Mage=1	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature afflicted with Static status effect	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The target for this spell requires the Static status effect to be in effect. Once you cast this spell, the Static status effect is removed and a blast of lightning bursts from the target. The blast deals lightning damage equal to your caster level (maximum 5) plus your Intelligence modifier to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 5). The secondary blasts each strike one target and deal half as much lightning damage as the primary bolt. Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The Reflex DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 10 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.
Spark II	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Spectral Hand	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Dark	CLASSES:Necromancer=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One spectral hand	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the spectral hand. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if it goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers. The hand is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed Reflex save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an AC of 22 (+8 size, +4 natural armor). Your Charisma modifier applies to the hand's AC as if it were the hand's Dexterity modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.

SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One creature/level	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D); see text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A touch from your hand, which crackles with black energy, weakens the life force of living creatures. Each melee touch attack you successfully make during the spell's duration channels negative energy that bestows one negative level on the target and grants you 5 temporary hit points. This spell cannot give you more temporary hit points than your normal starting hit points (your hit point total cannot exceed two times your normal starting hit points). Both the negative level and the temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour. You can use this attack once per round for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. Any charges of the spell not used by the time the duration expires are lost. An undead creature you touch instead gains 5 temporary hit points and you lose a like amount (no save). Temporary hit points gained in this way last for up to 1 hour.
Spike Stones	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing	CLASSES:Geomancer=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One 20-ft. square/level	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours (D)	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background. Spike stones impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area. Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.

The caster calls forth up to six longsword-shaped force effects that float near the caster until directed. The caster can use a standard action to direct one blade to attack a target up to a distance of 50 feet away, or use a full-attack action to cause all six blades to attack up to six different targets up to a distance of 50 feet away, each to a different location if desired. Once the caster directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the caster's turn until directed otherwise by the caster and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the caster. As a move action, the caster can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the caster's base attack bonus modified by its Intelligence modifier, and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the caster's Intelligence modifier. Physical attacks do not affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the caster does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes. Likewise, any blades that are not within 50 feet of the caster at the end of its turn also vanish.

Symbol of Death	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=8	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0 ft.; see text	TARGETAREA:One symbol	DURATION:See text	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a symbol of death kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The symbol of death affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again. Until it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. As a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a symbol of death's triggering conditions cannot be changed. In this case, �reading� the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify. When scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again. You also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them. Read magic allows you to identify a symbol with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the symbol's spell level). Of course, if the symbol is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol. A symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel targeted solely on the rune. Destruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.

The weapon gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no Saving Throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.
Temporal Acceleration	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round (in apparent time); see text	DESC:You enter another time frame, speeding up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at normal speed. You are free to act for 1 round of apparent time. You can cast spells, move, or perform other types of actions, subject to the restrictions outlined below. While your temporal acceleration is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells. This means you cannot target a creature with any attack or spell. However, a spell you cast that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of your temporal acceleration has its normal effect on creatures in the area once this spell ends. You can affect an unattended object but not an object held, carried, or worn by another creature. You are undetectable by any means while your temporal acceleration lasts. While under the effect of this spell, you cannot enter an area protected by a null magic field or by a spell that neutralizes high-level spells. Normal and magical fire, ice, acid, and the like can still harm you. When your temporal acceleration expires, you resume acting during your current turn in the standard time frame. You are shaken for 1 round upon your return to the standard time frame.

The creature suffers a -2 penalty to his AC, attack rolls and saving throws, is considered to be flat-footed at all times and suffers a 20%% miss chance on all his attacks. Targeted spells suffer a 50%% chance of failure but area effect spells can be cast normally. This spell may be removed with a successful dispel but it is otherwise permanent.

Temporal Jolt	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Ray	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A colorless beam streaks toward your target, violently throwing the target back and forth in time, aging natural materials and damaging the brittle remains. The ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of non-elemental damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d6). In addition, the beam speeds the decay or corrosion of nonmagical items, aging them hundreds of years in a single moment. Nonmagical armor worn by an affected target permanently loses 1d6 points of Armor Class (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered) and nonmagical weapons and items being held are instantly destroyed (items in backpacks, pouches, and other containers are unaffected). Armor that has its armor bonus reduced to 0 is destroyed. Magic items are unaffected by this spell.
Temporal Reiteration	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:A temporal fire encompasses your body. Within its time-defying flames, you gain a moment of stasis. The past round does not count as time spent from the duration of ongoing effects on you such as rage, spell duration, and poison. Casting this spell effectively increases their duration for you by 1 round.

Any time altering spell of lower level than temporal repair cannot affect creatures within its area of effect. If the target of a time-altering effect that lasts for multiple rounds enters temporal repair's area of effect, that spell is dispelled. For spells of a higher level than temporal repair, you must make a caster level check against the opposing caster. If you fail, your opponent's time- altering spell proves stronger than your temporal repair and it functions normally. If you succeed, your opponent's time-altering spell is dispelled.

Temporal Stasis	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=8	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject into a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow, and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state persists until the magic is removed (such as by a successful dispel spell or a freedom of movement spell).
Temporary Resurrection	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=7	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Dead creature touched	DURATION:24 hours	DESC:You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with raise). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a white mage can cast raise or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with temporary resurrection, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.

Threefold Aspect	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:24 hours (D)	DESC:Threefold aspect allows you to shift your appearance between your natural age and three idealized age categories: young adult (youth/maiden), adulthood (father/mother), or elderly (elder/crone). In each case, your appearance is your own at the appropriate age, rather than that of a new individual. You may change between these three aspects or your actual age as a standard action. As the young adult, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, but suffer a -2 penalty to Wisdom. In the adult aspect, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a -2 penalty to Dexterity. As the elderly aspect, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Intelligence, but take a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. As enhancement bonuses, these stack with any bonuses or penalties you may have from your actual age (which are untyped bonuses)-the bonuses granted by this spell represent your idealized form in this threefold aspect rather than simply duplicating your ability scores at any one particular age. True seeing reveals your natural appearance overlaid with that your aspect, recognizing both as part of your true self. Individuals who study you closely and have interacted with you at another apparent age recognize a resemblance (as though family) with a successful DC 20 Perception check. Threefold aspect does not alter your clothing or equipment, and does not heal any deformity or injury unrelated to age.

Requires a ranged touch attack roll to hit that deals 1d6 points of lightning damage + your casting modifier (Intelligence or Charisma) + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5) and inflicts the Static status effect for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save prevents the status effect from taking effect.

Timeless Body	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Timer	SOURCEPAGE:p.

You choose what type of alarm sound timer creates during casting and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. Anyone within the area will hear the alarm sound clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the alarm.
Time Regression	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:You can regress apparent time 1 round into the past. In effect, you �replay� the previous round of activity. The spell regresses time to the point along the time stream just prior to your previous turn, undoing the effects of everyone else's actions in the meantime. Once you have used time regression, only you retain knowledge of what happened during the round that is being replayed; however, you can communicate that knowledge verbally to your companions, if desired. During the round that you live through a second time, you can act on knowledge you previously gained by already living through the immediate future. In all likelihood, you'll probably not choose to cast time regression during your second pass through the time stream, instead taking completely new actions. Altering the time stream in such a fashion is mentally taxing and you suffer 2 points of ability damage to Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom. This damage cannot be ignored through any special effects or abilities, but can be healed as any other ability damage.
# 780 of 907
Time Shield	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius sphere centered on you	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create a bubble of magically enhanced time that consumes spells at a quickened rate. Upon casting this spell, all spells and spell effects within the time shield have their durations consumed at time their normal rate. Any spell with a duration measured in rounds or minutes, whether beneficial or harmful, is affected (spells measured in hours, days, or longer are shortened imperceptibly). Creatures affected by spells cast outside a time shield that enter the time shield have their spells consumed at the increased rate. Upon leaving the time shield, the creature's spells again decrease at their normal rate. Even spending only a portion a round within a time shield causes spells to expire at an accelerated rate. Thus, if a creature begins and ends its turn outside a time shield but passes through the area of effect in the interim, any spells that affect the creature lose 2 rounds of duration that round. A time shield cannot affect another time shield, thus the spell has no effect on other instances of this spell.
Time Spellsurge	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	DESC:Green and yellow sparks fly off your body as a light breeze picks up, lifting loose debris and swirling around with a faint howl. This spell speeds the flow of magic through you, hastening your spellcasting ability. Casting times for chronomancy spells are reduced as follows: Normal Casting Time New Casting Time 1 standard action 1 swift action 1 full round 1 standard action 2-10 rounds 1 round less than normal Time spellsurge has no effect on any spell with a casting time of greater than 1 minute or a casting time not listed on the table. You can't choose to ignore this effect; that is, you can't opt to cast a spell using its normal casting time. Thus, if all your spells normally have casting times of 1 standard action, they take 1 swift action instead, and because you can't take more than one swift action in a round, you won't be able to cast multiple spells per round while under the effect of time spellsurge. (If you have available spells with casting times of 1 full round, you are still able to cast more than one of those spells per round). This spell doesn't stack with any other effect that reduces a spell's casting time.

Time Stop	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=9	DURATION:1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text	DESC:This spell functions as lesser time stop except you are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time instead.
Time Stop, Lesser	KEY:Time Stop (Lesser)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=7	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round (apparent time); see text	DESC:This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1 round of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, ice, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the lesser time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the lesser time stop have their normal effects on other creatures once the lesser time stop ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat. You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession.
Time to Act	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:Time to act gives you the time to perform a single skill check. The skill check must be an actual action, you must have at least one rank in the skill; all necessary equipment must be on your person and ready to use. Skill checks that require extensive time or bulk materials cannot be used with this spell. The skill check cannot be a reaction to outside actions or the actions of others. During the action, you cannot move from your current position but you can perform any other physical aspects of the skill use. You cannot make use of any spell, supernatural or even extraordinary ability-related skill check. To others you seem to blur and then the action is complete.
Time to Act, Greater	KEY:Time to Act (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=8	DESC:This spell is the same as time to act except that it gives the caster sufficient time to Take 20 on his check. He may still only make one skill check, and the caster must still abide by all the restrictions of the lesser spell.
# 782 of 907

Time Walk	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=9	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Personal and touch	TARGETAREA:The character and touched objects or other touched willing creatures weighing up to 50 lb./level	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None and Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:No and Yes (object)	DESC:A far more powerful version of the bend space and time spell, this spell instantly transports the character to the same location, but to a different time. Interplanar travel is not possible, and the spell fails on any plane where time is meaningless. The character can bring along objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 pounds per caster level. Unwilling creatures cannot be affected by this spell. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. To cast this spell, the character must be able to state the arrival time accurately, down to the minute. The spell never transports the caster and companions to the precise minute desired, but it cannot function at all without a specific minute in time to target. This "drift" effect of not arriving at the precise time desired grows with the "distance" through time (measured in years, months, and weeks) traveled. Thus, a caster teleporting to last month arrives closer to her goal than one traveling 250 years. The minimum temporal distance traveled is 1 day, so this spell is not useful for going back to the beginning of a melee that is still progressing. This spell requires some knowledge of the destination time, so it cannot transport anyone into the future since the future is entirely unknown to the caster. Even spells that give knowledge of the future cannot give definite enough knowledge to allow this spell to work. It is possible to use this spell to travel forward in time, but only to the point in the caster's life when the caster first went back in time. Since the caster may not know exactly what is transpiring at the destination time, prudent time-travelers prepare for the worst. The errors in arrival for this spell occur in time rather than in location, since the character does not change locations at all. To see how closely the character arrives to the planned arrival time, consult this table. Temporal Distance Traveled Temporal Drift* Chance of Mishap 1 day to 1 month +/- d8 minutes 5%% 1 month to 1 year +/- d8 hours 7%% 1 year to 10 years +/- d20 hours 10%% 10 years to 100 years +/- d8 days 15%% 100 years to 1,000 years +/- d20 days 20%% 1,000 years + +/- d20 months 25%% * There is a 50%% chance that the number is a negative number. Add or subtract the temporal drift to the destination time to determine the exact time of arrival. Mishaps result in the spell failing and the character taking 1 point of Intelligence damage for every 10 years of expected time travel due to the mental bombardment that time travel brings with it. Thus, a character trying to transport through 100 years would take 10 points of Intelligence damage. Intelligence can be reduced to 0 through this damage (but not lower). In the case that a traveler meets himself, the two travelers instantly lose control and attack each other with every ability and item at their disposal. However, should a traveler die while traveling in the past, the traveler's body immediately vanishes from the point of time it traveled to and returns to the point where the spell was cast at the time that the spell was cast. In other words, if a traveler perishes in a fire, the instant that the traveler died in that fire is the instant in which the traveler is no longer in that time period, and the body is never found within that location since it returns to the moment of time in which the traveler finished the spell and began time traveling.

The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don't speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way.

In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. You can only have one light spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. Light can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.

For the duration of this spell, when the caster hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon, the target must make a Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When the caster strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind.
Touch of Fatigue	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Dark|Cantrip	CLASSES:Black Mage,Necromancer=0	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You channel dark energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target. The subject is immediately fatigued for the spell's duration. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued. Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.

Touch of Years	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Chronomancy	CLASSES:Time Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Living creature touched	DURATION:1 day/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:With a touch, your foe becomes visibly enfeebled, as if a sudden weight of years had dropped onto his shoulders. Your touch deals 3 points of drain to the subject's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores; a successful Fortitude save negates this effect and prevents any further harm. If the subject fails its initial saving throw, it takes another 3 points of drain to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores each day thereafter as long as the spell lasts. A successful Fortitude save negates this drain, but doesn't end the spell's duration. The ability drain from this spell can be eliminated as normal, but doing this doesn't end the spell's duration. If you cast this spell on a creature while another casting of touch of years is already in effect on it, the second spell doesn't deal ability drain. Instead, a failed initial Fortitude save renders the creature permanently deafened and blinded. These conditions can be removed by normal means (such as esuna), but doing this has no effect on the ability drain. This spell can't be dispelled, but any effect that would remove a curse allows the spellcaster a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level) to end the spell's duration. This doesn't restore any ability score points already lost.

Transmute Mud to Rock	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Geomancer=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell permanently transforms normal mud or quicksand of any depth into soft stone (sandstone or a similar mineral). Any creature in the mud is allowed a Reflex save to escape before the area is hardened to stone. Transmute mud to rock counters and dispels transmute rock to mud.
Transmute Rock to Mud	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Geomancer=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet. If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves. Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell. The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage. Transmute rock to mud counters and dispels transmute mud to rock.

True Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.

Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.
Tsunami	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Water	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-deep wave 10 ft. wide/level and 2 ft. tall/level	DURATION:5 rounds	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create a massive wave of water that then moves in a straight line across water or land-you select the direction the wave travels (which must be perpendicular to its width), but once set in motion, the wave cannot change course. Over the surface of open water, the wave travels at a speed of 60 feet per round-on land or underwater, the wave travels at a speed of 30 feet per round. Creatures struck by a tsunami take 8d6 points of water damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage). In addition, the tsunami makes a special Attack roll against any creature it strikes, the wave's Attack roll is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence modifier + 8 (for the wave's size). The defender makes an opposed Strength check, if the defender fails, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a Swim check opposed by the wave's Attack roll, if a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of water damage (Fortitude save for half) and continues being carried along by the wave. Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave's journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of water damage when a tsunami passes through its space, if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.

The undead bursts into blue flames that do not burn. The subject creature deals an extra 2d6 points of damage on melee attacks against living creatures. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the undead subject attacks it. If your caster level check fails, the creature is unaffected by that casting of the undead torch. If the undead creature is destroyed, the undead torch continues to burn at the location of its destruction until the duration ends, and living creatures that pass through that area take 2d6 points of damage. If the undead creature assumes a nonphysical state (such as a vampire assuming gaseous form), the spell disperses harmlessly.

Each touch channels dark energy that deals 1d6 points of shadow damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level. An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

The caster can create a nimbus of unholy light, causing nauseating beams of writhing color to play around his body. One round later, the light bursts in a 60-foot radius. Any non-demon creature caught within this area must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of madness hound it. The caster is immune to this effect.
Unholy Sword	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Dark	CLASSES:Dark Knight=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Melee weapon touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell allows you to channel the powers of evil into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 unholy weapon (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against good opponents). It also emits a magic circle against good effect (as the spell). If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one unholy sword at a time. If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with any spells that modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with this spell's enhancement bonus to attack.
Unwilling Shield	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Necromancer=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Like shield other, unwilling shield creates a mystic connection between you and the target, but unlike shield other, the target shares the wounds that you receive. In addition, the link draws upon the target's life force to supplement your own defenses. You gain a +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. You take only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by the target. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, ability damage, level draining, and death effects are not affected. If you take a reduction in hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the target because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subject, but damage already split is not assigned to you. If you and the target of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell remains active, but damage is no longer shared until you are once again within range of each other.

Your touch deals 1d6 points of shadow damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the subject's current hit points + the subject's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.
Vanish	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Dark Knight=2|Black Mage,Illusionist,Red Mage,White Mage=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal or touch	TARGETAREA:You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless) or yes (harmless, object)	DESC:The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

Upon releasing the spell's energy on your desired subject, your senses clear, although the spell's recipient can no longer be perceived. This powerful illusion functions like vanish, except that it masks image, scent, and sound alike, concealing the subject from all senses except touch. As with greater vanish, this spell doesn't end if the subject attacks. While invisible, the subject exudes no scent and is undetectable by scent, blindsense, tremorsense, and blindsight. Superior vanish renders the recipient immune to detection by see invisibility, faerie fire, glitterdust, invisibility purge, and dust of appearance, although creatures under the effect of the spell can be detected by true seeing. Certain mundane conditions (such as leaving footprints) can also render a subject detectable.

You can make the subjects appear to be anything you wish. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check. Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or with Spell Resistance. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief saves to see through the illusion, but Spell Resistance doesn't help.
Veil of Undeath	SOURCEPAGE:p.

You gain many of the traits common to undead creatures. While the spell lasts, you have immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death, nonlethal damage, death from massive damage, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, damage to physical ability scores, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it is harmless or affects objects. You need not breathe, eat, or sleep. You don't actually gain the undead type from casting this spell.

Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first, and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become sickened by the distortion, creatures that move more than half their speed must make an additional Will save or fall prone.

You may direct the whirlpool to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish. A boat that is equal in length or shorter than the vortex's width that passes through a vortex takes 6d6 points of water damage and is caught up by the current. If the boat's captain makes a DC 25 Profession (sailor) check (or if the boat is longer than the vortex's width), the boat takes only half damage and is not caught up by the vortex.

SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Fire	CLASSES:Black Mage=4|Geomancer=5	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Opaque sheet of flame up to 20 ft. long/level or a ring of fire with a radius of up to 5 ft./two levels; either form 20 ft. high	DURATION:Concentration + (CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on your turn each round. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points or more of cold damage in 1 round, that length goes away. (Do not divide cold damage by 2, as normal for objects.)

Wall of Lava	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth|Fire	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer=8	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Lava wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell creates a vertical wall of lava that is 1 inch thick for every 4 caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. A wall of lava's maximum height cannot exceed half of its width (with a minimum height of 5 feet). The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or object. A section of a wall of lava can be destroyed by damage (hardness 4, hp 90), but if a section is destroyed, the remaining lava in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 5-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. Each time a weapon strikes a wall of lava, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage (or the creature who strikes the wall takes 2d6 points of fire damage if the attack was via an unarmed strike or natural attack). A creature can move through a wall of lava as a full-round action by making a DC 25 Strength check-failure indicates that the creature is pushed back out of the wall to the point he just attempted to leave. A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a wall of lava inflicts 20d6 points of fire damage. A wall of lava also radiates heat as if it were a wall of fire, although the heat from a wall of lava radiates from both sides. Once per round as a move action, you can direct the wall of lava to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall's overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a wall of lava from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall. All damage inflicted by physical contact with a wall of lava continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).

Wall of Stone	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Black Mage,White Mage=5|Geomancer=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Stone wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This spell creates a wall of rocks that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. You can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.
Wandering Star Motes	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Illusion|Light	CLASSES:Illusionist=4	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One living creature and special; see text	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create sparkling motes of bright light that shoot toward the target and swirl around it in a complex pattern. The pattern clearly outlines the target and radiates light as if it were a sunrod, negating any concealment for the target. The target must make a successful Will save. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will save, the wandering star motes jump to the nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the wandering star motes jump to the next nearest enemy within 30 feet. A given creature can only be affected by the wandering star motes once; once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures; your allies are not affected.

You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush combat maneuver against any one creature or object. Your CMB roll for this combat maneuver is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Water blast extinguishes any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected.

Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjects' feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it. The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground. If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.

SCHOOL:Enhancing|Light	CLASSES:Holy Knight=2	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Weapon touched	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	DESC:You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no Saving Throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.

You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.) Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of wind damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of wind damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

Whispering Wind	SOURCEPAGE:p.

The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. Whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Unlike mundane armor, wind armor entails no armor check penalty, spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since wind armor is made of wind, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for whom the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20%% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.
Wind Walk	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=6	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:You and one touched creature per three levels	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours (D); see text	SAVEINFO:None and Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:No and yes (harmless)	DESC:You alter the substance of your body to a cloud-like vapor and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80%% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.
Wind Wall	SOURCEPAGE:p.

It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A Reflex save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30%% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures). While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points.

SCHOOL:Enhancing|Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Wind	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You surround yourself with a buffeting shroud of supernatural, tornado-force winds. These winds grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. Neither your armor nor your load affects this fly speed. The winds shield you from any other wind effects, and form a shell of breathable air around you, allowing you to fly and breathe underwater or in outer space. Ranged weapons (including giant-thrown boulders, siege weapon projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons) passing through the winds are deflected by the winds and automatically miss you. Gases and most gaseous breath weapons cannot pass though the winds. In addition, when a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can shape your winds so they lash out at that creature as an immediate action. The creature must make a Fortitude Saving Throw or take 5d8 points of wind damage and be knocked prone (if on the ground). On a failed save, Huge flying creatures are checked and Large-sized or smaller flying creatures are blown away instead of knocked prone. On a successful save, the damage is halved and the creature is not knocked prone (or checked or blown away).

World Wave	SOURCEPAGE:p.	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth|Water	CLASSES:Black Mage,Geomancer,White Mage=9	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:See text	TARGETAREA:See text	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds or (CASTERLEVEL) hours; see text (D)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You cause any sort of natural terrain (including water, forest, desert, tundra, and so on) to surge beneath your feet and safely propel you with devastating force over great distances. This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave. When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of earth damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of earth damage (if the swell). The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one geomancer class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion. The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that. The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city). You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table: Summon Monster. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.

Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table: Summon Monster marked with an "*" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an "*" always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.

Frozen Note	SOURCEPAGE:p.843	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=5	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	SAVEINFO:Will partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You produce and sustain a single perfect musical note that holds nearby creatures, friend as well as foe, utterly spellbound until you stop singing. Affected creatures are both paralyzed and oblivious to their surroundings so long as you maintain the note. Maintaining this note requires your absolute attention; if you take damage or take any other action, including moving from your current square, the song instantly ends. Creatures that succeed in their initial Saving Throw must make a new one for each round they spend within the area of the song until they fail and become captivated. Creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice greater than your caster level are not affected by this song. However, those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive a Saving Throw to resist it. The note is so clear and flawless that less than extraordinary attempts to avoid hearing it merely grant targets a bonus on their saving throws. Targets get a +2 circumstance bonus on their Saving Throw for each barrier between your voice and their ears. This includes such things as a creature stopping up its ears with wax, closing all windows and doors in a nearby building, or even crawling into a barrel and pulling down the top. If a target that had previously made its Saving Throw loses the benefit of one or more of its barriers it must immediately make a new Saving Throw. Similarly, any target that had previously failed its Saving Throw gets a new save each time it gains the protection of a barrier.
Fugue	SOURCEPAGE:p.844	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=5	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius spread	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Creatures that fail their save become affected by the haunting fugue in semi-random ways. On each affected creature's turn (as long as it remains in the affected area), you make a Perform check. The check result determines how the victim's mind and body are affected by the song. You can select any of the effects for which your Perform check equals or exceeds the required DC.	DESC:&nl;DC Result	DESC:&nl;15 Victim takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage	DESC:&nl;20 Victim takes 3d6 points of sonic damage	DESC:&nl;25 Victim is knocked prone	DESC:&nl;30 Victim is nauseated for 1 round	DESC:&nl;35 Victim is stunned for 1 round	DESC:&nl;40 Victim attacks nearest target	DESC:&nl;All creatures that succeed on their saves against the song are disoriented and take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks as long as they remain in the affected area.

Ghostharp	SOURCEPAGE:p.845	SCHOOL:Summoning|Jingle	CLASSES:Bard=0	DESC:You prepare an object that records and replays a song previously played or sung in its vicinity. When performed, the song searches a radius of 50 feet for the lingering notes of a tune played there within the last day. It records these notes and reverberations. At your verbal command, �Play,� the ghostharp replays the music. The tune repeats until you command it to stop, or until its duration comes to an end. The ghostharp does not record conversations. Its imperfect replay can't reproduce bardic music or other magical effects, nor can it perform bard songs.
Ghost Sound	SOURCEPAGE:p.845	SCHOOL:Illusion|Jingle	CLASSES:Bard=0	TARGETAREA:Illusory sounds	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief	SPELLRES:No	DESC:Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when performing it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humes per caster level (maximum 40 humes). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humes running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humes, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humes. Anyone who hears a ghost sound receives a Will save to disbelieve.

A mantle of sweet tones settles about your subject, whose face is now twisted in concentration. Harmonic chorus lets you improve the spellcasting ability of a spellcaster. For the duration of the song, the subject gains a +2 morale bonus to caster level and a +2 morale bonus on save DCs for all spells it casts.
Haunting Choir	SOURCEPAGE:p.846	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Bard=3	RANGE:30 feet	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius emanation	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create a spectral choir and conduct its tortured, ghostly moans, deluding listeners into believing they are suffering the torments of the dead. The transparent singers occupy a 10-foot cube, but they are intangible and do not interfere with creatures in any physical way, nor can they be attacked. Creatures within 30 feet of the choir experience wracking pain that causes them to take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Individuals who exit the area of effect take these penalties for an additional 2 rounds before the delusion wears off.
Haunting Tune	SOURCEPAGE:p.847	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=3	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The effect wrapped within your music makes even the most hard-hearted quail. Targets that fail their saves become shaken.

Hideous Laughter	SOURCEPAGE:p.847	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=1	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This song afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the song ends, it can act normally. On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for the entire duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the bard's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't "translate" well.
Horde Lullaby	SOURCEPAGE:p.848	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=4	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This song functions like Foe Lullaby, except it affects all enemies within 30 feet of the bard.

Insidious Rhythm	SOURCEPAGE:p.848	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=1	TARGETAREA:One creature	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The subject takes a -4 penalty on Intelligence-based skill checks and Concentration checks due to an endlessly recycling melody stuck in its mind. Whenever the subject attempts to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check (DC equal to insidious rhythm's save DC + spell's level) or fail at the attempt.
Inspirational Boost	SOURCEPAGE:p.849	SCHOOL:Enhancing	CLASSES:Bard=1	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DESC:As you finish, the song's chant allows you to segue easily into bolstering your allies. While this spell is in effect, the morale bonus granted by your inspire courage bardic music increases by 1. The effect lasts until your inspire courage effect ends or this song ends, whichever comes first. If you don't begin to use your inspire courage ability before the beginning of your next turn, the song's effect ends.
Irresistible Dance	SOURCEPAGE:p.849	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=5	RANGE:30 feet	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The song effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and a -10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any Armor Class bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn.
Joyful Noise	SOURCEPAGE:p.849	SCHOOL:Elemental	DESCRIPTOR:Earth	CLASSES:Bard=1	RANGE:10 ft.	TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you	DESC:You create sonic vibrations that negate any magical silence effect in the area.

All creatures that begin their turn within the area of this song's effect gain fast healing 5, resistance 10 to all elemental types, and a +3 sacred bonus on all saving throws against poison and disease. Any creature that enters the area of effect does not gain the benefits of the music of the spheres until it begins its turn in that area.
Nixie's Lure	SOURCEPAGE:p.852	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=3	TARGETAREA:All creatures within a 30-ft.-radius burst centered on you	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:This creates an unearthly and infectious song that seductively summons all who hear it. Nixie's lure affects a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures in the area who fail their saves are lured by the song and move toward you using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures each receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Creatures lured by the song can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of you simply stands still and for the duration of the song remains fascinated.
Pied Piping	SOURCEPAGE:p.852	SCHOOL:Enfeebling	CLASSES:Bard=5	TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you	SAVEINFO:Will partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You call forth a melody so compelling and attractive that creatures belonging to a group with a specific, identifiable physical trait (such as type, subtype, age, gender, or hair color) find it almost impossible not to approach and follow you. You choose the nature of the creatures you seek to attract when you perform this song and, once you make this choice, cannot alter it. You can only use physical traits to determine your audience. You can never use social and other more voluntary criteria (such as alignment, religion, nationality, or class) to select targets for this spell. Eligible creatures must make a Saving Throw each round spent within the area of the song and, once they fail, approach you at their normal movement speed and stand as close to you as possible without actually entering an occupied square. If you move, they do their best to maintain their proximity to you and follow. Affected creatures can take no actions other than listening to your music and following you if you move. Those entering the area while the song is in effect must also successfully save or be compelled to come to you. The attractive power of the song does not cause affected creatures to put themselves in jeopardy and they have enough presence of mind to avoid or negotiate around obstacles and other perilous hazards. If unable to approach or follow you without endangering themselves, they simply wait, swaying to the music, until you pass out of range, at which point they regain their senses. If circumstances change once you move out of range, making it possible for affected creatures to resume their attempts to get near you they do so, and, if they manage to return to within the area of the song before it wears off, the song continues as normal. If attacked, affected creatures can take defensive measures, even going so far as to avoid existing threats by moving out of the area of the song, but cannot make attacks themselves or take any other actions until the effects of the song wear off.

Shadowbard	SOURCEPAGE:p.855	SCHOOL:Illusion	CLASSES:Bard=5	TARGETAREA:Phantom singer	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You conjure up a quasi-real phantom singer that is visible as a shifting, shadowy duplicate of yourself. The singer follows you automatically, moving as you move even if you teleport. The singer cannot be damaged, but can be dispelled. When a shadowbard comes into being, it immediately begins a bardic performance of your choice-it has access to all of the bardic performances that you do. It continues that bardic performance until you direct it as a move action to switch to a different performance. Rounds spent by a shadowbard creating a bardic performance do not decrease the number of rounds you can use your own bardic performance, nor can a shadowbard's bardic performance be used to trigger songs that require you to begin or cease a bardic performance.

Solid Note	SOURCEPAGE:p.857	SCHOOL:Summoning	CLASSES:Bard=1	TARGETAREA:One solidified musical note	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You give temporary physical form to a single musical note and can hang it, suspended, wherever you wish within range, allowing you to use it as hook, pulley, door blocker, or anything else your imagination desires. The exact appearance of the solid note depends on your melody. You can make it spiked or smooth, simple or convoluted, and with any color pattern you wish, however, it always has a size approximately equal to that of your outstretched hand. Once created, the solid note resists all attempts to move it but instantly disappears if enough force or weight is brought to bear against it. The note has an effective Strength equal to 10 + your caster level. It cannot hold more weight than the equivalent of a heavy load for its Strength without disappearing. Any creature that wins an opposed Strength check against the note (by pushing open a door which the note is holding shut for example) also causes it to disappear. The note can never deal actual harm to a creature and disappears if successfully attacked (AC 10 + your Charisma modifier) or overcome with a combat maneuver such as bull rush (CMD 2 + your base attack bonus + your Charisma modifier). Any creature obstructed by the solid note simply fails to budge it and loses that action for the round.
