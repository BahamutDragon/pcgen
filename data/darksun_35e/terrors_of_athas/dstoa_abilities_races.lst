This entire process takes six minutes, one minute for the flesh to numb and another five minutes for the egg to be deposited in the host.

The egg grows for four days, dealing 1 point of temporary Constitution damage to its host each day. A Heal or Search check (DC 20) locates a raised, red welt over the growing larva. Cutting the larva out deals the host 1d4 points of damage. If not removed, the egg bursts free after the fourth day, and a noncombatant sandcrawler young drops off and burrows into the sand.
