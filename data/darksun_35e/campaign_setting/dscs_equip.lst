The quabone is often used in the arenas. The wounds it inflicts are nonlethal, yet have entertainment value, as the quabone tends to open up many small cuts that bleed freely-for a brief time.

The surface of most pelota is studded with obsidian shards. You can use the dejada throwing glove to cast pelota at much higher speed and with greater accuracy, dealing more damage than a pelota thrown by hand.

Forearm Axe								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Forearm Axe		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Light.Slashing														COST:30	WT:6					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:Strapped to the forearm like a buckler, the forearm axe resembles a double-headed battleaxe, with the wearer's arm serving as the haft of the axe. You may continue to use your hand normally, but you cannot attack with the forearm axe and a wielded weapon in the same hand in one round. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of a forearm axe.
Macahuitl, Small		KEY:Macahuitl (Small)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Macahuitl			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Light.Slashing														COST:20	WT:2					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:A macahuitl is a sword painstakingly crafted using a core of solid wood, with small, sharp shards of obsidian embedded into the wood to form an edge on two opposite sides of the weapon. These weapons are swung like the scimitar, though macahuitls tend to require more maintenance. The macahuitl is especially popular among the Draji, who seem to be the only ones who can easily pronounce this weapon's Draji name ("ma-ka-wheet-luh"). Non-Draji simply refer to it as the "obsidian sword" or the "Draji sword."
Slodak								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Slodak			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Light.Slashing														COST:18	WT:4					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:The slodak is a wooden short sword, carved from young hardwood trees and treated with a mixture of tree sap and id fiend blood. This treatment renders the blade of the weapon extremely strong, making it a deadly weapon.
Tortoise Blade							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tortoise Blade		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Light.Piercing														COST:20	WT:2					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:The tortoise blade consists of a footlong dagger mounted to the center of a shell. The tortoise blade is strapped over the wearer's hand, preventing them from holding anything but the tortoise blade. The tortoise blade also functions as a buckler, granting a +1 armor bonus, inflicting a -1 armor check penalty and incurring a 5% arcane spell failure chance. A masterwork tortoise blade either functions as a masterwork shield or a masterwork weapon (or both, for twice the normal masterwork cost).

Alak									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Alak				TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.OneHanded.Piercing													COST:7	WT:6					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:An alak consists of a 2-foot long shaft of bone or wood, with four serrated bones tied to the sharp end, like the four prongs of a grappling hook. When using an alak, add a +2 bonus on the opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if you fail to disarm your opponent).
Alhulak								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Alhulak			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.OneHanded.Piercing													COST:40	WT:9					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:The alhulak consists of an alak tied to a 5- foot long leather cord, which wraps around your wrist at the other end. An alhulak has reach. You can strike opponents 10 ft. away with it. In addition, you can use it against an adjacent foe. When using an alhulak, add a +2 bonus on the opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if the character fails to disarm his or her opponent).
Carrikal								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Carrikal			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.OneHanded.Slashing													COST:10	WT:6					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:The sharpened jawbone of a large creature is lashed to a haft. The jagged edges are sharpened, forming a sort of battleaxe with two forward-facing heads.
Impaler								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Impaler			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.OneHanded.Piercing													COST:8	WT:5					CRITMULT:x4			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:Like many Athasian weapons, the impaler was developed for the arenas. Two blades are mounted parallel to the end of a four-foot long shaft, forming a bladed 'T'. The impaler is swung horizontally or vertically with great force.
Macahuitl								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Macahuitl			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.OneHanded.Slashing													COST:35	WT:5					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2												DAMAGE:1d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:A macahuitl is a sword painstakingly crafted using a core of solid wood, with small, sharp shards of obsidian embedded into the wood to form an edge on two opposite sides of the weapon. These weapons are swung like the scimitar, though macahuitls tend to require more maintenance. The macahuitl is especially popular among the Draji, who seem to be the only ones who can easily pronounce this weapon's Draji name ("ma-ka-wheet-luh"). Non-Draji simply refer to it as the "obsidian sword" or the "Draji sword."

Crusher, Fixed		KEY:Crusher (Fixed)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Crusher (Fixed)		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning													COST:60	WT:12					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:The crusher is made from a large stone or metal weight, mounted at the end of a 15-foot long shaft of springy wood. The weight is whipped back and forth. The crusher is a reach weapon. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you cannot use it against an adjacent foe. You need a 15-foot ceiling to use the weapon, but it can reach over cover. Crushers come in two varieties, fixed and free. A fixed crusher requires a base to use. The fixed crusher's base is enormously heavy, usually consisting of a thick slab of stone with a hole drilled through it to support the crusher's pole. The base is transported separately from the pole, and it takes one full minute to set the fixed crusher up for battle. The fixed crusher is a martial weapon, finding most use in infantry units. It is possible to use the crusher pole without the base as a free crusher, but this requires considerable expertise. You need an exotic weapon proficiency in the free crusher to accomplish this feat without the -4 proficiency penalty, even if you are proficient in the fixed crusher.
Datchi Club								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Datchi Club		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning													COST:5	WT:10					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:A datchi club has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you cannot use it against an adjacent foe. This weapon, generally found in the arenas, is made by affixing a 4-5 foot length of dried insect hive or roots to a three-foot long shaft. Teeth, claws, or obsidian shards are embedded into the head of the weapon.
Gouge									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Gouge			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.TwoHanded.Piercing													COST:20	WT:12					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d10					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:Worn in an over-the-shoulder harness, the gouge is commonly found in the Nibenese infantry. A wide blade of bone, obsidian or chitin is mounted to a three-foot long shaft of wood. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of a gouge while you are wearing the harness. Donning the harness is a full-round action. Removing it is a move action.
Macahuitl, Great		KEY:Macahuitl (Great)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Macahuitl			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.TwoHanded.Slashing													COST:50	WT:12					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2												DAMAGE:2d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:A macahuitl is a sword painstakingly crafted using a core of solid wood, with small, sharp shards of obsidian embedded into the wood to form an edge on two opposite sides of the weapon. These weapons are swung like the scimitar, though macahuitls tend to require more maintenance. The macahuitl is especially popular among the Draji, who seem to be the only ones who can easily pronounce this weapon's Draji name ("ma-ka-wheet-luh"). Non-Draji simply refer to it as the "obsidian sword" or the "Draji sword."
Maul									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Maul				TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning													COST:25	WT:12					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d12					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:A maul is effectively a very large sledgehammer that crushes opponents to death. This weapon is commonly used by dwarves, muls, half-giants and other creatures that value great strength.
Tkaesali								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tkaesali			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.TwoHanded.Slashing													COST:8	WT:10					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d10					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:This polearm, commonly used by the nikaal, consists of long wooden haft topped with a circular, jagged blade. A tkaesali has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
Trikal								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Trikal			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.TwoHanded.Slashing													COST:10	WT:7					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:Three blades project radially from the business end of a six-foot long haft. A series of sharp serrated edges line the shaft below the foot-long blades, while the far end of the weapon is weighted, in order to balance the weapon. Because of the trikal's curved blades on the top of the weapon, trip attacks can also be made with it. If a character is tripped during his or her trip attempt, the trikal can be dropped to avoid being tripped.

#- Ranged
Atlatl								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Atlatl			TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Martial.Container								CONTAINS:UNLIM|AtlatlAmmo=1		COST:25	WT:6					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:The atlatl, sometimes called a "staff-sling," is a javelin-throwing device that is swung over the shoulder, using both hands. Javelins flung with an atlatl gain greater range than those thrown by hand.
Javenlin, Atlatl		KEY:Javenlin (Atlatl)									TYPE:Ammo.AtlatlAmmo																	COST:2	WT:2		BASEQTY:1
Crossbow, Fixed		KEY:Crossbow (Fixed)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Crossbow (Fixed)		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Martial																COST:200	WT:100				CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2												DAMAGE:2d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:This version of the crossbow can be fired by any capable of using it, but cannot be carried like a conventional crossbow. It is fixed in place, i.e. mounted on top of a wall, pole, or vehicle, and swivels so that you can aim the shot. Crossbows at the edge of a caravan, cart, or wall tend to offer cover, but limit your range of firing to a cone shape directly in front of the weapon. It is possible to mount a fixed crossbow on top of a pole but inside a shallow pit, giving you a 360-degree range of motion, while giving you cover. In any case, it is impossible to swivel a fixed crossbow in order to attack upwards (your upward angle is limited to 45 degrees). Reloading a fixed crossbow is a full-round action.

Bard's Friend							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Bard's Friend		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing														COST:20	WT:1					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:3												DAMAGE:1d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:This weapon is crafted with several obsidian blades and wooden prongs, which are fastened to a handle. Several small spikes jut out from where the knuckles hold the weapon. Bards are known for smearing these spikes with injury poison. The bard's friend can be coated with three charges of poison, but only one may be delivered per attack made with the weapon.
Ko									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Ko				TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing														COST:1	WT:3					CRITMULT:x4			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:The Ko combines a jagged blade that has been carved from a roughly oval stone. This exotic weapon of kreen manufacture is typically used in matching pairs. The ko. is designed to pierce chitin, shells and tough skin. If a ko. is used against a creature with natural armor, the attacker gets a +1 bonus to attack rolls.
Garrote, Bard's		KEY:Garrote (Bard's)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Garrote (Bard's)		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Bludgeoning													COST:200	WT:1					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:2d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:This exotic weapon is made from giant hair. A bard's garrote can only be used as part of a grapple attack, and you must wield it with both hands regardless of your size. As part of a grapple attack, using a garrote subjects you to attacks of opportunity and all other limitations described in the Player's Handbook grappling rules, except that as follows: The garrote inflicts 2d4 points of nonlethal damage plus 1.5 times your Strength bonus. You can use a bard's garrote to deliver a coup de grace (PH 153).
Handfork								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Handfork			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Slashing														COST:20	WT:2					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:The handfork, most popular among tareks, is a slicing weapon with a handle-grip and obsidian blades that join above the knuckles in an "M" shape.

It incorporates two flattened bones, joined in a hinge about two feet from the end. The result looks something like a nutcracker, and is used roughly in the same crushing way. If you hit an opponent at least one size category smaller than yourself with a lajav, you can immediately initiate a grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity (PH 155). Regardless of your size, you need two hands to use a lajav, since a second hand is required to catch the other end of the lajav. As with the gythka, kreen are able to wield two lajav at a time because of their four arms.
Singing Stick							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Singing Stick		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Bludgeoning													COST:10	WT:1					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:A singing stick is a carefully crafted and polished club, often used in pairs. Singing sticks draw their name from the characteristic whistling sound they make when used. A character proficient with singing sticks may use a pair of singing sticks as if he had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat. In the hands of a nonproficient character, singing sticks are nothing more than light clubs.
Talid									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Talid			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing														COST:40	WT:4					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:The talid, also known as the gladiator's gauntlet, is made of stiff leather with metal, chitin or bone plating on the hand cover and all along the forearm. Spikes protrude from each of the knuckles and along the back of the hand. A sharp blade runs along the thumb and there is a 6-inch spike on the elbow. A strike with a talid is considered an armed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single talid. An opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm a character's talid.
Widow's Knife							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Widow's Knife		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing														COST:50	WT:2					CRITMULT:x3			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:Two prongs are hidden within the hilt of a widow's knife. On a successful hit, you may trigger the prongs by releasing a catch in the hilt as a free action. The prongs do an additional 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small widow's knife) when sprung, and take a standard action to reload.
Wrist Razor								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Wrist Razor		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Slashing														COST:15	WT:2					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:2												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:Several shards of obsidian or bone are fastened to a strip of leather or other binding material, or are lashed onto the forearm of the wielder. Wrist razors are hard to disarm, granting you a +2 bonus when opposing a disarm attempt.

Usually made of bone, the heartpick is a hammer like weapon with a serrated pick on the front, and a heavy, flat head on the back.
Master's Whip							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Master's Whip		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.OneHanded.Slashing													COST:25	WT:5					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d3					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:The master's whip is usually braided from giant hair or leather, and has shards of chitin, obsidian or bone braided into the end of the whip. Unlike normal whips, the master's whip deals damage normally, has only a ten-foot range, and you apply your Strength modifier to damage dealt. In all other respects, it is treated as a normal whip.

Cahulak								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Cahulak			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Piercing.Double	ALTTYPE:Weapon.Melee.Piercing							COST:120	WT:12					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			ALTCRITMULT:x2		ALTCRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:1d6	ALTDAMAGE:1d6		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:A cahulak consists of two alaks (see above) joined by a 5-foot rope. You may fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with a light offhand weapon (PH 160). A creature using a double weapon in one hand, such as a half-giant using a set of cahulaks can't use it as a double weapon. When using a cahulak, add a +2 bonus on the opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if the character fails to disarm his or her opponent). Because the cahulak can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the cahulak to avoid being tripped. If you strike at an opponent 10 ft. away, you cannot use the cahulak as a double weapon unless you possess natural reach.
Crusher, Free		KEY:Crusher (Free)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Crusher (Free)		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning													COST:18	WT:12					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d10					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:The crusher is made from a large stone or metal weight, mounted at the end of a 15-foot long shaft of springy wood.

You need a 15-foot ceiling to use the weapon, but it can reach over cover. Crushers come in two varieties, fixed and free. A fixed crusher requires a base to use. The fixed crusher's base is enormously heavy, usually consisting of a thick slab of stone with a hole drilled through it to support the crusher's pole. The base is transported separately from the pole, and it takes one full minute to set the fixed crusher up for battle. The fixed crusher is a martial weapon, finding most use in infantry units. It is possible to use the crusher pole without the base as a free crusher, but this requires considerable expertise. You need an exotic weapon proficiency in the free crusher to accomplish this feat without the -4 proficiency penalty, even if you are proficient in the fixed crusher.

A basket guards your hands from attack, granting a +2 bonus on all attempts to defend against being disarmed. A dragon's paw is a double weapon. You may fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with a light off-hand weapon (PH 160). A creature using a double weapon in one hand, such as a half-giant using a dragon's paw can't use it as a double weapon.

Swatter								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Swatter			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning													COST:100	WT:35					CRITMULT:x4			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:2d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:The swatter is a popular name for a half-giant weapon consisting of a heavy spiked club made from hardwood, with a bronze or lead core in the tip for added weight. The swatter got its name from the tales of a halfgiant soldier who reputedly used a similar weapon to defeat an entire thri-kreen hunting party.
Mekillot Sap							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mekillot Sap		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning													COST:25	WT:30					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:2d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:The mekillot sap is a soft but tough large leather bag filled with fine gravel or sand, stitched together with giant's hair, and tied to the end of a fivefoot rope. The throwing sap is swung overhead with both hands. A mekillot sap has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike other weapons with reach, you can grip the rope higher, and use the mekillot sap against an adjacent foe. You can make trip attacks with the mekillot sap. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sap to avoid being tripped. You get a +2 bonus to your opposed Strength check when attempting to trip your opponent.

Chatkcha								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Chatkcha			TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Exotic.Piercing															COST:20	WT:3					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:The chatkcha returns to a proficient thrower on a missed attack roll. To catch it, the character must make an attack roll against AC 10 using the same bonus they threw the chatkcha with. Failure indicates the weapon falls to the ground 10 ft. in a random direction from the thrower. Catching the chatkcha is part of the attack and does not count as a separate attack.
Dejada								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Dejada			TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Exotic.Piercing															COST:20	WT:2					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d6					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:The dejada allows the wielder to throw pelota (see the pelota description for details). These pelotas deal more damage than those thrown by hand, due to the great speed at which they are thrown from a dejada.

Lasso									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lasso			TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Bludgeoning															COST:2	WT:2					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1																				SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:This weapon consists of a rope that you can throw and then draw closed. The total range of your lasso depends on the length of the rope. Throwing a lasso is a ranged touch attack. If you successfully hit your opponent, make a grapple check. If you succeed at the grapple check, then your opponent is grappled, and you can continue the grapple contest by continuing to pull on the rope. You can make trip attacks with a lasso against a grappling opponent. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso to avoid being tripped.
Skyhammer								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Skyhammer			TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Exotic.Bludgeoning														COST:50	WT:6					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d10					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:The sky hammer consists of a 10-foot length of rope with a large hammer-like object at one end. Its rope is coiled and swung around the body twohandedly until enough momentum is gained to hurl the hammer at a target. A successful hit grants a free trip attempt, and you receive a +4 bonus to your opposed Strength roll due to the momentum of the skyhammer.
Splashbow								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Splashbow			TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Exotic.Container.Bludgeoning							CONTAINS:UNLIM|SplashBowAmmo=1	COST:300	WT:60					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1												DAMAGE:1d4					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:This exotic weapon looks like a misshapen crossbow, only three feet long from bow to handle, but with a horizontal bow nearly five feet wide. Rather than bolts, the splashbow fires hinged pelotas, which can be filled with splash-globes of alchemical fire, contact poison, acids, or other interesting liquids. Splash- globes burst on impact, spraying their contents like a thrown grenade. The splashbow takes a full round to draw and load, assuming that the hinged pelotas have already been prepared.
Pelota, Hinged		KEY:Pelota (Hinged)									TYPE:Ammo.SplashbowAmmo.DejadaAmmo.Bludgeoning													COST:5	WT:2																												SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:To the careless eye a hinged pelota looks like an ordinary pelota without obsidian spikes. Hinged pelota can be twisted open like a small jar. Bards and assassins often use this feature to insert a splashglobe- a thin crystal sphere that contains acid, injury poison, contact poison, alchemical fire, or some other liquid. When the pelota strikes, the globe breaks, spilling the liquid through the holes of the pelota. Like pelota, hinged pelota can be thrown with a dejada. Hinged pelotas are also used as ammunition for the splashbow.
Zerka									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Zerka			TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Exotic.Piercing															COST:30	WT:9					CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:3												DAMAGE:1d8					SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	SPROP:The zerka is a javelin with short barbs that cover two feet of the bone shaft. These barbs point away from the zerka's tip, causing the weapon's head to snag against its target's flesh and bone as it is removed. If a zerka hits, it lodges in the victim if he fails a Reflex save (DC equal to 5 + damage inflicted). A failed check means the zerka is stuck and the victim moves at half-speed, cannot charge or run, and must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + spell level) in order to cast a spell with somatic components. The victim can pull the zerka from his wound with a move action if he has at least one hand free, but suffers an additional 1d4 damage. A Heal check DC 13 allows the zerka to be removed without further injury.

###Block: Special Substances and Items
# Equipment Name				Type					Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Esperweed					TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:250	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	SPROP:This rare and notoriously addictive herb cannot be cultivated, and does not last more than a single week after being picked, unless somehow magically kept fresh (as through the nurturing seeds spell). After esperweed is eaten, a DC 12 Fortitude save must be made. Failure results in nausea for one minute. If the save is made, the eater has managed keep the esperweed down, taking 1d4 points of Strength damage, but you also begin to regain one power point per minute, up to 10% above your normal power point limit (round down). You also gain the empathy power as a psi-like ability that can be used once per day. Manifester level is equal to 1/2 Hit Dice (minimum 1st). These benefits last for one hour, after which you lose all remaining power points. These power points are spent first when manifesting powers (much like temporary hit points).
Hypnotic Brew				TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:30	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	SPROP:This is a tasteless, odorless mixture of herbs commonly peddled in Bard's Quarters. It is typically used by bards and mindbender to "soften up" a target before attempting to manipulate or manifest a power. When a hypnotic brew is imbibed, the drinker's Will saves suffer a -2 circumstance penalty for 1 hour if they fail a Fortitude save (DC 15).
Pre-poisoned Darts			TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:10	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	SPROP:Athasian bards sometimes sell especially prepared blowgun darts that contain a dose of injected poison inside a hollow tip, protected with a wax plug. This reduces the risk of self-poisoning to 2% rather than 5%. You can remove the wax plug as a free action while preparing to fire the dart.
Splash-globe (Empty)			TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:0	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	SPROP:Splash-globes are spherical glass jars containing contact poison or up to half a pint of some alchemical fluid. In addition to bursting on impact like any grenade, splash-globes can be placed in hinged pelota, thus giving the grenade additional range when fired through a splash-bow or dejada.
Splash-globe (Acid)			TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:10	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	SPROP:Standard flask acid can be placed in splash-globes.
Splash-globe (Contact Poison)		TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:0	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	SPROP:Any contact poison can be placed in a splash-globe.
Splash-globe (Liquid Darkness)	TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:35	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.117	SPROP:Anyone struck directly by liquid darkness must make a Reflex save (DC 15) or be blinded for one minute. Those splashed with liquid darkness have their vision blurred for one minute if they fail a DC 15 Reflex save, granting their opponents concealment. In addition, all natural fires within the splash area are instantly extinguished. Liquid darkness immediately extinguishes liquid light.
Splash-globe (Liquid Dust)		TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:25	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:The liquid from this splash-globe turns into dust on contact with the air. You can use this liquid to cover up to 20 5-foot squares of tracks. On impact, liquid dust forms a 15-foot diameter cloud, ten feet high that lasts one round. Alternately, liquid dust can be launched via slash-globes. Anyone struck directly by liquid dust must make a DC 15 Fortitude save each round for one minute; failure dictates that they are nauseated for that round. Those splashed with liquid dust suffer the same effect for one round if they fail a DC 15 Fortitude save.
Splash-globe (Liquid Fire)		TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:Alchemist's fire can be placed in splashglobes.
Splash-globe (Liquid Light)		TYPE:Goods.Special Substances	COST:40	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:This splash-globe contains two liquids that mix together when the splash-globe is ruptured. The resulting mixture glows for eight hours. If you break the liquid light globe while it is still in its pouch, the pouch can serve as a light source just like a sunrod. Anyone struck directly by liquid light must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be temporarily dazzled (-1 on all attack rolls) for 1 minute, and will glow in darkness for eight hours unless they somehow cover the affected areas. Creatures splashed with liquid light (see grenade rules) also glow in the darkness, but are not blinded.

###Block: Tools and Skill Kits
# Equipment Name		Type		Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Candle of Rejuvenation	TYPE:Tools	COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:This item allows a manifester to recover power points as if he were resting at night.

###Block: Clothing
# Equipment Name		Type			Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Elven Outfit		TYPE:Clothing	COST:30	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:Although varying greatly from tribe to tribe, all elven clothing is based around two concepts: functionality and flattery. This set of clothes most often includes a hooded cloak or stylized robes, although some outfits make do with tight leather wrappings or other heat-shielding and water-retaining materials. In regards to its other aspect-visual appeal-every elven outfit is, no matter how functional, also designed to complement the wearer's form. Each outfit is tailor-made by elves, following a particular tribal pattern, and are normally not for sale. In addition, various portions of this outfit-such as a cloak, thick shoulder scarf, or even an entire tunic- are colored, patterned, or designed to be reversible in such a way as to blend in with the Athasian landscape, helping the wearer to blend in with the terrain in sandy areas: this provides a +3 circumstance bonus on Hide checks while in desert terrain. For twice the listed price, this outfit can be made to fit over light armor.
High Templar's Outfit	TYPE:Clothing	COST:100	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:High templar's outfits differ for each of the Tablelands' cities. This set of clothing is made of the best material produced by a city-state's artisans and exemplifies that city's templarate. Wearing the proper high templar outfit for a city's templarate gives a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks in contests of Secular Authority made within that city.
Royal Defiler's Outfit	TYPE:Clothing	COST:80	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:Royal defilers, who practice sorcery with the full legal backing of a sorcerer-king, must clearly indicate their protected status if they are to be spared the mob's wrath. This set of clothing is made from the best materials available to a city-state's artisans, and is second in quality only to a templar's outfit. The outfit varies greatly from city to city. In Raam, for example, this outfit is a checkered silk robe adorned with a silver brooch denoting royal defiler status. Wearing the proper defiler outfit for a city gives a +2 circumstance bonus to Intimidate checks against citizens who aren't part of the templarate.
Slave's Outfit		TYPE:Clothing	COST:0.02	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	SPROP:This simple set of clothes consists of a loincloth, or a short skirt and sleeveless tunic, all made of rough-hewn materials.
Wastelander's Outfit	TYPE:Clothing	COST:20	WT:6		SOURCEPAGE:p.119	SPROP:Similar to clothing worn by the many elven tribes dotting the Athasian landscape, this set of clothes commonly includes a large hooded cloak, multiple layers of heat-resistant, porous cloth, and reinforced leather padding designed to protect against blowing sand, sharp rocks and the ever-present cacti needles. In addition, this outfit is colored to blend in with whatever environment the wastelander has chosen as his home, helping the wearer to blend in with rocky surroundings. This provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Hide checks while in the appropriate terrain; each wastelander's outfit provides this bonus for a single terrain type only. For twice the price, this outfit can be made to fit over light armor.

###Block: Documents
# Equipment Name		Type			Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Letter of Marque		TYPE:Documents	COST:0	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.119	SPROP:This letter bears the personal mark of the sorcerer-king, and bestows limited secular authority on the bearer, as if the bearer were a templar. The bearer of a letter of marque gains the authority to contest the actions of templars, using the bearer's Diplomacy check. If the bearer is already a templar, then having the letter as additional authority grants the templar a +4 circumstance check towards authority contest checks. The letter of marque does not grant the authority to Intrude, Requisition, Accuse or Judge, but does grant power to contest such actions by templars. A letter of marque is limited by time. After a specified period (usually one year, and never longer than seven years) the letter loses its effectiveness. A sorcerer-king can also declare the letter invalid. Forging or fraudulently using a letter of marque is an unpardonable offense that brings a death sentence. Obviously, only the templars and other servants of the sorcerer-king that issued the letter of marque will honor its terms. A person who is caught with a king's letter of marque within another sorcerer-king's territory will have some explaining to do.
Letter of Reprisal	TYPE:Documents	COST:0	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.119	SPROP:Like a letter of marque, this letter bears the personal mark of the sorcerer-king, and bestows limited secular authority on the bearer, as if the bearer were a templar. Unlike a letter of marque, a letter of reprisal has a limited scope to carrying out a specific mission, usually a reprisal or retaliation against a specific group of the King's enemies, for example, killing or capturing a specific enemy officer, capturing a particular enemy fortress or silt vessel, defiling a stretch of key farmland, or annihilating or enslaving a designated village. Depending on the bearer's Diplomacy ranks, she can Requisition, Intrude, Accuse, Judge, but only if she can show that her request relates to fulfilling her assigned mission. She can attempt to contest the actions of other templars, but takes a -4 circumstance penalty on such attempts, since the opposing templars can argue (even if it is not true) that she is acting outside of the scope of the assigned reprisal mission. The -4 penalty also applies if templars contest any of her Requisition, Intrude, Accuse, or Judge actions.
