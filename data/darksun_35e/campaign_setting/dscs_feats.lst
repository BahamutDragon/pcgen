#Item Creation Feats
CATEGORY=FEAT|Brew Potion.MOD																																																																																																										DESC:On Athas, potions take many different forms. The most common form is an enchanted fruit, often called a potionfruit. Other common items for enchantment include obsidian orbs, packs of herbs, and bone fetishes. The potion, regardless of material used to make it, is consumed or destroyed when used. Due to the nature of their magic, defilers cannot enchant organic materials, such as fruits, as a potion. As a consequence, most non-defilers use those receptacles almost exclusively, as a way of assuring the potion is not a product of defiler magic.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Scribe Scroll.MOD																																																																																																										DESC:On Athas, scrolls take many different forms. Common forms include paper or papyrus sheets, clay tablets, and woven cloth.
