# CVS $Revision: $ $Author: $ -- Sun Mar  2 17:27:55 2014 -- reformated by prettylst.pl v1.51 (build )

#Notes:
#There are several skill modifications listed, but those only impact what the skills can be used for, which is not handled
#by pcgen.
#The Craft (Poison) skill is referenced several times, including synergy bonusses, but it's not actually included in the skill set.
#Therefore, I'm not including it in the list.
