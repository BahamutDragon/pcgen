Accurate Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can lessen your attack's damage to make a wider, more sweeping attack with a better chance to hit. Subtract a number up to 5 from your attack's damage bonus and add the same number to your attack roll. You cannot lower your damage bonus below 0 nor more than double your attack bonus.
Acrobatic Bluff	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:You can use your Acrobatics skill in place of your Bluff skill to feint and trick in combat (see the Bluff skill in Chapter Two). Your opponent opposes the attempt with Sense Motive or Acrobatics (whichever is better).
All-out Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:With an All-out Attack, you ignore defense in favor of accuracy. Subtract a number up to 5 from your dodge and parry bonus and add the same number to your attack roll. You cannot lower your bonus below 0 nor more than double your attack bonus.
Animal Empathy	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a special connection with animals. You can use the Handle Animal skill like Diplomacy to change the attitude of an animal by interacting with it. Unlike a normal use of Diplomacy, you do not have to speak a language the animal understands, and Animal Empathy affects creatures with Intelligence -4 or less normally. You can also use the Bluff and Gather Information skills normally on animals. You don't actually need to speak to the animals; you communicate your intent through gestures and body language and learn things by studying animal behavior. Special: The Narrator may allow other forms of this feat for interacting with other unusual creatures, such as Machine Empathy, Plant Empathy, Spirit Empathy, Undead Empathy, and so forth. The specifics of using interaction skills with any unusual subjects are left up to the Narrator.
Armor Training	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're trained to move and fight while wearing armor. There are two versions of this feat: light and heavy. The heavy version covers both medium and heavy types of armor. Each is considered a separate feat, and you must be trained in wearing light armor before you can acquire training in heavy armor. Characters without Armor Training apply their armor's check penalty (see Armor in Chapter Five) to all physical rolls and checks while wearing it, including attack rolls. Characters with Armor Training only apply the armor's check penalty to Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Swim checks.
Assessment	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're able to size up someone's combat capabilities by observing them carefully. As a move action, choose a subject and make a Sense Motive check opposed by the subject's Bluff check result. If you succeed, the Narrator tells you the subject's combat bonus relative to yours (lower, higher, or equal). You don't know the subject's exact bonus unless it equals your own, only a rough estimate of relative ability. In cases of a 5-point or greater difference, the Narrator may choose to tell you the subject's bonus is considerably more or less than yours. If you lose the opposed roll, the Narrator should over- or under-estimate the subject's bonus.
Attack Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have unusual prowess in one particular kind of attack. Choose one attack: unarmed, grapple, a type of weapon, or a supernatural power. You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls you make using the selected attack. You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new attack.
Attack Specialization	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:Prerequisite: Attack Focus with the chosen attack.	DESC: Choose an attack for which you have already selected the Attack Focus feat. You deal +1 damage when using this attack. You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new attack.
Attractive	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're particularly attractive, giving you a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to deceive, seduce, or change the attitude of anyone who might find you appealing.
Benefit	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have some significant perquisite or fringe benefit. The exact nature of the benefit is for you and the Narrator to determine. As a rule of thumb it should not exceed the benefits of any other feat. A license to practice law or medicine, for example, should not be considered a benefit; it's simply a part of having enough ranks in the appropriate skill(s) and has no significant game effect. The following are some potential Benefits. The Narrator is free to choose any suitable Benefit for the campaign. &nl;. Alternate Identity: You have an alternate identity, complete with legal paperwork (driver's license, birth certificate, etc.). &nl;. Diplomatic Immunity: By dint of your diplomatic status, you cannot be prosecuted for crimes in nations other than your own. All another nation can do is deport you to your home nation. &nl;. Security Clearance: You have access to classified government information, installations, and possibly equipment and personnel. &nl;. Status: By virtue of birth or achievement, you have special status. Examples include nobility, knighthood, aristocracy, being a samurai in medieval Japan, and so forth. &nl;The Narrator is the final arbiter as to what does and does not constitute a Benefit in the campaign. Keep in mind some qualities may constitute Benefits in some campaigns, but not in others, depending on whether or not they have any real impact on the game.
Blind-Fight	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:In melee combat, you suffer half the usual miss chance due to concealment (see Concealment, in Chapter Six). If you spend a Conviction point before rolling the miss chance, you automatically ignore it for that attack (you gain no other benefit from the Conviction point). You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see; darkness and poor visibility reduce your speed to three-quarters rather than half.
Canny Dodge	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:When unarmored and unencumbered, add your Intelligence or Wisdom score as a dodge bonus to your Defense. Choose which bonus applies when you acquire this feat. The bonus from this feat is in addition to the standard dodge bonus granted by your Dexterity. You lose your Canny Dodge bonus if you are wearing armor or carrying more than a light load.
Challenge	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE=Challenges	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose a specific challenge (see Challenges in the Introduction). You can pick a standard challenge or one from a skill's individual description in Chapter Two. For standard challenges, the challenge only applies to a specific task. So, for example, if you choose the Fast Task challenge, you need to specify a task, such as the feint application of Bluff, or making an item with Craft. If you take Calculated Risk, you need to specify the two checks (and the skills used for them), and if you take Simultaneous Tasks, you need to specify the two tasks. Once specified, these things do not change. You can perform the challenge chosen under this feat with a 5-point lesser modifier than usual. So, for challenges with a -5 penalty or a +5 Difficulty, you perform them like normal checks. For challenges with a greater modifier, you reduce the modifier accordingly. So a hero with Fast Feint, as an example, can feint in combat as a move action with no Bluff check modifier (since the normal modifier is -5). You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different challenge.
Chokehold	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:If you pin an opponent while grappling, you can apply a chokehold, causing your opponent to begin suffocating for as long as you maintain the pin. See Chapter Six for details on grappling and suffocation. When pinned with the Chokehold feat, the victim must start making Difficulty 10 Con checks the round after failing the grapple check (see the rules for Suffocation on Page 112).
Cleave	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:If you knock out, disable, or kill an opponent with a melee attack, you get an immediate extra melee attack against another opponent within reach. You can't move before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and attack bonus as the attack that downed your previous opponent. You can use this feat once per round.
Connected	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You know people who can help you out from time to time. You can call in favors by making a Diplomacy check. It might be advice, information, help with a legal matter, or access to resources. The Narrator sets the Difficulty of the Diplomacy check, based on the aid required. A simple favor is Difficulty 10, ranging up to Difficulty 25 or higher for especially difficult, dangerous, or expensive favors. You can spend a Conviction point to automatically secure the favor. The Narrator has the right to veto any request if it is too involved or likely to spoil the plot of the adventure. Use of this feat always requires at least a few minutes (and often much longer) and the means to contact your allies.
Contacts	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have such extensive and well-informed contacts that you can make a Gather Information check in only one minute, assuming you have some means of getting in touch with your contacts. You can take 10 or take 20 on this check (taking 20 requires 20 minutes rather than 1). Further Gather Information checks on the same subject require the normal length of time, as you need to widen your search.
Crippling Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Sneak Attack	DESC:Prerequisite: Sneak Attack.	DESC: You can sneak attack opponents with such precision that your attacks weaken them. Anyone suffering lethal damage from one of your sneak attacks also takes 1 point of Strength damage. Lost Strength returns at a rate of 1 point per day.
Critical Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Favored Opponent	DESC:Prerequisite: Favored Opponent.	DESC: You can score critical hits normally on favored opponents that are immune to critical hits. This benefit only affects your favored opponent(s).
Dedicated	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are deeply dedicated to a person or cause (and should roleplay this). You have a +4 bonus on saving throws and checks against effects that would sway you from your dedication. Whenever you spend a Conviction point to re-roll a die roll directly concerning your dedication, the roll is treated as a 20 (but not a natural 20). The Narrator decides when this is appropriate. If you fail or waver in your dedication, you lose the benefits of this feat. You can only regain them by renewing your dedication.
Defensive Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:A defensive attack is more cautious, trading accuracy for protection. Subtract a number up to 5 from your attack bonus and add the same number to your dodge or parry bonus for the round. You cannot lower your attack bonus below 0, nor more than double your dodge or parry bonus.
Defensive Roll	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:You can evade damage through agility and "rolling" with an attack. You receive a +1 bonus to your Toughness saving throws, but lose your Defensive Roll bonus whenever you are denied your dodge bonus or unable to take a free action. You can take this feat multiple times and its benefits stack.
Deflect Arrows	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:You can bat arrows and similar ranged weapons (such as thrown objects) out of the air. You must have at least one hand free to use this feat. Once per round, when you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may deflect it as a reaction so you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. You cannot deflect bullets, energy beams, or similar ranged attacks.
Diehard	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:When your condition is reduced to dying, you automatically succeed on the Constitution check to stabilize on the following round. Further damage can still kill you.
Dodge Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your dodge bonus increases by +1. This additional dodge bonus is lost in the same way as your regular dodge bonus, when you are flat-footed and so forth. You can acquire this feat multiple times and its benefits stack.
Eidetic Memory	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have perfect recall of everything you've experienced. You have a +4 bonus on checks to remember things, including saving throws against effects that alter or erase memories. You can make any Knowledge skill check untrained, meaning you can answer questions involving difficult or obscure knowledge without ranks in a skill.
Elusive Target	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:You are expert at dodging and weaving around your foes, making you an elusive target while you're engaged in a melee. When you are fighting in melee combat, others attempting to target you with ranged attacks are at a -8 penalty rather than the usual -4 penalty for shooting into melee combat.
Empower	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:You can increase the effective rank of your powers, putting more of your energy and will behind them. For each effective rank you add to a power, increase the fatigue Difficulty of using it by +2. You cannot empower a power by more than +5 ranks (for +10 to the fatigue Difficulty).
Endurance	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You gain a +4 bonus on Swim checks to avoid becoming fatigued, and +4 on Constitution checks or Fortitude saves to hold your breath, to avoid damage from starvation or thirst, and to avoid damage from hot or cold environments.
Erase Signature	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:Prerequisites: Second Sight power.	DESC: You can erase supernatural signatures, eliminating evidence of them. You must first be able to sense a signature. It then takes a full-round action to erase it. See Chapter Four: Powers for more information.
Evasion	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:If you make your Reflex save against an area effect, you suffer no damage. See Chapter Six for more information on area effects.
Exotic Weapon Training	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're trained in the use of a particular exotic weapon. Each exotic weapon requires a separate feat. For a list of exotic weapons, see Chapter Five: Equipment.
Familiar	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:You have a supernatural bond with a special animal companion. Choose a 1st-level animal as your familiar (see Chapter Eight for animal descriptions).	DESC:&nl;Your familiar is an enhanced version of the chosen animal, referred to as the base animal. The Familiar table indicates how the base animal is enhanced.	DESC:&nl;Adept Level: Enhancements to the familiar's traits are based on your adept level. A familiar's combat bonus is the same as an expert of your adept level, and a familiar has good Fortitude and Reflex saves and normal Will saves like an expert of your adept level.	DESC:&nl;Abilities: This is a bonus to the base animal's Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence scores.	DESC:&nl;Bonus Tricks: The number in this column is the total number of tricks the familiar knows, in addition to any you might choose to teach it using the Handle Animal skill. These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. You select these bonus tricks, and once chosen, they can't be changed.	DESC:&nl;Link: You have a psychic link with your familiar. The two of you are always in mental contact (like a use of the Mind Touch power). If some outside force, such as the Ward power, interferes, you can make a power check to overcome it. If your psychic link is broken, it is automatically reestablished as soon as possible. Because of your link, you can handle your familiar as a free action and push it as a move action, even if you aren't trained in the Handle Animal skill. You get a +4 bonus on interaction checks involving your familiar.	DESC:&nl;Share Powers: You can choose to have any power you use on yourself also affect your familiar. This includes powers like Body Control and Psychic Shield, which normally only affect the user. The familiar must be within 5 feet of you when the power is used to receive its effects. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar when the familiar moves farther than 5 feet away from you and does not affect it again, even if it returns while the power is still in effect.	DESC:&nl;Evasion: Your familiar gains the Evasion feat.	DESC:&nl;Dedicated: Your familiar gains the Dedicated feat towards you.	DESC:&nl;Speak: Your familiar can speak verbally with you as if you shared a common language. Others cannot understand your communication without the use of powers.	DESC:&nl;Improved Evasion: Your familiar gains the Improved Evasion feat.
Far Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.	DESC: When you use a projectile weapon, such as a bow or firearm, its range increment increases by half (multiply by 1.5). When you use a thrown weapon, its range increment doubles (multiply by 2).
Fascinate	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:Prerequisite: Trained in the chosen interaction skill	DESC: One of your interaction skills is so effective you can capture and hold someone's attention with it. Choose Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform. Use a standard action and make a check using the interaction skill against your target's Sense Motive check or Will saving throw result (whichever has the higher bonus). If you succeed, the target pays no attention to anyone other than you. You may maintain the effect by taking a standard action each round, for a maximum number of rounds equal to your skill rank. Any potential threat, such as an ally sneaking up on a fascinated target, grants a new Sense Motive check or Will save. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, automatically breaks the fascination. The fascination ends when you stop maintaining it or the target overcomes it. You may take this feat more than once. Each time, it applies to a different interaction skill.
Favored Opponent	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:You have a particular type of opponent you've studied or are especially effective against. It may be a type of creature, like animals or the undead; a profession, like soldiers or thieves; or any other category the Narrator approves. Especially broad categories, like "all humanoids" or "all villains," are not permitted. You get a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Notice, Sense Motive, and Survival checks when dealing with your favored opponent, as well as +1 damage on all attacks against them. You may take this feat multiple times, either choosing a different favored opponent or stacking with your existing bonus to a maximum of +6 on skills checks and +3 damage.

Grappling Finesse	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:You can use your Dexterity bonus, rather than your Strength bonus, to make grapple checks. You retain your dodge bonus to Defense against all opponents while grappling. See Chapter Six for more on grappling.
Great Cleave	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Cleave	DESC:Prerequisite: Cleave.	DESC: This feat works like Cleave, except you can use it an unlimited number of times per round, until you miss an attack or there are no more opponents within range.

Greater Attack Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Attack Focus	DESC:Prerequisite: Attack Focus.	DESC: You gain an additional +1 attack bonus with the chosen attack. The benefit of this feat stacks with Attack Focus.
Greater Attack Specialization	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Attack Specialization	DESC:Prerequisite: Attack Specialization	DESC: You gain an additional +1 damage bonus with the chosen attack. The benefit of this feat stacks with Attack Specialization.
Hide in Plain Sight	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PRESKILL:1,Stealth=13	DESC:Prerequisite: Stealth rank 13	DESC: You can make Stealth checks while being observed and even if you do not have cover or concealment. Characters normally must have cover or concealment to hide and cannot make Stealth checks while being observed.
Imbue Item	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:You can craft supernatural items, including weapons, armor, and charms. It takes the normal time to make the item, but its cost is increased. See Supernatural Items in Chapter Five for details.
Improved Critical	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your critical threat range with a particular attack is doubled. An attack that normally threatens a critical on a natural 20 instead threatens a critical on a 19 or 20, an attack that normally threatens a critical on a 19 or 20 instead threatens a critical on 17-20, and so forth. You can take this feat multiple times. Each time it applies to a different attack.
Improved Defense	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:When you take a total defense action in combat you gain a +6 bonus rather than the usual +4 bonus. You can take this feat a second time, giving you a +8 bonus when you take a total defense action.
Improved Disarm	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a +2 bonus on attack rolls when attempting to disarm an opponent, who does not get an opportunity to disarm you if you fail (see Disarm in Chapter Six).
Improved Evasion	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Evasion	DESC:Prerequisite: Evasion.	DESC: This works like Evasion except you only take half damage from an area effect even if you fail the Reflex save, and no damage if you succeed.
Improved Grab	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:When you hit with an unarmed attack, you can immediately make a grapple check against that opponent as a free action. Your unarmed attack counts as the initial attack roll required to start grappling. The opponent must be no larger than your size category. See Grapple in Chapter Six for details.
Improved Initiative	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You get a +4 bonus on initiative checks.
Improved Pin	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your grappling attacks are particularly difficult to escape. Opponents suffer a -4 penalty on grappling checks against you to escape a grapple or pin.

Improved Speed	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your speed increases by 10 feet while wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. You can take this feat multiple times. Each time it increases your speed by 10 feet, to a maximum increase of +30 feet.
Improved Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can inflict lethal damage with your unarmed strikes. Normally, unarmed attacks only inflict non-lethal damage. Your unarmed attacks are also more effective than normal. Increase your unarmed striking (but not grappling) damage by +1 for every four total levels, rounding up (+1 at levels 1-4, +2 at levels 5-8, and so forth).

Inspire	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:STRING|Awe|Competence|Complacency|Courage|Fear|Fury	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PRESTAT:1,CHA=1	DESC:Prerequisite: Charisma +1 or higher.	DESC: You can inspire others with your presence. You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you acquire a new type of inspiration. Using any Inspire effect requires a standard action and is considered a use of an interaction skill, even though no skill check is required. This means your subjects have to be able to hear and understand you. You can affect a number of subjects equal to half your expert level (with a minimum of one), and the effects last for a number of rounds equal to your expert level. Unwilling targets make a Will saving throw (Difficulty 10 + half your expert level + your Charisma). You can use any combination of Inspire effects a total of once per day per two expert levels with a minimum of one (so a 6th-level expert can Inspire three times per day). You can spend a point of Conviction for an additional use of Inspire that day. Each time you take this feat, choose one of the following effects: Awe: The subjects are overcome with your presence. They are dazed (taking no action, but defending normally) for one round. On each of the following rounds, subjects can make a Will save (with a cumulative +1 bonus for each save) to shake off their awe and act normally. Competence: Subjects are better able to focus on the task at hand, gaining a +2 bonus on all skill checks. Complacency: The subjects let down their guard. They suffer a -5 penalty on Notice and Sense Motive checks. This also counts as a distraction sufficient to hide using Stealth. Courage: The subjects overcome fear and doubt. They gain a +1 bonus on saves against fear and doubt and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage. This bonus increases to +2 when you are an 8th level expert, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th. Fear: Subjects are overcome with fear and anxiety. They are shaken and suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, checks, and saving throws (except Toughness saves). If the save fails by 5 or more, they are panicked and flee from you as quickly as possible. Fury: Subjects gain the benefits of the Rage feat but also the normal fatigue when the rage wears off. The rage lasts for the duration of your inspiration (rounds equal to your expert level) rather than its normal duration, but so does the fatigue.
Iron Will	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You get a +2 bonus on all Will saving throws.
Jack-of-All-Trades	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:You can use any skill untrained, even skills that normally cannot be used untrained. You must still have proper tools if a skill requires them.
Leadership	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=6	DESC:Prerequisite: 6th level.	DESC: You attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist you. See the tables for what sort of companion and how many followers you can recruit, based on your leadership score. Several factors can affect your Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score, which is equal to your total level plus your Charisma: Cross-reference your final leadership score with the table to determine the level(s) of a companion or any followers you attract.
Light Sleeper	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You do not suffer the +10 Difficulty modifier to Notice checks for being asleep. This means you're much less likely to be caught by surprise while sleeping. You can also act normally immediately upon waking. Other characters are normally dazed for one round after waking (taking no actions, but defending normally).
Lightning Reflexes	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You get a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.
Low Profile	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're less well known than you might be. Reduce your Reputation score by 3 each time you acquire this feat. Your Reputation cannot decrease below +0.
Lucky	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PRESTAT:1,CHA=1	DESC:Prerequisite: Charisma +1.	DESC: The universe just seems to like you. Add your Charisma score as a bonus to your Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saving throws.
Mass Suggestion	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Suggestion	DESC:Prerequisite: Suggestion.	DESC: You can make the same suggestion simultaneously to any number of subjects you have already fascinated (see the Suggestion feat). You must make the same suggestion to everyone.
Master Plan	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:If you have the opportunity to prepare for an encounter, you can formulate a plan to deal with it. This requires at least a few minutes, longer at the Narrator's discretion. Make an Intelligence check (Difficulty 10). If successful, you and your allies gain a bonus on all skill checks and attack rolls in the scene depending on the result of your check: +1 for a roll of 10-14, +2 for 15-24, and +3 for 25 or higher. You choose when during the scene to initiate your master plan. The bonus lasts for 3 rounds, then begins decreasing at a rate of 1 per round until it is gone. You can only use this feat when you have the opportunity to prepare for an encounter in advance, not when dealing with sudden or unexpected encounters.
Mind Over Body	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:You can exert great mental control over your body. When you make Constitution checks, you can substitute your Wisdom score for your Constitution score, so long as you are conscious. You can also apply your Wisdom bonus rather than your Constitution bonus to your Fortitude saving throws.
Move-by Action	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:When taking a standard action you can move both before and after the action, provided your total distance isn't greater than your movement speed.
Night Vision	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can see twice as far in low-light conditions as a normal human. Your vision is still hindered normally by total darkness.
Overrun	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vehicular Combat	DESC:Prerequisite: Vehicular Combat.	DESC: When you attempt to overrun an opponent while mounted or in a vehicle, your target may not choose to avoid you. A successfully-tripped target suffers +1 damage per 10 MPH of your vehicle's speed or your mount's normal melee damage (if you are riding a mount).
Point Blank Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You get a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage with all ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.
Precise Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot	DESC:Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.	DESC: You can make ranged attacks on an opponent engaged in melee with your allies without the usual -4 penalty. When attacking an opponent with the Elusive Target feat, you suffer a -4 penalty rather than -8.
Prone Fighting	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You suffer no penalties on your attack rolls for being prone, and opponents do not gain any bonus to hit you with melee attacks while you are prone. Opponents making ranged attacks against you still have -4 on their attack rolls. You can crawl at half your speed rather than the usual 5-feet per move action.
Quick Draw	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can draw or load a weapon as a free action, rather than a move action. You can only do one of these things as a free action each round; the other remains a move action, as normal. So you could draw a weapon as a free action, then load it as a move action, for example, but not draw and load it as a free action. Taking this feat a second time allows you to both draw and load a weapon in the same round as free actions.
Quicken Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:Once per round, you can use a power that normally requires a full-round action as a standard action, or a power that normally requires a standard action as a move action. You can't use powers more quickly than a move action using this feat. The fatigue Difficulty of the quickened power increases by +8.
Rage	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:You can fly into a berserk rage as a free action, gaining +2 Strength, +2 to your Fortitude and Will saves, and a -2 penalty to Defense. While raging you can't use skills or powers requiring concentration or patience, and you can't take 10 or take 20 on checks. Your rage lasts five rounds, after which you are fatigued for five rounds (see Fatigue in Chapter Six). You can use Rage once per day at 1st level and an additional time per day for every four warrior levels (twice at 4th level, three times at 8th level, and so on). You can spend a point of Conviction to use Rage an additional time that day.	DESC: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you gain an additional +1 Strength and +1 Fortitude and Will save bonus to a maximum of +4 Strength and +4 to saves total (the -2 penalty to Defense and other effects remain the same). Instead of increasing your Rage benefits, taking the Rage feat an additional time can extend the duration of your rage by 5 rounds (to a maximum of 20 rounds). This extends the duration of your post-rage fatigue by the same amount.
Ranged Pin	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can pin an opponent using a ranged weapon to nail a bit of clothing to a nearby surface. The target must be within 5 feet of a wall, tree, or similar surface. Make a normal attack roll against the target. If your attack is successful, the target is pinned. To break free, the victim must take a move action and make a successful Strength or Escape Artist check (Difficulty 15).
Redirect	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:You can redirect a missed attack against you from that opponent at another target. Make a Bluff check against your opponent as a standard action. If the Bluff succeeds, and the opponent's next attack against you misses, you can redirect it as a reaction. The new target must be adjacent to you and within range of the attack. The attacker makes a new attack roll with the same modifiers as the first against the new target. If there are no other targets in range, you cannot redirect the attack; it simply misses.
Run	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start, you get a +4 bonus to your Jump check.
Second Chance	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:USERINPUT|TITLE=Hazard	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose a particular hazard, such as falling, being tripped, triggering traps, being mentally controlled (or affected by another specific power), or a particular skill with consequences for failure. If you fail a saving throw against that hazard or a check with that skill, you can immediately make another roll and use the better of the two results. Unlike spending a Conviction point, you do not add 10 to rolls of 10 or less. You only get one second chance against any given save or task, and the Narrator decides if a particular hazard or skill is an appropriate focus for this feat. You can acquire this feat multiple times. Each time it applies to a different hazard or skill.
Seize Initiative	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:You can spend a Conviction point to go first in the initiative order, without having to roll for initiative. You may only do so when you would normally roll initiative. If more than one character uses this feat, they roll for initiative normally and act in order of their initiative result, followed by all the other characters involved in the combat.
Set-up	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can transfer the benefits of a successful combat use of an interaction skill to an ally. For example, you can feint and allow your ally to make the surprise attack against that opponent. The interaction skill requires its normal time and skill check and you must be able to interact with your ally.
Shield Penetration	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:You're proficient at overcoming the resistance of Psychic Shields. You get a +2 bonus on checks to overcome a target's Psychic Shield. See Chapter Four for more information.
Shield Training	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're trained in the proper use of shields in combat. You can use a shield and take only the standard penalties. Characters lacking Shield Training take a penalty on attack rolls and on Strength- and Dexterity-based checks equal to the shield's bonus.
Skill Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose a known skill. You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving that skill. You can acquire this feat multiple times. Each time you do, it applies to a different known skill.
Skill Mastery	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:Choose four of your known skills. When making checks with those skills, you can take 10 even when distracted or under pressure. This feat does not allow you to take 10 with skills that do not normally allow you to do so. You can acquire this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose four other known skills to master.
Skill Training	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Each time you take the Skill Training feat, you gain 4 additional skill ranks. You may apply these ranks in any manner that you wish, although they do not allow any of your skills to exceed the maximum rank for your level.
Slow Fall	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PRESKILL:1,Jump=5	DESC:Prerequisite: Jump rank 5.	DESC: You can slow a fall if within arm's reach of a wall or similar structure. Subtract 10 feet from the fall per two expert levels before determining damage, with falls of 0 or less doing no damage. At 20th level expert, you can use a nearby surface to slow your descent and fall any distance without harm.
Smite Opponent	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Favored Opponent	DESC:Prerequisite: Favored Opponent.	DESC: You can charge a blow with the power of your determination. You can use Smite Opponent once per day per four warrior levels, rounded up. When you strike a favored opponent in melee, you can activate this feat: add your Charisma score to your attack roll and half your warrior level to your damage. If you smite an opponent who is not actually a favored foe, there is no additional effect, but the smite use is wasted.
Snatch Arrows	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Deflect Arrows	DESC:Prerequisite: Deflect Arrows.	DESC: When using the Deflect Arrows feat, you may catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use.
Sneak Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:When you make a surprise attack (see Surprise Attack in Chapter Six), you do +2 damage. You cannot surprise attack an opponent you cannot perceive (due to concealment or some other effect), and opponents immune to critical hits suffer no additional damage. Opponents who cannot be surprise attacked are also immune. You can take this feat multiple times, increasing your damage bonus by +1 each time, to a maximum of +5.
Spirited Charge	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Vehicular Combat	DESC:Prerequisite: Vehicular Combat.	DESC: When mounted or on a vehicle and using the charge action, you deal +3 damage with a melee weapon (+4 damage with a lance).
Startle	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can make an Intimidate check rather than a Bluff check to feint in combat. Targets can resist with Intimidate, Sense Motive, or Will and gain a +1 bonus on their resistance check per each additional startle attempt against them in the same encounter.
Stunning Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert.Warrior	DESC:When you make an unarmed attack, you can choose not to inflict normal damage. Instead, the target makes a Fortitude save against a Difficulty of 10 plus your unarmed damage bonus. A successful save results in no effect. A failed save means the target is dazed for one round. Failure by 5 or more means the target is stunned for one round, and failure by 10 or more renders the target unconscious.
Subtle Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:You can use your powers with less chance of notice. When using powers, you can mute their supernatural signature. Characters using Second Sight cannot detect your power use nor can its use be detected later using Second Sight. A subtle power use increases fatigue save Difficulty by +2.
Suggestion	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Fascinate	DESC:Prerequisite: Fascinate (for the same skill).	DESC: You can use an interaction skill to plant a suggestion in the mind of a subject you have fascinated (using the Fascinate feat). This works like a use of the Suggestion power (see Chapter Four), except you must interact with the target. The Difficulty of the target's Will save is 10 + half your expert level + your Charisma score. If you take this as a favored feat and have no expert levels, you use your total levels instead. Likewise, the Suggestion power lasts for 30 minutes per power rank; use your expert levels + 3 in lieu of the power rank for the feat (or your total levels + 3, if you acquired it as a favored feat).
Supernatural Focus	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:Choose one of your powers. You gain a +3 bonus to power checks with that power. You can take this feat more than once. Each time, it applies to a different power.
Supernatural Talent	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:Choose two powers you possess. You gain a +2 bonus to power checks with those powers. You can take this feat more than once. Each time, it applies to a different pair of powers.
Talented	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose two known and related skills, such as Survival and Stealth or Acrobatics and Climb, or two specialties from a specialty skill, such as Craft or Knowledge. You gain a +2 bonus with both skills. You can take this feat multiple times. Each time it applies to two different skills.
Taunt		SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can shake an opponent's confidence with clever taunts. Use a standard action and make a Bluff check against your target's Sense Motive check or Will saving throw, whichever has the higher bonus. If you succeed, your target is shaken for one round (-2 to attack rolls, checks, and saving throws, but not Toughness saves). If you fail, you may try again on the following round. Targets get a +1 on their resistance roll per each additional Bluff attempt against them in the same scene (successful or not).
Tireless	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PRESTAT:1,CON=1	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance	DESC:Prerequisites: Constitution +1, Endurance	DESC: You have tremendous energy reserves. You suffer no penalties from being winded or fatigued, although you still gain fatigue levels normally. This feat has no effect on exhaustion or unconsciousness due to fatigue.
Tough	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:Your Toughness save bonus increases by +1. You can take this feat multiple times and its benefits stack, up to a maximum +5 bonus to your Toughness saves. This bonus stacks with any worn armor or other protection.
Track	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can find and follow tracks left by other creatures. To find tracks or to follow them for one mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check each time the tracks become difficult to follow. You move at half your normal speed while tracking (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The Difficulty depends on the surface, as given on the Surface table.
Trackless	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Prerequisite: Trained in Stealth and Survival.	DESC: If you choose, you leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.
Trailblazer	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Prerequisite: Trained in Survival.	DESC: You can move through any sort of natural surroundings at your normal speed, unimpeded by things like undergrowth, difficult terrain, snow, mud, and similar difficulties. You're still affected by wind, rain, and other weather conditions, however.
Two-Weapon Defense	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Two-Weapon Fighting	DESC:Prerequisite: Two-Weapon Fighting.	DESC: Your two-weapon fighting style improves your Defense. When wielding two weapons (but not while unarmed) and using parry defense, you gain a +1 bonus to your Defense. When using total defense, this bonus increases to +2.
Two-Weapon Fighting	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're more effective fighting with two weapons. You reduce the penalty for doing so by 4 for your primary hand and 6 for your off hand.
Uncanny Dodge	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are especially attuned to potential danger, whether through training, experience, or some innate supernatural talent. You retain your dodge bonus to Defense when surprised, flat-footed, or surprise attacked, so long as you are able to react (are not helpless, bound, unconscious, and the like).
Vehicular Combat	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Prerequisite: Trained in Drive, Pilot, or Ride.	DESC: You know how to maneuver a vehicle or mount in combat. Once each round, if your vehicle or mount would be hit by an attack, you can make a check using the relevant vehicle skill as a reaction to negate the hit. The skill check result must exceed the result of the opponent's attack roll. You can also make a check using the relevant vehicle skill as a full-round action (including the normal operation of the vehicle), in which case the skill result becomes the vehicle or mount's effective Defense for the entire round against all attacks. This feat applies to all vehicular skills in which you are trained.
Wealthy	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are endowed with significant material resources. Each time you select this feat, increase your Wealth bonus by +4.
Weapon Bind	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:If you are using a parry defense and an opponent misses you with an armed melee attack, you can make a disarm attempt immediately as a free action. The disarm attempt is carried out normally, including the attacker getting the opportunity to disarm you (unless you have the Improved Disarm feat).
Weapon Break	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Warrior	DESC:If you are using a parry defense and an opponent misses you with an armed melee attack, you can make an attack against your opponent's weapon immediately as a free action. This requires a normal attack roll and inflicts normal damage to the weapon if it hits (see Sunder in Chapter Six for details).
Weapon Training	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You're trained in the proper use of martial weapons. Characters lacking Weapon Training suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls with martial weapons.
Well-Informed	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Expert	DESC:You are exceptionally well informed. When encountering an individual, group, or organization for the first time, you can make an immediate Gather Information check as a reaction to see if your character has heard something about the subject. This takes the place of a normal Knowledge check (if any). Use the guidelines for Gather Information checks to determine the level of information you gain, and the guidelines for Knowledge checks for the sorts of questions you can answer. See Chapter Two: Skills for details. You receive only one check per subject, although the Narrator may allow another upon encountering the subject again once significant time has passed.
Widen Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Adept	DESC:You can braoden the effect of one of your powers. When using powers that normally affect a single target, you can affect an area with a radius of up to twice your adept level in feet. The power affects all targets in the area normally. You must still meet any requirements for range, including mental contact, that the power requires. Make a single check and compare the results to each target in the area. Targets save individually against the power's effects. The widened power's fatigue Difficulty increases by +6.
