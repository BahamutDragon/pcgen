Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Bard (CBoEM) ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature.Class Feature	DESC:A bard is proficient with all simple weapons. Additionally, the bard is proficient with one of the following weapons: longbow, composite longbow, longsword, rapier, sap, composite short bow, short sword, shortbow, or whip. Bards are proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields. Note that wearing armor heavier than leather gives the bard an armor check penalty on some bard skills (Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble). Double the normal armor check penalty applies to Swim checks. Unlike traditional arcane spellcasters, a bard can cast spellsongs while wearing armor or using a shield, suffering no chance of spellsong failure if the total armor check penalty affecting her is -3 or better. Otherwise, she suffers arcane spellsong failure as normal.	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=WeaponProfSimple|TYPE=ArmorProfMedium|TYPE=ShieldProf
Spellsongs				KEY:Bard (CBoEM) ~ Spellsongs					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature.Bardic Music.Class Feature	DESC:A bard casts arcane spellsongs. Spellsongs are similar to spells, divided into three types: spellnotes, spellchords, and spellmelodies. They all have verbal components, but no somatic or material ones.  Spellnotes are quick, single notes of magical song that can be cast as move actions. That means a bard can perform a standard action in the same round that she casts a spellnote. Spellchords are more complex spellsongs, involving a drawn-out combination of notes. These are cast as standard actions. And they truly are "chords" of song; while most singers can sustain only a single note at a time, bards can sing multiple notes simultaneously (for mundane performances as well as in spellsong casting). Spellmelodies are the most complex spellsongs and take a full round to cast. A bard need not prepare spellsongs beforehand or keep a spellbook. Bards receive bonus spellsongs for high Charisma, as shown in the table below. To cast a spellsong a bard must have a Charisma score of at least 11 for notes, 13 for chords, and 15 for melodies. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard's spellsong is 11 + Charisma modifier for notes, 13 + Charisma modifier for chords, and 15 + Charisma modifier for melodies. Spellnotes can be combined into spellchords, and spellchords can be combined to make spellmelodies. A bard can expend five spellnote slots for the day to create a spellchord, or three spellchord slots to create a spellmelody. Likewise, a single chord slot can power five notes, and using one melody slot, a bard can cast three chords (or 15 notes). Unlike other spellcasters, bards can combine their talents easily to produce powerful magic. Multiple bards can contribute notes, for example, to create a spellchord effect that they all know. The spellsong's effects are based on the highestlevel bard's level and ability score for determining parameters of the spellsong that depend on them (in particular, save Difficulty Classes). Further, if a saving throw is called for, for every two bards involved, the Difficulty Class to resist the spellsong increases by +1.
Bardic Knowledge			KEY:Bard (CBoEM) ~ Bardic Knowledge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature.Class Feature	DESC:A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards. He may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier (+%1) to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.) A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. The DM can determine the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table:;&nl;+%1 Chance to know some relevant knowledge of local notable people, legendary items or noteworthy places;&nl;DC10 common;&nl;DC20 Uncommon but available;&nl;DC25 Obscure;&nl;DC30 Extremely obscure .|BardicKnowledgeBonus 	
Evasion			KEY:Bard (CBoEM) ~ Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature.Class Feature	DESC:At 9th level and up, a bard can dodge and avoid even magical and unusual attacks with agility. If a bard makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally inflicts half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), the bard instead suffers no damage.  Evasion applies only if the bard wears light armor or no armor. A helpless bard (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion
Improved Evasion			KEY:Bard (CBoEM) ~ Improved Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature.Class Feature	DESC:At 17th level, a bard's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, but henceforth she suffers only half damage on a failed save. A helpless bard (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
Weave Melodies			KEY:Bard (CBoEM) ~ Weave Melodies				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature.Bardic Music.Class Feature	DESC:A bard of at least 20th level can expend two spellmelody slots to cast a single spellmelody with one of the following three enhancements (selected prior to casting): 1.
