###Block: Chaositech Stuff -----------------------
# Ability Name					Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							Bonus to HP			Stat bonus					Damage Reduction			Cost
Chaositech - Bone Lacing			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:The surgeon laces the host's bones with metal and hardened, living tissue in a series of four long and painful procedures, requiring a week of recovery time in between each. When finished, the host gains an inherent Strength bonus of +2 and 20 bonus hit points. Further, the host gains damage reduction of 10/slashing or piercing* (his bones are very difficult to break, thus he takes less damage from bludgeoning, crushing, and even falling damage). * Under previous rules, he would take half damage from bludgeoning attacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|20	BONUS:STAT|STR|2				DR:10/Slashing or Piercing	COST:0
Chaositech - Breathers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Implanted in the throat of the host, this set of organs breathes for the host?he no longer breathes through his mouth at all. The breathers can safely process toxic gases of all types. The host becomes immune to inhaled poisons and other attacks that involve dangerous inhalants. Breathers cannot breathe water.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			COST:0
Chaositech - Disease Destroyer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A surgeon places this small organ near the heart. It activates when a virulent disease enters the host's system, destroying the disease (the host need never even make a saving throw against it). It pumps special disease- fighting agents into the bloodstream with great speed. The organ can live within the host for six months and can function up to 20 times during that period before it withers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					COST:0
Chaositech - Dragon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Similar to a serpent implant?, the dragon implant is usually embedded in the host's shoulder or back. It looks like a dragon head and neck, about 3 feet long. The host controls this new appendage, which can bite at foes. The host makes a single attack in a round, using her normal base attack bonus. A dragon attack is a standard action, which can be part of a full attack action, but all the host's attacks suffer a -5 penalty (regardless of any feats she may have). The dragon inflicts 1d6 points of damage (critical hit on a 20/?2), with no bonus for Strength. Even more devastating, three times per day the dragon can breathe a line of fire up to 50 feet long that inflicts 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex save, DC 15, for half). The dragon implant does not have a poisonous bite.																																																																																																																																																																				COST:0
Chaositech - Emitter				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Any type of emitter (see Chapter Two: Bones of Steel) can be placed within a creature of at least size Large, such as within the chest; nonhumanoid creatures may have other potential implant locations, such as the thorax of a drider or the forehead of a giant. The surgeon performing the procedure must have an emitter. The price below covers only the procedure. The emitter draws so much power that the subject suffers 1d4 points of damage each time it is used. Using the emitter implant is a standard action, and it is wielded just as one would use any natural weapon. When the procedure is complete, the emitter protrudes from the host. For 6,000 gp more, the surgeon can conceal the emitter within the creature and enable it to "pop out" when needed with a simple mental command. Another character would need to make a Search check (DC 25) to find the concealed implanted emitter. A host can have no more than one implanted emitter.																																																																																																																																											COST:0
Chaositech - Extra Spine			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Independent of a host, this item appears to be a thin spinal column, as though it had been preserved from a corpse. In an extremely complicated procedure, a chaos surgeon can implant this spine alongside a humanoid creature's existing spine This implant will also work on Medium or Large animals and other creatures, at the DM's discretion. The new spine grants a +4 inherent bonus to Strength. A host can have no more than one extra spine.																																																																																																																																																																																																																		BONUS:STAT|STR|4									COST:0
Chaositech - Fleshworkers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:In a very simple procedure, the host is injected with tiny organisms that reproduce and live within his blood and other fluids. Whenever the host is wounded, the fleshworkers immediately go about cleaning and repairing the wound. The host regenerates 1 hit point per level every hour and 1 point of nonlethal damage per level every five minutes. Fleshworkers are not powerful enough to regenerate limbs or other lost body parts. A host can have no more than one set of fleshworkers of any kind.																																																																																																																																																																																																																				COST:0
Chaositech - Arachnid Covey			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This implant fits just under the host's skin, leaving a hemispherical lump about 3 inches across. The lump has a small opening, from which crawl tiny spiders. The spiders instinctively obey the host's telepathic commands. The most they can do, however, is swarm over one creature that the host touches. A swarmed foe who fails a Will save (DC 16) suffers a -2 circumstance penalty on attacks, saves, and checks from the revulsion and distraction, assuming he is size Huge or smaller (larger foes go unaffected). Further, after a full round, the foe must make a Fortitude save (DC 16) from the cumulative poisonous spider bites. Primary and secondary damage is 1 point of Dexterity. No matter how long the spiders swarm over a foe, the poison is a threat only once. A foe can jump into water (or do something similar) to rid himself of the spiders. Likewise, if he spends a full 3 rounds doing nothing but swatting and brushing away spiders (and defending himself), they are gone. Spiders expelled in this way are gone and no longer respond to the host. If the host does not order them back before the foe deals with them, it takes one week to spawn new ones. To command the spiders to return, the host must touch the target they are swarming. The host cannot have them swarm a new foe until they have returned to the covey for at least 2 rounds. A host can have no more than one arachnid covey.																																																														COST:0
Chaositech - Back-Up Organ			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This implant resembles nothing more than a large slug placed within the body cavity of the host, where it lives like a parasite until needed. When the host sustains a wound so terrible that one of his organs is damaged (a wound that puts him over his massive damage threshold), the creature secretes powerful healing fluids to help heal the wound, then transforms itself into a relative facsimile of the damaged organ, moving into place to replace it. The wound is healed instantly, as if it had never happened, and the host need make no saving throw for the massive damage. The back-up organ functions once, and a host can have only one at a time.																																																																																																																																																																																											COST:0
Chaositech - Fleshworkers (Efficient)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:As with standard fleshworkers, except that the host regenerates 1 hit point per round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								COST:0
Chaositech - Gills				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Usually placed on the throat or otherwise near a creature's windpipe, these artificial organs allow an airbreathing creature to also breathe underwater.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													COST:0
Chaositech - Headclamp				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A chaos surgeon inserts this small device into the temple of a living creature, or otherwise near the brain. The living portions of the device instantly heal the surgical wound, then extend tiny filaments into the host's brain while keeping a small circular opening available on the outside of the head. Numerous non-intrinsic chaositech devices have tubes or other extensions that attach to this opening and clamp into place. This connection allows a device to receive mental commands or to transfer information directly into the host's brain. The headclamp has no intrinsic abilities or benefits. A host can have no more than two headclamps. Should someone attack a headclamp cord, it has an Armor Class of 14 + the host's Dexterity bonus. The DM may also grant the cord any of the host's dodge, deflection, or other Armor Class modifiers, but not armor bonuses, unless the headclamp is a part of the armor (as with animated armor?). The cord has a hardness of 1 and 5 hit points. Headclamp cords are fairly easy to repair (Craft [chaositech]? DC 18), but a device that requires the connection cannot function until the broken cord is repaired. One can pull a cord out of a headclamp with a Strength check (DC 8).																																																																																												COST:0
Chaositech - Heart Plug				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Essentially a suicide device, a heart plug consists of a metal valve inserted into a creature's heart and connected straight to a second valve opening out of the creature's chest. Once in place, the host can, with a mere thought, cause both valves to open, so that the heart pumps his lifeblood straight out of his body. The creature dies in 1d3+1 rounds. Some cruel masters implant heart plugs in their servants, then use a master control device so they can control when the valves open. The master control device has a range of 500 feet and does not require line of sight. This  tactic ensures loyalty among the servants and allows the master to punish those who fail or disobey him. If the valves of a creature's heart plug open but then close again, or if the creature manages to survive the opening in some other fashion, he loses 25 percent of his total hit points for every round the valves were open, but never more than would take him to -9 hp. This implant requires no nutrition.																																																																																																																																		COST:0
Chaositech - Heart Regulator			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This implant allows the host to control her own heart as well as adrenal glands, granting herself a boost of energy and speed when she needs it. The host can, five times per day, take an additional move action during a round (no more than one per round). Further, the host feels so full of energy that any melee attacks she makes during such a round inflict an additional +2 points of damage. The host enjoys a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class during the round as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																									COST:0
Chaositech - Horn					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This implant is a horn of bone and steel, placed on the head, shoulder, arm, or almost anywhere the host desires. The horn can be used in combat: The host makes a single attack in a round, using his normal base attack bonus. Using the horn is a standard action. A host can attack with it as part of a full attack action, but then all his attacks suffer a-5 penalty (regardless of any feats he may have). The horn inflicts damage based on the host's size.																																																																																																																																																																																																																											COST:0
Chaositech - Invader Garrison			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This implant, placed in the host's chest, allows him to secrete through his pores an oily residue teeming with microscopic organisms. If the host touches another creature, the secretion gets on the subject, and the microorganisms make their way across the subject's flesh until they find an orifice to enter, taking 1 full round. Once inside the subject's body, the invaders get into the bloodstream like a disease and establish a "beachhead," unless the subject makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15). Success means the invaders are destroyed. Otherwise, through the garrison implant, the original host maintains communication with the invaders, even if separated up to 100 feet. Through this connection, the host can do any of the following: 1. Influence the subject's emotions, granting the host a +6 competence bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks against the subject. Though unaware of the presence of the invaders, the subject can make a Will saving throw (DC 15) to resist. The host can force the subject to make this saving throw every round. A subject who has failed once cannot resist again. Attempting this influence is a free action for the host. 2. Monitor the subject, so the host always knows the direction, distance, and general physical condition of the subject. No saving throw is allowed the subject. 3. Shock the subject's system, inflicting 1d4 points of Constitution damage. This tactic kills the invaders as well. The subject can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 15) for half damage. The invaders are flushed from the subject's system after eight hours. The garrison produces a new set of invaders once per day.																					COST:0
Chaositech - Misting Spray (Acid)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A small tube connected to an internal sac of thin liquid is placed within the host's wrist or fingertip. As a standard action, the host can spray out a fine mist of the liquid in a cloud 10 feet across, the edge of which must be adjacent to the host. Organs within the sac produce enough liquid for the host to use the mist five times per day. There are three different types of mist, each requiring a different implant - 1. Acidic Mist. Anyone in the cloud suffers 3d6 points of acid damage (Reflex save, DC 15, for half). The cloud disperses after 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																																										COST:0
Chaositech - Misting Spray (Confusion)	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A small tube connected to an internal sac of thin liquid is placed within the host's wrist or fingertip. As a standard action, the host can spray out a fine mist of the liquid in a cloud 10 feet across, the edge of which must be adjacent to the host. Organs within the sac produce enough liquid for the host to use the mist five times per day. There are three different types of mist, each requiring a different implant - 2. Confusing Mist. Not only does the mist form a swirling dark vortex around those within it, but it contains mind-affecting chemicals that cause confusion and stupor. Anyone within the cloud, which lasts for 1d4 rounds, is effectively blind, but also has full concealment. Further, those in the cloud must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or find themselves unable to act other than to defend themselves (as though dazed) for 1d4 rounds, whether they are still within the cloud or not.																																																																																																																																																COST:0
Chaositech - Misting Spray (Sleep)		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A small tube connected to an internal sac of thin liquid is placed within the host's wrist or fingertip. As a standard action, the host can spray out a fine mist of the liquid in a cloud 10 feet across, the edge of which must be adjacent to the host. Organs within the sac produce enough liquid for the host to use the mist five times per day. There are three different types of mist, each requiring a different implant - 3. Sleep Mist. Anyone in the cloud must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or fall asleep for 10 + 1d4 rounds. This sleep is a normal slumber; a loud noise or jostling easily awakens a victim after the first round. The cloud disperses after 1 round.																																																																																																																																																																																								COST:0
Chaositech - Muscle Lacing			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:The surgeon adds various types of fibers, both organic and inorganic, to vital muscle strands throughout the subject's body. This painful and long process requires four different operations, calling for a week of recovery time in between each. Once complete, the procedures grant a +4 inherent bonus to Strength and a +2 inherent bonus to Constitution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BONUS:STAT|STR|4	BONUS:STAT|CON|2						COST:0
Chaositech - Pocket				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A chaos surgeon adds an extra fold of flesh to the leg, hip, stomach, chest, or back of a creature, creating a secret pouch or pocket that can store small, flat objects no more than 6 inches across. Another character must make a Search check (DC 20) to find the pocket and its contents.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							COST:0
Chaositech - Poison Neutralizer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This small organ is placed near the heart, activating when a toxin enters the host's system. It pumps antitoxins into the bloodstream with great speed, destroying any poison (the host need not even make a saving throw). The organ can live within the host for six months and function up to 20 times during that period before it withers.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															COST:0
Chaositech - Psionic Tendrils			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A chaos surgeon adds these organic tendrils to a host's head. Frequently, the tendrils are attached to the chin, but the forehead and even the inside of the mouth are other possible implantation spots. At rest, they appear to be fleshy extensions 2 inches long and a quarter of an inch wide that hang limply. When the host desires it, however, they lengthen to reach any adjacent creature. The host must (as a standard action, not as part of a full attack action) make a touch attack to attach the tendrils to a subject. Anyone so touched must make a Fortitude save (DC 18) to resist the even tinier threadlike filaments that extend from the tendrils to reach into any available orifice (nose, mouth, ear, eyes). The subject must be a living creature with an Intelligence score above 1 and not immune to mind-affecting attacks. Once the filaments are inside, the host can use them to implant a suggestion or to probe the creature's mind; the subject can make a Will save (DC 18) to resist either. The filament probe allows the host to basically "ask" the subject one question that can be answered in 10 words or less. If the subject knows the answer and fails the Will save, the host gains the answer. The host can ask one question per round, but doing so is a full-round action. Should the host suffer any damage during this time																																																																									COST:0
Chaositech - Serpent				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This strange addition, usually implanted in the host's shoulder or back, looks like a serpent about 3 feet long, with fangs. The host controls this new appendage, which can bite at foes. To do so, the host makes a single attack in a round, using his normal base attack bonus. Attacking with the serpent is a standard action the host can use as part of a full attack action, but then all his attacks suffer a -5 penalty (regardless of any feats he may have). The serpent inflicts 1d6 points of damage (critical hit on a 20/?2), with no bonus for Strength. It also bears a venom that can be used up to six times per day before depleting the self-generating stores. The poison has DC 14 and inflicts 1d3 points of Constitution primary and secondary damage.																																																																																																																																																																									COST:0
Chaositech - Spinal Clamp			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Similar to a headclamp, this small device attaches to a creature's spine, usually near the base of the spinal column. The living portions of the device instantly heal the surgical wound, then extend tiny filaments into the host's spine while keeping a small circular opening available outside the body, on the creature's back. The host can insert a tube or cord connected to a non-intrinsic chaositech device into this opening, then clamp it into place. This powers a device from the host's own personal energy rather than raw chaos. This tactic effectively changes a non-intrinsic device into an intrinsic one, so the user need not worry about chaotic failure. However, each time the user normally would have checked for chaotic failure with the chaositech device, she suffers 1 point of Constitution damage. She also suffers 1d2 points of Constitution damage when the device is first connected to the clamp. It requires a full-round action to hook a device into a spinal clamp, as well as a full-round action to disconnect the device to use it normally. A host can have no more than one spinal clamp. Should someone attack a spinal clamp cord, it has an Armor Class of 14 + the host's Dexterity bonus. The DM may also grant the cord any of the host's dodge, deflection, or other Armor Class modifiers, but not armor bonuses. The cord has a hardness of 1 and 5 hit points. Spinal clamp cords are fairly easy to repair (Craft [chaositech]? DC 18), but a device that requires the connection cannot function until the broken cord is repaired. One can pull a cord out of a spinal clamp with a Strength check (DC 8). The spinal clamp has no intrinsic abilities or benefits.																COST:0
Chaositech - Stamina Booster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This organ is implanted into a host's neck. It feeds nutrients and chemicals into the body continually, improving the host's overall health, stamina, and resistance to disease and poison. The host gains an inherent +2 bonus to Constitution.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															COST:0
Chaositech - Tail					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:The procedure grants the host a prehensile tail about 3 feet long. The muscular tail provides a +4 competence bonus to Balance and Climb checks. The host can use the tail to make off-hand whip attacks, although he is still limited to the normal number of off-hand attacks (usually one). The benefit, of course, is that the host could make an "off-hand" attack with his tail and still use a two-handed weapon, a weapon and a shield, and so on. These whip attacks must be made against adjacent foes. A host can have no more than one tail implant.																																																																																																																																																																																																												COST:0
Chaositech - Tail (Poisonous)			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:This tail is just like the one described above, except the tip bears a small venomous stinger and venom reservoir, enabling each strike to also inject a dose of poison in the target up to six times per day. The price of the procedure depends on the type of poison (the poison's Difficulty Class and damage).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			COST:0
Chaositech - Tentacle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:The host gains a tentacle approximately 3 feet long. This tentacle is normally attached at the shoulder, the hip, or on one of his arms. The tentacle is muscular (it has the same Strength as the host) and grants a +4 competence bonus to Climb checks. It can grasp objects, effectively becoming an additional limb for the host?even to wield a light weapon, although it inflicts no damage in an unarmed attack. The host can use the tentacle to make off-hand attacks, although he is still limited to his normal number of off-hand attacks (usually one). The tentacle also can hold a shield. A host can have no more than two tentacle implants.																																																																																																																																																																																												COST:0
Chaositech - Translator				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A chaos surgeon implants this organ near the back of the host's neck (or otherwise near the brain and ear). It allows the host to understand the basics of any spoken language, if not always the subtle nuances. The organ transmits impulses directly into the host's brain as it receives the sounds. The host cannot use the translator to speak in a language he does not know, nor does it help with reading other languages or dealing with nonverbal communication. As the organ works on a somewhat telepathic level, the speaker must understand what she is saying in the language to be translated?it's not enough to simply read an unknown language out loud.																																																																																																																																																																																										COST:0
Chaositech - Vigor Organ			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:A chaos surgeon implants this organ in the gut of the host. Once per day, at the host's mental command, it pumps powerful chemicals into his bloodstream that grant him enhanced strength and stamina for a short time. The host gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution for one minute.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	COST:0
Chaositech - Web Spinneret			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Chaositech	DESC:Placed within a host's wrist, this attachment is small and almost unnoticeable. A Search check (DC 25) is needed to find an implanted spinneret. Four times per day, the subject can spray forth strands of spidersilk that he can weave into a web identical to the effect of a web spell cast by a 5th-level caster (DC 14).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		COST:0
