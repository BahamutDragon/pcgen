A green ray springs from the staff to strike the holder. If the caster succeeds at a Will save (DC 19), nothing else happens. If she fails, she is transported to a location designated by the creator, such as a dungeon, or a cage in the unseelie queen's court.

Once a day, when activated with a command word, this basket fills with all manner of ripe, delicious-looking fruit, sufficient to feed three adult humans for one day. One piece of fruit is specially tainted and exceptionally beautiful. A creature that comes within 10 feet of the basket experiences a suggestion that it immediately eat the pretty fruit (DC 22 Will save negates). A creature that comes within 10 feet of the basket experiences a suggestion that it immediately eat the pretty fruit (DC 22 Will save negates); once a creature has made a successful save against this effect, it cannot be affected by the suggestion power of the same basket of tainted delights for one day. Creatures that bite into the fruit must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall into a state of temporal stasis, which functions as though cast by a 15th-level caster. After the tainted fruit is bitten into or one day passes, the fruit becomes nonmagical. The owner of the basket is immune to the allure of the tainted fruit and knows which piece it is.

She remained in that state until the master's dog wandered into the library. When the canine brushed the statue, the spell transferred to him, and the dog became stone, freeing the servant. This pattern continues, so whenever a living creature of medium or large size (including invisible creatures) touches the statue, the trapped creature becomes free and the new creature turns to stone. The statue can be indoors or outside, such as in a garden or mausoleum.

Gray Portrait							TYPE:Magic.Artifact		COST:0	WT:10											SOURCEPAGE:Magic of Delight and Despair												SPROP:Initially only a blank canvas, a gray portrait becomes a picture of the owner after one week. After this time, it magically absorbs all the negative effects of aging and prevents the owner from dying of old age. If the portrait is destroyed, the owner immediately suffers all the negative effects of age and instantly dies if he has outlived his natural lifespan. If the owner is killed by any means, the canvas becomes blank again.
Harp of Shimmering Beauty					TYPE:Magic.Artifact		COST:0	WT:15											SOURCEPAGE:Fey Kelir Magics														SPROP:When played, this powerful artifact creates a swarm of burrowing insects that are capable of understanding a simple mental command to search for and infest a single creature. To the casual observer, these insects appear to be scarlet red maggoty creatures with sharp mandibles that wiggle through the air until they locate their target. However, this vile mien is mere illusion. If a creature makes a Will save (DC 20), it sees small, fluttering butterflies in a rainbow of colors. Those seeing the butterflies for what they really are must make another Will save (DC 25) or become fascinated by them.  The player of the harp sends the swarm after a single individual and it will unerringly seek out its target (as long as it is on the same plane). Once the harpist selects a subject, she has no further control over the swarm; however, the harpist is continually aware of the condition and location of the swarm as if she had cast a status spell on it. If the swarm reaches and touches its intended target (and only its target), the harpist can take control of the creature. The target must succeed on a Will save (DC 19+ Cha modifier of the harpist) or fall instantly under the harpist's influence as though by a dominate monster spell (caster level 20th). The harpist can dominate a number of creatures equal to her Charisma modifier. Attempting to control an additional creature automatically releases the victim who was longest under the control of the harpist. The harp cannot create a second swarm while the first one exists. A shimmer swarm dissipates 5 rounds after first touching its target or after a year and a day.
Kira's Necklace							TYPE:Magic.Artifact		COST:0	WT:0											SOURCEPAGE:Magic of Delight and Despair												SPROP:This necklace, when touched by a creature with an Intelligence of 9 or higher, drains 1 point of Intelligence from the creature upon contact.

The necklace is an intelligent item, base scores: AL NE; Int 10, Wis 18, Cha 18, blindsense and hearing; Ego score 22. Its Intelligence and Ego increase as more victims touch it. Victims lose 1 point of Intelligence per wearing -- that is, as long as the victim keeps the necklace on, it does not continue to drain Intelligence unless removed and worn again later. Destroying the necklace restores the lost Intelligence to its victims.
