# Abilities
Acid Flesh (Ex): The skin of a bile wrapped in beauty oozes a highly acidic pus. Merely touching or being touched by the creature automatically deals 2d6 points of acid damage. A metal weapon that deals damage to a bile wrapped in beauty takes 4d6 points of acid damage with no saving throw. Wooden, stone, and other nonmetallic weapons are unaffected.

Acid Spray (Ex): Once per day, a bile wrapped in beauty can spray acid in a 20-foot cone, dealing 4d6 points of acid damage to everything in the area.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a bile wrapped in beauty must hit a creature one size larger, the same size, or smaller than itself with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold.

Mending (Sp): At will, a bile wrapped in beauty can use mending per the spell.

Reflective Disguise (Sp): At will, a bile wrapped in beauty can use reflective disguise as per the spell (see below).

# Abilities
Fire Volley (Su): Whenever two or more calientos are within 30 feet of each other, they can work together to create a fiery blast. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one contributing caliento. The fire deals 2d8 points of fire damage for each calientos contributing to it, to a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC 10 the number of calientos contributing) reduces the damage by half.

Heat (Ex): Merely touching or being touched by a caliento automatically deals 2d6 points of fire damage.

Hive Mind (Ex): Calientos are all part of a communal consciousness. This shared consciousness facilitates communication between calientos near and far, and contains the memories of their entire species. A group of calientos within 30 feet of each other are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No caliento in a group is considered flanked unless all are.

Vulnerability to Cold (Ex):A caliento is vulnerable to cold. It takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal form cold effects, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or whether the save succeeds or fails.

Skills: Calientos use their Dexterity modifier instead of their Strength modifier for Climb checks.

*In desert areas, calientos gain a +4 racial bonus to Hide checks due to their coloration.

Deep Slumber (Su): A sleeping blossom sprite swarm attack often causes creatures to fall asleep. Any living creature that begins its turn with a sleeping blossom sprite swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be affected as though by a deep slumber spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Swarm Traits:A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm comprising Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the swarm to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple another.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a -10 penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of wind spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of subdual damage to the swarm per spell level (or Hit Die of the originating creature, in the case of effects such as an air elemental's whirlwind).

A swarm rendered unconscious by means of subdual damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit points exceed its subdual damage.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to the swarm's damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 15 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even with a successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration requires a Concentration check (DC 20). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Glide: Forestfolk are not true flyers. A forestfolk always must dive at least 10 feet when using a move action to fly; if the forestfolk makes a double move, she must dive 20 feet (10 feet per move). The forestfolk flying speed doubles when it dives, just like any other flying creature with average maneuverability.

Hunting Cry (Su): A forestfolk can emit a high piercing shriek that can damage and paralyze its prey. 30-foot cone, once every 2d4 rounds, damage 2d4 sonic plus paralysis for 1d4+1 rounds, Fortitude save DC 13 halves damage and negates paralysis. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same forestfolk's hunting cry for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Skills: A forestfolk receives a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. *A forestfolk gains a +8 bonus on Hide checks in forests or overgrown areas.

Chilling Breath (Su): 30-ft. cone, every 2d6 rounds, 6d6 cold, Reflex DC 20 half. The DC is Constitution-based.

Consuming Cold (Su): Supernatural disease -- touch, Fortitude DC 20, incubation period 1 minute; damage 1d4 Con and 1d4 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Unlike normal diseases, consuming cold continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured. An afflicted fey that dies of consuming cold becomes a hoarfroster a year and a day after death. Other creatures simply die, and their bodies slowly disintegrate over the next year, along with any clothing or items touching the body.

During the metamorphosis, a fey creature lies dead, but all of the creature's hair or fur gradually fades to white, while its skin changes to an icy blue hue. A hoarfroster retains its basic facial features, but all previous memories, thoughts and skills are completely gone and can never be regained. Any clothing or items touching the creature turn to dust.

Fatiguing Touch (Su): A hoarfroster's touch is tiring. A victim touched by it must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or become fatigued. A creature already fatigued becomes exhausted. The save is Charisma-based.

Incorporeal Traits: A hoarfroster is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50%% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.

Construct Traits: A throne guardian is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A throne guardian has darkvision (60-foot range).

Detect Thoughts (Su): A throne guardian can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 20th; save DC 25). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

Etherealness (Su): This ability functions just like the spell of the same name (caster level 20th).

Fast Healing (Ex): A throne construct regains lost hit points at the rate of 10- per round. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow the throne construct to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Guard (Ex): The throne guardian moves swiftly to interpose parts of itself to protect its seated master by blocking blows and disrupting foes. Each attack against the seated controller takes a -2 penalty.

Plane Shift (Su): This ability functions just like the spell of the same name (caster level 20th).

Shield Other (Sp): The designated controller of the throne can activate this defensive ability if within 100 feet of the throne guardian. If the controller is seated in the throne, the ability is always active. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the guardian half the damage that would otherwise be dealt to the master.

Spell Storing (Sp): The throne guardian can store one spell of 9th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded by its master or when a predetermined situation arises. If seated in the throne, the master can opt to have the spell affect her as well. Once the spell is used, it can store another spell (or the same spell). The fey queens usually have time stop stored in their throne guardians.

Telepathy (Su): A throne guardian can communicate telepathically with its master.

True Seeing (Su): Throne guardians continuously use true seeing as the divine spell (caster level 12th).
