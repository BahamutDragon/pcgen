Animate Dead Familiar					CLASSES:Wizard=5			SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Evil			COMPS:V S XP	CASTTIME:1 round		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Corpse Touched										DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.1	DESC:Returns your familiar to you in a zombie-like state|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:In order to cast this spell, you must have a familiar, and that creature must be dead. You animate the dead familiar as a zombielike undead, restoring some measure of the bond you had with it while it lived. You do not regain the experience points you lost when the familiar died. You also lose the special benefits you gained based on the familiar's animal type (such as the +2 bonus to Move Silently checks bestowed by a cat familiar). Being undead, the creature has no Constitution score, which affects its Fortitude saves but not its hit points. It retains its natural armor and its preternatural Intelligence, as well as all of the special abilities it had based on your level except for the ability to speak with animals of its type. It still has effective Hit Dice equal to your level and hit points equal to half your total hit points. The undead familiar resembles a zombie, but is not slow like a zombie. Its type changes to Undead. As an undead creature, it is immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. It is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. If you are within range of the familiar's empathic link with you (one mile), it cannot be turned or rebuked. Beyond that range, it is subject to turning and rebuking (as well as commanding and destroying) as an undead of its effective Hit Dice. In addition, the familiar gains a special attack delivered by a melee attack. The nature of this attack depends on your caster level at the time you cast this spell; it does not improve as your level increases. You may choose a lower-level ability than your level indicates. &nl;9-10 Paralysis: Those hit by the undead familiar's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+2 minutes. Elves are immune to this paralysis. &nl;11-14 Strength damage: The undead familiar's attack deals 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage in addition to the normal damage. &nl;15-18 Energy Drain: Living creatures hit by the undead familiar's attack receive one negative level. The Fortitude save to remove the negative level has a DC of 16. &nl;19-20 Constitution Drain: Living creatures hit by the undead familiar's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or suffer 1d6 points of permanent Constitution drain. &nl;If the undead familiar is destroyed, you lose experience points as if you had lost a living familiar (again). The corpse is utterly destroyed in this case, and cannot be animated via this spell again, nor can it be restored to life with a raise dead spell (resurrection will work, however). You cannot cast this spell on another character's familiar. XP Cost: 100 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Arcane Bolt							CLASSES:Wizard=1			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force			COMPS:V S		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to 5 creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart		DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Reflex half				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:Shoots ((CASTERLEVEL+1)/2,5) bolts of force inflicting 1d6+1 damage each|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:A bolt of magical energy shoots forth from your fingertips at its target, dealing 1d6+1 points of damage. For every two levels of experience past 1st, you gain an additional bolt, which you fire at the same time. You have two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, and the maximum of five bolts at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple bolts, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single bolt can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you roll for SR or roll damage. This spell counts as magic missile for spell, items, or special qualities that protect a target from magic missile, such as a brooch of shielding and shield.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Werebear					CLASSES:Druid=8|Wizard=9	SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S M		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:You take on the qualities of a brown bear|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:You take on certain qualities of a brown bear, almost as though you were a werebear in hybrid form (if werebears had hybrid forms). You gain a +16 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, a +2 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score, and a +8 enhancement bonus to your Constitution score. Your face becomes that of a bear and your hands become massive paws with sharp claws. These paws burden you with a 25%% spell failure chance when you cast any spell with a somatic component (even a divine spell). You can attack with both claws at your full base attack bonus and your bite at only 2 from your full attack bonus (as if you had the Multiattack feat). The claws deal 1d8 points of damage each (1d6 if you are Small), and the bite deals 2d8 (2d6 if you are Small). You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats as well, and a +7 natural armor bonus. Material Component: Hair from a werebear.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your Strength score and a +6 enhancement bonus to your Constitution score. Your face becomes that of a boar, and you can attack with your tusks if you choose, dealing 1d8 points of damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small) on a hit. You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight feat as well, and a +8 natural armor bonus. Material Component: Hair from a wereboar.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score and a +2 enhancement bonus to your Constitution score. You gain a +3 natural armor bonus as your hide thickens and sprouts extra hair. Your face lengthens into a ratlike snout, and you can attack with your bite as a natural weapon without provoking an attack of opportunity. The bite deals 1d4 points of damage, or 1d3 points if you are Small. You also gain the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat with your bite attack.

You gain a +12 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, a +4 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score, and a +6 enhancement bonus to your Constitution score. Your face lengthens into a tigerlike muzzle and your fingernails grow into sharp claws. You can attack with both claws at your full base attack bonus and your bite at only 2 from your full attack bonus (as if you had the Multiattack feat). The claws deal 1d8 points of damage each (1d6 if you are Small), and the bite deals 2d6 (2d4 if you are Small). You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats as well, and a +5 natural armor bonus. Material Component: Hair from a weretiger.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Werewolf					CLASSES:Druid=4|Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S M		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:You take on the qualities of a wolf|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:You take on certain qualities of a wolf, almost as though you were a werewolf in hybrid form. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, a +4 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score, and a +4 enhancement bonus to your Constitution score.

You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight feat as well, and a +4 natural armor bonus. Material Component: Hair from a werewolf.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bladesong							CLASSES:Bard,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S F		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Weapon touched										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:Will negates [harmless, object]	SPELLRES:Yes [harmless, object]	SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:You can make a single additional touch attack with the sword as a free action|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Bladesong makes a bladed weapon emit magical music in combat. Any round that the weapon is used in melee combat, this spell allows the wielder to make a single, additional touch attack with the sword as a free action. The attack uses the wielder's normal attack bonus with that weapon but inflicts no damage. Instead, anyone successfully touched by the weapon in this way is dazed for one round. Dazed characters cannot take actions but can defend themselves normally. Focus: The weapon.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Delay Disease						CLASSES:Cleric=2			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Healing							COMPS:V S DF	CASTTIME:1 full round	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature Touched										DURATION:1 day						SAVEINFO:Will negates [harmless]		SPELLRES:Yes [harmless]			SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:Subject becomes temporarily immune to disease|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:The subject becomes temporarily immune to the ravages of disease. The progress of any nonmagical disease that already afflicts the target is halted for the duration of the spell. Delay disease allows the subject to skip the required saving throw against the disease for the day that the spell is in effect. During this period, the subject accrues no further ability damage from the disease. A skipped saving throw counts as neither a success nor a failure for the purpose of recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the incubation period of any disease to which the subject is exposed during the spell's duration does not begin until the spell expires. Delay disease does not cure any damage that a disease may already have dealt, and it has no effect against magical or supernatural diseases.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dirge of Discord						CLASSES:Cleric=5			SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Chaos|Sonic		COMPS:V S F		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:30-ft radius spread									DURATION:2d4 rounds + (CASTERLEVEL) rounds	SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:Target suffers a -4 to attack and concentration ckecks, -8 to effective Dexterity|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:This spell creates an unholy, chaotic dirge that fills the subject's head with the screams of the dying, the wailing of the damned, and the howling of the mad. Affected creatures suffer a -4 profane penalty to attack rolls and Concentration checks, a -8 enhancement penalty to effective Dexterity (with Reflex saves reduced accordingly for the spell's duration), and halved movement due to the subject's equilibrium being thrown off by the dirge. Focus: A tiny urn containing some ashes of a destrachan.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divine Interdiction					CLASSES:Cleric=4			SCHOOL:Abjuration											COMPS:V S DF	CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:10-ft radius emanation centered on object, creature or point in space	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:Will negates or none [object]	SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.5	DESC:Interfears with turn and rebuke abilities|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:ivine interdiction interferes with a cleric's connection to his or her divine source of power, resulting in a temporary loss of the ability to turn or rebuke undead. Paladins, blackguards, and other classes capable of rebuking, turning, or otherwise commanding the undead can also suffer a temporary loss of this ability through divine interdiction. This spell creates a beam of invisible disruptive energy that streaks out from the caster's pointed finger to strike the target(s) automatically. As usual, a target benefits only from his or her size modifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any); armor bonuses, shield bonuses, or natural armor bonus do not apply. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use SR, if any. Should the save fail, the target's turning abilities are immediately negated for the spell's duration. While under the influence of divine interdiction, the target is treated as though he or she has no ability to turn, rebuke, or command undead. Note that the spell does not prevent positive or negative energy from affecting undead within the area (it merely becomes a barrier to activating such powers).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Elemental Familiar					CLASSES:Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S M XP	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Living creature touched									DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates [harmless]	SPELLRES:Yes [harmless]			SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:Living familiar becomes elemental|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:In order to cast this spell, you must have a familiar. When you cast the spell, the target creature becomes a Tiny air, earth, fire, or water elemental, as detailed below. You choose what type of elemental the creature becomes. The creature retains its basic shape, but it is in every way an elemental, not an element creature (as described in Manual of the Planes). You lose any special ability the familiar previously granted to you (such as the +2 bonus to Move Silently checks bestowed by a cat familiar). However, you gain a replacement special ability, depending on the type of elemental your familiar becomes: Air -- Master gains a +2 bonus to Initiative checks (stacks with Improved Initiative). Earth -- Master gains +1 natural armor. Fire -- Master gains a +3 resistance bonus to saving throws against fire attacks. Water -- Master gains a +1 resistance bonus to Fortitude saving throws. Only a limited wish, miracle, or wish or similar magic can restore a transmuted familiar to its original state. Otherwise, the familiar remains an elemental forevermore. You cannot cast this spell on another character's familiar. Most creatures consider the transformation harmless and beneficial, but if the creature decides to resist, a successful Fortitude save negates the spell. Material Component: A small quantity of air, earth, fire, or water, depending on the elemental type the creature is to become. XP Cost: 500 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Exacting Shot						CLASSES:Ranger=1			SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Ranged weapon touched									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:All critical rolls against favored enemy automatically succeed|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:This transmutation makes a ranged (projectile) weapon strike true against the caster's favored enemies. All critical rolls against favored enemies automatically succeed, so every threat is a critical hit. The affected weapon also negates any miss chance due to concealment whenever the caster fires at a favored enemy (unless it has total concealment, in which case the normal miss chance applies). If the ranged weapon or the projectile fired has any magical effect or property related to critical hits, this spell has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fearsome Grapple						CLASSES:Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:Personal											DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:Two extra arms grow on you|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:This spell causes two additional arms to grow from your sides and coordinate their efforts to help you grapple another creature. These extra arms give you a +4 circumstance bonus to grapple checks you make while the spell is in effect. The arms are not coordinated enough to wield weapons, manipulate tools, or perform any action other than grappling. If your caster level is at least 9th, you grow four additional arms, and the circumstance bonus increases to +8. Note: If you use this spell in your game, all creatures with more than two arms should gain a circumstance bonus to grapple checks, as suggested in Sword &amp; Fist. This bonus is +4 per extra pair of arms, and is the same bonus granted by the spell (not an additional bonus).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Foebane							CLASSES:Ranger=4			SCHOOL:Evocation											COMPS:V S		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Weapon touched										DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:Weapon acts as a +5 magic weapon dealing +2d6 damage against one favored enemy|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:This spell imbues one of the caster's weapons with great killing power against a single favored enemy type. Against creatures of that type, the weapon acts as a +5 magic weapon and deals +2d6 points of bonus damage. Furthermore, while the caster wields the weapon, he or she gains a +4 resistance bonus to saving throws against effects created by creatures of that type. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves the caster's hand for any reason. The caster cannot have more than one foebane weapon at a time. If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with exacting shot or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. Note: A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The creature gets a +20 competence bonus on a single skill check and must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heal Animal Companion					CLASSES:Ranger=3|Druid=5	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Healing							COMPS:V S		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Caster's animal companion touched							DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes [harmless]			SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Cures disease, blindness, deafness, insanity, temp ability damage, and all damage|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Heal animal companion enables the caster to wipe away disease and injury in one of his or her own animal companions (gained via class feature or the animal friendship spell). It completely cures all diseases, blindness, or deafness of the animal companion, cures all points of damage suffered due to wounds or injury, and repairs temporary ability damage. It cures mental disorders caused by spells or injury to the brain. Heal animal companion does not remove negative levels, restore drained levels, or restore drained ability scores.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hemorrhage							CLASSES:Cleric=1			SCHOOL:Necromancy											COMPS:V S DF	CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched										DURATION:((CASTERLEVEL/2),5) rounds			SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Inflict 1d3 points of damage each round|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Your touch inflicts a deep, painful wound that bleeds profusely and refuses to heal. The target takes 1d3 points of damage per round from bleeding until the spell's duration expires. Nonmagical healing neither stops the blood loss nor restores hit points lost from such bleeding. A cure spell restores hit points normally but does not stop the bleeding. A styptic or heal spell both stops the bleeding and restores lost hit points as it normally would. Hemorrhage is countered by styptic.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hindsight							CLASSES:Bard=6|Wizard=9		SCHOOL:Divination											COMPS:V S F		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:0		TARGETAREA:60 ft. radius										DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:You can see and hear into the past of your area|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:You can see and hear into the past of your current location. The level of detail you see and hear via this spell depends on the span of time you wish to observe; concentrating on a span of days during the past renders a more detailed perspective than, say, a span of centuries. Chose a span of time from the options below: Days: You clearly see the events of one day per caster level. You gain detailed knowledge of the people, conversations, and events that transpired. Weeks: You gain a detailed summary of the events of one week per caster level. Exact wording and details are lost, but you know all of the participants and the highlights of the conversations and events. Years: You gain a general idea of the events of one year per caster level. You notice only noteworthy events such as deaths, battles, scenes of great emotion, important discoveries, and significant happenings. Centuries: You gain the general idea of the events of one century plus an additional century for every four levels of experience past 1st level. For instance, a 16th-level caster would gain insight into four centuries, and a 17th-level caster would see five centuries. You notice only the most remarkable of events: coronations, deaths of important personages, major battles, and other truly awesome happenings. The following spells can be used in conjunction with a hindsight spell: darkvision, detect magic, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, read magic, see invisibility, tongues, and true seeing. Focus: An hourglass-shaped diamond worth at least 5,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Leomund's Hidden Lodge		KEY:Hidden Lodge	CLASSES:Wizard=5			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V S M F	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:20 ft. square structure									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*2) hours			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:As Secure Shelter, except that the sturcture is perfectly camoflaged|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:This spell is similar to Leomund's Secure Shelter, except that the conjured structure is perfectly camouflaged to blend in with whatever terrain or surroundings are appropriate. It may appear as a house-sized boulder in mountainous or rocky areas, a sand dune, a deadfall, a small grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The spell also conceals all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within the lodge. Creatures examining the lodge or studying its immediate vicinity note the presence and extent of the shelter with a successful Wilderness Lore check (DC 30). If the lodge's occupants are seen entering or leaving the lodge, the DC for this check drops to 10.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Master's Touch						CLASSES:Bard,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Divination											COMPS:V F		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Self		TARGETAREA:Self												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:P.11	DESC:Grants proficiency with a specific weapon|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Master's touch is a spell often found in the repertoire of the adventurers that specialize in casting arcane spells. It grants casters the knowledge and experience to claim proficiency in whatever single weapon or shield they hold in their hands when the spell is cast. The lack of a somatic component means the spell may be cast in the midst of a fight while keeping ready whatever items stand between the caster and danger. Proficiency is granted for only a single, specific item, although multiple castings allow for multiple proficiencies. For example, a sorcerer holding a short sword and rapier, with a buckler strapped to his off hand, could cast the spell three times, once for each weapon and shield. Note that this spell does not grant proficiency for a class of item, but only for the one specific item held in the hand at the time the spell is cast. Should the caster set that item down or otherwise lose his or her grip on it, proficiency does not fade away; the proficiency is due to knowledge gained, not due to any transmutation of the caster or the item. The caster may therefore recover that specific item and continue to use it with proficiency until the spell's effect runs out. Master's touch does not convey any information about a magic item to the caster. The caster may not even be aware that an item is magical at all. Arcane Focus: The item in whose use the caster wishes to be proficient.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mindless Rage						CLASSES:Bard,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V S F		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One person or creature									DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.11	DESC:Target must engage caster in physical combat.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Creatures affected by the spell mindless rage become so filled with rage that they can do nothing but focus on engaging the caster in personal physical combat. The affected creature cannot use any spells, spell-like or supernatural abilities, or ranged weapons while attacking the caster. The subject's only thoughts are of killing the caster -- if not with bare hands, then with a hand-held melee weapon at best. It's worth noting that the recipient of this spell, though overcome with rage, is by no means rendered an idiot or suicidal. For example, an affected creature will not charge off a cliff in an attempt to reach the target. While under the effect of a mindless rage spell, the subject can make use of all normal melee combat skills, abilities, and feats -- either offensive or defensive. However, the affected creature cannot use any ability that requires activation or concentration. An interesting side effect of mindless rage occurs when the spell is cast upon any character capable of the rage ability (such as a barbarian). In these cases, the mindless rage episode counts as one of the character's uses of rage for that day. Mindless rage is a fairly uncommon spell. It's believed to have been developed by dwarven fighter/wizards who preferred to face their opponents in melee combat over magical conflicts. Of course, many of the stories tracing this spell's origins to the battle-mages also note that this dwarven method of ensuring melee combat against spellcasters backfired when the group ran afoul of a band of sorcerer/barbarians. Arcane Focus: Successful casting of mindless rage requires the caster to utilize a scarlet handkerchief or similar piece of cloth, which is waved in the target's direction while the caster vocalizes the verbal component.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mirror Move							CLASSES:Bard,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S M		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) minutes			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:Reproduces any physical general feat that you observed within the last 10 rounds|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Mirror move allows you to reproduce any general feat with an obvious physical effect that you observed another perform within the past 10 rounds, providing you meet the prerequisites for that feat. For example, Mialee is proficient with the shortbow but does not possess the Point Blank Shot feat. However, she can watch Soveliss perform the feat, then, using mirror move, she can mimic his Point Blank Shot feat to better attack an orc advancing on her. When the spell dissipates, Mialee can no longer access this feat (unless she later acquires it herself or recasts mirror move for the same effect). With a single casting, you may mirror move a number of feats equal to your Intelligence bonus, but always at least one. That is, a caster with an Intelligence of 10 can mirror one feat, while a caster with 18 Intelligence can mirror up to four feats with a single use of the spell. The effects of multiple castings of mirror move do not stack. Each new casting wipes out the previous one. The DM may allow mirroring of feats from sources other than the Player's Handbook, as long as they are feats with observable physical effects. Spellcasters who do not meet the prerequisite(s) for the feat they wish to mirror can sometimes find clever ways around this limitation. For example, Mialee has the Improved Unarmed Strike feat but a Dexterity of only 11. She casts cat's grace on herself, receiving 2 additional Dexterity points for a 13 Dexterity. She then casts mirror move, adopting Ember's Deflect Arrows feat. When mirror move dissipates, Mialee retains her heightened Dexterity until her cat's grace spell ends but she loses access to Deflect Arrows. If she somehow lost the effects of cat's grace before the end of mirror move's duration, she would lose access to the Deflect Arrows feat. One interesting note about mirror move is that the spell conveys all the nuances of the mirrored character's style. Using the previous example, Mialee not only gains the ability to Deflect Arrows but the arcane power results in her deflecting arrows exactly as Ember would do it. Although Ember may not be with Mialee when she cast the mirror move spell, anyone familiar with Ember's style (for instance, a lifelong enemy or former trainer) may recognize that Mialee's arrow deflection is actually borrowed from Ember. Anyone familiar with Ember's defensive style should be allowed a Spot check (DC 15) to recognize the similarities. It's worth noting that Item Creation Feats and Special Feats can not be duplicated by mirror move. Likewise, Metamagic Feats are too subtle and/or complex to be mirrored. Material Component: Any reflective surface, including highly polished shields or armor and even surfaces of water, can be used for this spell. Many spellcasters carry small mirrors with them for material components.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mordenkainen's Force Missles				CLASSES:Wizard=4			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force			COMPS:V S		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to 4 creatures, no two of which can be more than 20 ft. apart		DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:Fires (CASTERLEVEL/5,4) missiles inflicting 2d6 damage with a 5 ft. 1d6 burst|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:You create a powerful missile of magical force, which darts from your fingertips and unerringly strikes its target, dealing 2d6 points of damage. The missile then bursts in a 5-foot blast of force that inflicts half this amount of damage to any creatures in the area (other than the primary target). The primary target is not entitled to a saving throw against the burst, but creatures affected by the burst may attempt a Reflex save for half damage. If the missiles' burst areas overlap, secondary targets make only one saving throw attempt (and only one SR check, if applicable). A character can be struck by one missile (or more) and also be caught in the burst of another missile. In such a case, the character may attempt a Reflex save to halve the burst damage, and SR might apply. The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee or has anything less than total cover or concealment. A caster cannot single out specific parts of a creature. The spell can target and damage unattended objects. For every five caster levels, the caster gains one missile. A caster has two missiles at 9th level or lower, three missiles from 10th to 14th level, and four missiles at 15th level or higher. A caster can make more than one missile strike a single target, if desired. However, the caster must designate targets before rolling for SR or damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nature's Rampart						CLASSES:Druid=3|Cleric=4	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V S M DF	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Structure uo to 40 ft. square								DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:You shape a natural setting into a formidable defensive position|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:You shape a natural setting into a formidable defensive position. Usually this is used to prepare an open outdoor area such as a hillside or a forest, but a large natural cavern could be shaped into a divine rampart. Artificial structures or features are not affected, although a divine rampart could be positioned to fill a gap between two buildings or barricade an unpaved road. The effects of the spell depend on the terrain: Open Outdoor Site: A rampart or dike of earth 5 feet high and 5 feet thick at its base rises immediately behind a shallow ditch 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep along the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the dike receive 75%% cover. Attackers approaching on foot must scramble down into the ditch and then 10 feet up the dike (Climb DC 10). Rough Outdoor Site or Cavern: Loose stones and boulders, deadwood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall 5 feet high and 2 feet thick at the base around the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the wall receive 75%% cover. Marshy or Low-Lying Site: In areas such as marsh, bog, swamp, or tundra, divine rampart cannot raise a wall, but instead creates a water-filled ditch 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep. Creatures forced to wade the ditch are reduced to one-eighth their normal movement (minimum 5 feet) and cannot charge or run. Material Components: A small quartz gem engraved with the image of an exquisite tiny castle, worth at least 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Planar Familiar						CLASSES:Cleric=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S DF XP	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Living creature touched									DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates [harmless]	SPELLRES:Yes [harmless]			SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.14	DESC:Familiar/mount/companion becomes celestial, findish, axiomatic, or anarchic|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:In order to cast this spell, you must have a familiar, special mount, animal companion, or other companion acquired as a class ability. The spell does not function on outsiders or undead. When you cast the spell, the target creature undergoes a transformation into a celestial, fiendish, axiomatic, or anarchic creature, depending on the alignment of your patron deity (or your alignment, if you have no patron deity). If your patron deity is good, the creature becomes celestial. If your patron deity is evil, the creature becomes fiendish. If your patron deity is lawful neutral, the creature becomes axiomatic, and if your patron deity is chaotic neutral, the creature becomes anarchic. The axiomatic and anarchic creature templates are detailed in Manual of the Planes. If the target creature is your familiar, it gains energy resistance, fast healing, damage reduction, and additional damage for its smite attack as though its Hit Dice were equal to your character level. Otherwise, use its actual Hit Dice to determine these qualities. If the target creature becomes axiomatic, its linked minds ability applies to you (and only to you). You cannot cast this spell on another character's companion creature. Most creatures consider the transformation harmless and beneficial, but if the creature resists, a successful Fortitude save negates the spell. XP Cost: 500 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Depletion						CLASSES:Wizard=2|Bard=3		SCHOOL:Necromancy											COMPS:V S		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Ray												DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	DESC:Target temporarily looses ((CASTERLEVEL/2)+1) power points|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:A shimmering ray springs from your hand to disrupt the mental fabric of psionically empowered beings, causing them a loss of power points. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The ray of depletion affects only targets possessing psionic power points. Non-psionic beings hit by a ray register some momentary unpleasant sensory awareness, but not so much as to disrupt an action or concentration. Affected targets suffer a temporary loss of a number of psionic power points equal to 1+ half the attacker's caster level (round down). Thus a 10th-level caster would deplete 6 points. The victim's available psionic power point total can never drop below 0. Lost psionic power points are regained through normal means.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Sonic Blast							CLASSES:Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Sonic			COMPS:V S F		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:5 to (((CASTERLEVEL/2)*5)+25) ft. wide						DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Reflex half				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:inflicts (CASTERLEVEL,10)d6 sonic damage plus bullrush by large creature|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:You fire a brilliant blue ray at a single creature or object within range. If your ranged touch attack succeeds, you charge the target with an intensely powerful magical magnetism effect. You can affect only objects made of metal, or creatures wearing or carrying metal armor, weapons, or gear. You can also choose to target a specific attended metal object in a creature's possession, such as a sword held in the hand. A metal-armored or metallic creature is instantly grappled (see below). The magical magnetism generated by Sirellyn's superior magnetism creates a zone of attraction with a radius of 30 feet around the affected creature or object. Every metallic object entering the zone of attraction is pulled toward the target creature or object by this attractive force, which has an effective Strength score of 10 + the caster's level (maximum 25). Every round in which metal creatures or creatures wearing metal armor remain within the zone of attraction, they must attempt an opposed Strength check against the force. If the attracted creature wins this contest, it suffers no ill effects this round. If it fails, it is entangled and drawn 10 feet closer to the creature or object at the center of the zone, +1 foot for every point by which it failed the opposed Strength check. Creatures carrying or holding metal objects may choose to release them, in which case the items fly to the creature or object at the center. If they instead hold onto them, they are treated as metal creatures. Unattended metal objects of 50 lb. or less in the zone of attraction (including items voluntarily released, as well as metallic missiles fired through the zone) fly with great force and strike the target, inflicting 1d6 points of damage per 5 lb. of weight (maximum 10d6). Objects heavier than 50 lb. are dragged 10 feet closer each round. Metal creatures or objects that reach the target of Sirellyn's superior magnetism become stuck fast to the target. (If the target is a metal or metal-armored creature, it is instantly stuck fast to itself by the spell.) Creatures stuck together this way are considered to be grappled and must first escape the grapple by defeating the attractive force in an opposed Strength check before they can try to move away or take any actions prohibited in a grapple. Similarly, an object stuck to the target must be wrested away with a Strength check before it can be used. If a creature or object within the zone of attraction is more than twice as heavy as the target of Sirellyn's superior magnetism, the subject is dragged to it instead of vice-versa. This naturally moves the zone of attraction, which may shift other creatures out of the magnetism's range of influence. Material Components: A small lodestone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sirellyn's Superior Magnetism				CLASSES:Wizard=6			SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V S M		CASTTIME:1 action		RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One metallic creature or object							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [D]			SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:Creates a magnetic field around one metallic creature or object|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:You generate a deadly beam of sonic energy from your outstretched hand that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The sonic blast may shove creatures in the area back along the path of the spell. Any creature failing its saving throw must make a Strength check (DC equal to damage inflicted by the spell); those who fail find themselves bull rushed directly away from the caster as if by a Large creature with a Strength score equal to the damage the spell inflicted. The spell moves with the target; see the bull rush description in Chapter Eight of the Player's Handbook for details on attacks of opportunity, stability modifiers, etc. If a creature is shoved back into a solid barrier such as a wall or a strong door, the creature sustains an additional 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage. Like a lightning bolt, the sonic blast damages or destroys objects in its path. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier such as a closed door shatters or breaks through it, the sonic blast may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier.

Summon Blood Elemental					CLASSES:Cleric=5			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning						COMPS:V S M DF	CASTTIME:1 full round	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One summoned Medium-sized blood elemental						DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds				SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:Summons a blood elemental to attack your enemies|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:This spell summons a blood elemental to attack your enemies. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. As soon as it arrives, you must designate its target or targets by pointing. If there are multiple creatures in the general area where you point, it attacks them all. Because of the blood elemental's incomprehensible nature (see the Incomprehensible special quality, below), it is not possible to communicate with it by any means that involves language (including a tongues spell or a monk's tongue of the sun and moon ability). Thus, you cannot redirect its attacks verbally, command it to take other actions, or otherwise control it in any way. A blood elemental cannot be dismissed the way other summoned creatures can. If there are no enemies present, or if the blood elemental destroys all the creatures designated as enemies before the duration of the spell ends, it either returns to its home plane voluntarily (25%% chance) or attacks the nearest creature (75%% chance), even if that creature is you. If it decides to continue attacking and there are multiple potential targets at the same distance, it chooses the one that seems weakest. When the spell duration expires, the creature disappears at the end of your turn if it has not already departed. Material Component: A drop of blood from a good creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Understand Object						CLASSES:Bard=1|Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Divination											COMPS:S M		CASTTIME:1 minute		RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One touched object										DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No					SOURCELONG:Spellbook Archive	SOURCESHORT:SA		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	DESC:Determines the non-magical functions of an object or technological item|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Understand object determines the non-magical functions of an object or technological item. The caster must handle or touch the object throughout the casting time and spell duration to gain any knowledge. If the item has more than one function, the spell identifies its most general or most likely use. Casters can gather further information about the item only through additional uses of the spell. Understand object does not reveal magical functions (as identify would), only mechanical operations. The spell is used most often to help casters understand the nature and use of an object from another technological level (such as a firearm found in a world where such weapons don't normally exist), or to gain some clues to extremely complex gadgets or puzzles. If used in the latter manner, however, this spell can prove very, very dangerous. Using understand object to figure out how a trapped device operates can be disastrous, as the spell does not distinguish a harmful nonmagical trap from any other gadget! And, since the spell starts with the easiest or most general effect first (and traps are often much easier to trigger than non-trap functions of an item), understand object may just tell you how to kill yourself. For example, a character might cast the spell on three interlocking rings found on what appears to be the locking mechanism of a box. The first use of the spell tells the caster that the interlocking rings are, indeed, a locking mechanism and they have to be turned in a certain way to cause a needle to spring out of the box (a trap, though the spell doesn't tell the caster that). On a second use of the spell, the caster learns that turning the interlocking rings also can cause the box to open. Since the interlocking rings have no other function, further uses of the spell reveal nothing. If opening the box causes a fire trap to go off in the opener's face, that is not revealed, since fire trap is a magical effect. But when the spell is used in its most basic way, it can be a boon to adventurers who encounter technological items and strange objects that they have no way of understanding without help. New exotic weapons, high-tech gadgets, and the like are the province of understand object.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
