Race Traits ~ Blood Elemental								CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																																																									ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=Blood Elemental Race Trait


Bloodbath				KEY:Blood Elemental ~ Bloodbath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Blood Elemental Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:With a successful grapple check (grapple bonus +12, including a +5 racial bonus on grapple checks), a blood elemental may engulf a creature of up to its own size category. An engulfed creature is subject to drowning (see the Drowning Rule in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The elemental may eject the engulfed creature at any time. A victim that is still alive when it emerges from the blood elemental's body (whether by escaping the monster's hold or by being ejected) takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage because of the strain on its sanity that the sensation of drowning in blood produced. Furthermore, the victim creature must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 15) on emerging or be nauseated for 2d6 rounds.												SOURCEPAGE:p.17

Incomprehensible			KEY:Blood Elemental ~ Incomprehensible	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Blood Elemental Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:Because of its alien mentality, a blood elemental does not understand verbal communication of any sort, nor can its own gurgling language be understood by any creature except its own kind. A blood elemental is immune to all language-dependent spells and effects, and no mundane or magical effect that usually allows verbal communication (including a tongues spell or a monk's tongue of the sun and moon ability) functions with respect to it.
