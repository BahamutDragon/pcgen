Fortified Hustle		KEY:Swiftblade ~ Fortified Hustle	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swiftblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:While under the effect of a haste spell that you cast yourself, the effect becomes extraordinary rather than a continuous spell effect, and therefore cannot be dispelled by any means.

Diligent Rapidity		KEY:Swiftblade ~ Diligent Rapidity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swiftblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:While under the effect of a haste spell that you cast yourself, you can move and attack normally, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, as the freedom of movement spell. See the spell description on page 233 of the Player's Handbook. As an additional effect, you can also move across the surface of placid or flowing water, but not whitewater rapids or stormy water, by making two move actions in a round. You immediately sink any time you make a single move action in a round or come to a complete stop while traversing water.
Perpetual Options		KEY:Swiftblade ~ Perpetual Options	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swiftblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Instead of making one extra attack at your highest base attack bonus while under the effect of a haste spell that you cast yourself, you now have the choice of making one extra move action or one extra standard action.
Innervated Speed		KEY:Swiftblade ~ Innervated Speed	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swiftblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC: Any time you prepare or spontaneously cast haste in a 6th level spell slot, you can subsume the spell at the moment of casting instead, increasing your speed so greatly that other creatures seem frozen in time, as the time stop spell, but for one round. See the spell description on page 294 of the Player's Handbook. For each spell slot level higher than 6th level, you can extend innervated speed by 1 additional round. You cannot subsume a new haste spell until the original innervated speed duration expires and your turn ends. Moreover, you cannot subsume a metamagic version of haste.
