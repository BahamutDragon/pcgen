Powers Known			KEY:Crystal Master ~ Powers Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crystal Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:At every level indicated on the table, a crystal master gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if she had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of crystal master to the level of whatever psionic manifesting class the character has, then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester level accordingly. Unlike most other prestige classes, the crystal master does gain effective additional levels for her psicrystal's powers. If a character had more than one psionic class before she became a crystal master, she must decide to which class she adds the new level of crystal master for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.

Embed Gem (Su)			KEY:Crystal Master ~ Embed Gem				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crystal Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DEFINE:EmbedGemCount|0	DEFINE:EmbeddedGemBonus|0	DEFINE:EmbeddedGemsCount|0	DESC:When the crystal master gains this ability, she adds another embedded gem to her body. She can embed up to five gems (see table below) -- one each in the arms, legs, and chest. Once a part of the body has a gem embedded in it, another gem cannot be embedded in that part of the body. The powers and restrictions on each gem are found below. The level restriction is the minimum level of crystal master needed to take this gem. Each type of gem can be embedded only once. The gem itself must initially be unworked and nonenhanced in any way (in other words, it cannot have any magical or psionic properties). It needs to have a minimum value of 100 gp before it is cut. The crystal master needs to make a DC 15 Craft (gemcutting) check to successfully shape the stone for embedding. If for some reason the crystal master's body is destroyed and she somehow gains access to a new body, she may re-embed any lost gems within the new body. The gems must be the same type as the originals and embedded in the same order.
