The dragons of Argonnessen seek meaning in the patterns they observe all around them, looking for omens of the draconic Prophecy.

Elemental Smite		SOURCEPAGE:p.47	TYPE:General				CATEGORY:FEAT	PREMULT:2,[PRESTAT:1,CHA=11],[PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=3]	DESC:You can channel the energy associated with one of your elemental grafts into your melee attacks.

If you accidentally smite a creature that has immunity to the type of energy damage you deal, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. Likewise, a missed smite attack means the smite attempt is used for the day. You can use this smite attack once per day, plus one additional time per fi ve levels gained (two times per day at 5th, three times per day at 10th, and so on).

All special abilities are described below; those requiring additional information follow the chart. Unless otherwise specifi ed, an ability can only be taken once. Each time the homunculus gains a HD, you can choose to remove any one special ability already granted from this feat and select another ability to replace the lost one. For example, an artifi cer with a 4-HD homunculus that has the climber special ability could choose to give it sneak attack instead if the homunculus's Hit Dice were increased to 5. This feat applies to the character's homunculus regardless of its type. For new types of homunculi, see Chapter 6.
