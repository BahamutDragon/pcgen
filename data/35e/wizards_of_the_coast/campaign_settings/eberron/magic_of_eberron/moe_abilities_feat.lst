The dragons of Argonnessen seek meaning in the patterns they observe all around them, looking for omens of the draconic Prophecy. Like the dragons, you seek to untangle and perceive the record of everything that has been, and more important, what will be. The world is the record, and you are the perennial student.

If you use lightning reins or a wheel of wind and water (depending on the nature of the vessel you are attempting to pilot), your bonus increases to +10. If you fail the opposed Charisma check, the vessel continues its current motion, though you can try again the following round. Even characters not of House Orien or House Lyrandar sometimes take this feat, in an effort to pilot airships and earth sleds without the auspices of the dragonmarked houses.
Elemental Smite		SOURCEPAGE:p.47	TYPE:General				CATEGORY:FEAT	PREMULT:2,[PRESTAT:1,CHA=11],[PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=3]	DESC:You can channel the energy associated with one of your elemental grafts into your melee attacks.

If you have more than one elemental graft, you choose one of the graft's associated energy types when you make the elemental smite attack. If you accidentally smite a creature that has immunity to the type of energy damage you deal, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. Likewise, a missed smite attack means the smite attempt is used for the day. You can use this smite attack once per day, plus one additional time per fi ve levels gained (two times per day at 5th, three times per day at 10th, and so on).

PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Craft Construct or craft homunculus class feature, Craft (any) 6 ranks.	BENEFIT:Your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its HD (see chart). If you use the Craft Construct feat to construct a homunculus, it gets these abilities when you create it. If you use the craft homunculus class feature of the artifi cer class, your homunculus gains natural armor and special abilities based on its current HD, and additional natural armor or special abilities if you later increase its HD. All special abilities are described below; those requiring additional information follow the chart. Unless otherwise specifi ed, an ability can only be taken once. Each time the homunculus gains a HD, you can choose to remove any one special ability already granted from this feat and select another ability to replace the lost one. For example, an artifi cer with a 4-HD homunculus that has the climber special ability could choose to give it sneak attack instead if the homunculus's Hit Dice were increased to 5. This feat applies to the character's homunculus regardless of its type. For new types of homunculi, see Chapter 6.
