FAINT MEMORY
Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Psion/wilder 3
Display: Auditory
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will negates, see text
Power Resistance: No
Power Points: 5
Throughout Sarlona, the kalashtar are a pursued and persecuted
people. While many have found refuge in Adar,
they must sometimes travel beyond the relative safety of
the mountains. To keep their passage as secret as possible,
kalashtar psions employ this power to help conceal their
furtive endeavors.
This power draws on the dreamstuff of Dal Quor, concealing
your presence, your thoughts, and your intentions.
You gain a +5 competence bonus on Move Silently and Hide
checks, and a +5 competence bonus on Bluff and Disguise
checks made when interacting with others. In addition, any
creature you interact with must succeed on a Will saving
throw to fully remember the encounter. If you attack the
creature, it gains a +4 bonus on its save.
On a failed save, the creature’s memory of the encounter
becomes quite vague, much like the remnants of a dream.
In such cases, the creature remembers only details that you
specify (though those details must be real). For example, you
might leave a lucid memory of a phrase or other message, or
allow your signature cape to be remembered.
Augment: You can augment this power in one or both
of the following ways.
1. For every additional power point you spend, you can
include one additional creature in the effect of the power.
2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this
power’s save DC increases by 1.
FORCED DREAM
Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Psion/wilder 3
Display: Auditory and mental
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft. / 2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Power Resistance: Yes (harmless)
Power Points: 5
The Inspired, through their connection to Dal Quor, have
discovered a way to induce a forced dream state in which
a creature gains a limited ability to reshape its own reality.
While this power is active, any time during its turn
the target can choose (as a swift action) to “restart” its
turn. Everything that has transpired since the start of its
turn is erased, effectively allowing the target to step back
a moment in time to relive the turn. Doing this ends the
power’s duration.
When this effect is used, everyone and everything
is reset to the state they were at when the subject’s turn
began. Any spells or abilities used are available again, any
damage dealt is healed, any effects incurred are negated,
any objects or creatures moved are reset to their original
position, and so on. The only exception to this is that any
power points spent to manifest forced dream are not recovered
(meaning that if you manifest the power and activate
its effect in the same turn, you return to the start of the
turn but you do not get back the power points you spent to
manifest the power.)
Augment: If you spend 4 additional power points, the
duration of the forced dream increases to 1 minute per level.

Augment: You can augment this power in one or both
of the following ways.

Area: 30-ft.-radius spread centered on you
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)

Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: 3
This power is favored by the Inspired leaders of Riedra,
who use it to enhance their infl uence over the humans
of that land. When you manifest this power, you radiate
psychic energy that refl ects your innate power, granting
a +4 morale bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks
made to infl uence others. When you stop concentrating
on this power, any enemy within the area becomes shaken
for 1 minute unless it succeeds on a Will save.
Augment: You can augment this power in one or both
of the following ways.
1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this
power’s save DC increases by 1.

PROJECT QUORI SPIRIT
Metacreativity
Level: Psion/wilder 3
Display: Visual; see text
Manifesting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: One projected quori spirit
Duration: Concentration
Saving Throw: None
Power Resistance: No
Power Points: 5
This power creates a quasi-real mental projection of a
tsoreva quori spirit of Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams.
Although the quori spirits are trapped within Dal Quor,
a psion using this power can create a shell resembling the
physical form of a quori. This shell is then temporarily
inhabited by a quori spirit.
A projected quori spirit behaves much like a summoned
monster. It appears where you designate and acts immediately,
on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of
its ability. If you speak Quori, you can direct it not to attack,
to attack a particular enemy, or to perform other actions.
A projected quori spirit is subject to dismissal or any
other effect that removes possession, such as the domain
power granted by the Exorcism domain (see page 106 of the
EBERRON Campaign Setting).
The tsoreva quori spirit is described on page 147.
Augment: For every 4 additional power points you
spend, one additional tsoreva quori spirit can be projected,
to a maximum of four tsoreva quori.
For 8 additional power points, this power can project
a tsucora quori spirit (see page 296 of the EBERRON Campaign
Setting) instead of one or more tsoreva quori.
For 14 additional power points, this power can project
a dream master quori spirit instead of one or more tsoreva
quori. The dream master quori is described on page 148.
PSYCHIC BEACON
Clairsentience
Level: Psion/wilder 2
Display: Auditory, mental, and visual
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature or object
Duration: 24 hours
Saving Throw: Will negates, or none (object)
Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: 3
By manifesting this power, you place a psionic signature on
a creature or an unattended object. You can automatically
detect the presence of the signature whenever it is within
1,000 feet of you, and in such cases you know the direction
and approximate distance to the target object or creature.
If the distance between you and the psychic beacon
increases beyond 1,000 feet, you can determine the direction
and approximate distance to the signature object or
creature by concentrating (a move action).
Augment: You can augment this power in one or both
of the following ways.
1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this
power’s save DC (if applicable) increases by 1.
2. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can
designate a willing creature to detect the beacon. You must
touch the creature as you manifest the power. For the duration
of the power, that creature senses the location of the
beacon instead of you.

SENSE DANGER
Clairsentience
Level: Psion/wilder 3, psychic warrior 2
Display: Auditory, mental, and visual
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: Psion/wilder 5, psychic warrior 3
The kalashtar of Adar must always be alert for agents of
the Dreaming Dark, since an ambush could be around
any corner. Kalashtar psychic warriors developed their
precognition powers to enable them to be less likely to be
caught by surprise.
When you manifest this power, you are able to quickly
react to unexpected situations. For the duration of this
power, you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class
when you are fl at-footed.
In addition, you can manifest one power as an immediate
action during either a surprise round or during the fi rst
round if there is no surprise round. The power manifested
must have a manifesting time of 1 standard action, and can
have a cost no higher than 1 power point. You can continue
to manifest powers as an immediate action at the beginning
of later encounters for as long as sense danger is in effect.
Augment: For every additional power point you spend,
you can spend 1 more power point on the power you manifest
at the outset of combat.
STUN QUORI SPIRIT
Psychokinesis
Level: Psion/wilder 3
Display: Mental
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: See text
Target: One outsider, or one possessed creature
or object
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates
Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: 5
In their fi ght against the Inspired, the
kalashtar have found that targeting
a quori spirit directly can be more
effective than fi ghting its host. With a
psychokinetic blast, this power sends
a possessing spirit reeling. As the
power became more widely used,
adepts discovered its effectiveness
against a wide range of otherworldly
creatures.
An outsider targeted by this power
must make a Will save or be stunned.
At the end of the affected creature’s
turn, it can attempt another Will
saving throw to shake off the effect.
If you target a possessed creature or
object, the possessing spirit must succeed
on a Will save or become dormant.
A dormant spirit can take no actions and
cannot provide an ally benefi t, nor can it
control or otherwise harm the host creature (see Possession, page 100 of the EBERRON Campaign Setting). The
spirit remains dormant for the power’s duration.
Augment: You can augment this power in one or both
of the following ways.
1. For every 4 additional power points you spend, you
can affect one additional target.
2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this
power’s save DC increases by 1.

# 107
SUPPRESS SCHISM
Psychokinesis
Level: Psion/wilder 5
Display: Auditory and visual
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous, 1 round/level; see text
Saving Throw: Will partial
Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: 9
Two minds working together can provide a signifi cant
defense against psionic powers, as demonstrated by the
resiliency of the Inspired and the fl exibility of the schism
power. The kalashtar psion mystics of Adar have mastered
a power that disrupts telepathic communication. They discovered
in practice that it could be used as a weapon against
the quori spirits that hunt them.
Suppress schism interferes with powers and effects from
the telepathy discipline. When you manifest this power, you
make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum
+15) against each ongoing telepathy power in effect
on the target creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11
+ the power’s manifester level. If you succeed on a particular
check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power
remains in effect.
In addition, if the target fails a Will save, any form of
dual mind effect is disrupted for the duration of the power,
including the effects of the schism power, an Inspired’s dual
mind ability, and a kalashtar’s +2 bonus on saving throws
against mind-affecting spells and abilities.
If the target is a possessed creature, the possessing
mind must succeed on the save or become suppressed for
the power’s duration, in which case the target creature can
act normally. Because the Inspired are possessed creatures,
using this power against an Inspired acting as host to a quori
spirit requires the quori spirit to fi rst save against being
suppressed. On a successful save, the Inspired must then
save against the disruption of its dual mind ability.
On a failed save, if the target creature attempts to
manifest a telepathy power while suppress schism is in effect, it
must make a manifester level check (DC 11 + your manifester
level) or fail to manifest the power.
Augment: For every 2 additional power points you
spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1.
WAKING DREAMS
Clairsentience [Mind-Affecting, Fear]
Level: Psion/wilder 2
Display: Auditory, mental, and visual
Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round/level; see text
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: 3
You gain a brief glimpse into the realm of Dal Quor, learning
the base substance of the dreams or nightmares of a
target creature. You then telepathically fi lter that knowledge
into the target creature’s waking mind.
This power can be benefi cial, allowing a target to
uncover the hidden meanings of his dreams. This insight
grants the target a +1 morale bonus on either attack rolls
or saving throws (target’s choice) for the duration of the
effect.
Alternatively, this power can be used to force a creature
to relive its nightmares. A creature targeted in this manner
becomes shaken unless it succeeds on a Will save.
This power has no effect on creatures that do not dream
(such as kalashtar and warforged), but has its normal effect
on elves (whose trance is a suffi ciently dreamlike state).
Augment: You can augment this power in one or both
of the following ways.
1. If you spend 4 additional power points, a target that
fails its saving throw against its nightmares must make an
additional Will save or become dazed. Each round at the end
of its turn, the dazed creature can attempt another saving
throw to shake off the daze effect, but it is still shaken for
the duration of the power.
2. For every 2 additional power points you spend, this
power’s save DC increases by 1.
