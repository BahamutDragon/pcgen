ABLATIVE ARMOR
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 1
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Suit of armor touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
Armor imbued with this infusion absorbs 5 points of
damage from the next attack that deals damage to the
creature that wears it (treat this as one-time damage
reduction 5/—). Forms of damage that aren’t affected by
damage reduction likewise overcome ablative armor. Once
the infused item has prevented damage from a single
attack (even if not all the damage reduction is needed),
the magic fades.
The damage reduction increases by 1 for every caster
level above 1st, to a maximum of 15/— at 10th level.
Special: A character with any Mark of Sentinel dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Deneith), casts
this infusion at +1 caster level.
Material Component: A shard of scrap metal from a forge.
ADAMANTINE WEAPON
Transmutation
Level: Artifi cer 3
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Weapon touched
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
This infusion temporarily alters the substance of one
weapon, transforming it into adamantine. This effect
replaces the properties of any other special material the
weapon might be constructed from. Only weapons made of
metal can benefi t from this infusion.
Material Component: A pinch of powdered adamantine.

ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE
Divination
Level: Bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 hour/level or until discharged
You tap the ancient knowledge of fate and fortune, giving
you a greater ability to focus on a particularly diffi cult
academic problem. Before making a Knowledge check, you
can decide to discharge this spell as an immediate action to
give yourself a +5 insight bonus on the check. If you do not
have any ranks in the Knowledge skill, it is still treated as
an untrained check.
Special: A character with any Mark of Finding dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Tharashk), treats
any Knowledge check made in conjunction with this spell as a
trained check, even if he doesn’t have any ranks in the skill.
Focus: A piece of ivory worth at least 100 gp.
BLAST ROD
Evocation
Level: Artifi cer 3
Components: S, F
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Rod touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: Yes
You store energy within a rod, then unleash it in rays of
destructive power. The blast rod can deal a total of 1d8 points
of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), either focused
into a single blast or divided up among multiple blasts.
To use the rod, you designate how many dice of damage
you wish to release, then make a ranged touch attack as a
standard action against any target within 60 feet. Regardless
of whether the attack hits or not, the damage dice you
specifi ed are subtracted from the total stored in the rod.
Focus: The rod to be infused.
CENSURE ELEMENTALS
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 4
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: None (object) or Will half; see text
Spell Resistance: No (object) or Yes; see text
When artifi cers began construction of some of the fi rst
great elemental vessels, they wanted a way to keep elementals
from wreaking havoc prior to being bound. This infusion
was developed as a means of conditioning the elementals
through negative reinforcement.
Typically cast into a pole or other prod, this infusion
creates a fi eld that can harm elemental creatures. When held
aloft (a standard action), the infused item deals 2d4 points
of damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +15) to
any elemental creatures within a 20-foot-radius area. This
damage repeats each round at the start of the artifi cer’s
turn as long as the item is held aloft (a standard action). A
successful Will save halves this damage, and spell resistance
applies against this effect.
The caster can designate up to one elemental creature
per level to have immunity to the effects of the infusion.
Special: A character with any Mark of Making dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Cannith), casts
this spell at +1 caster level.
Material Component: A pinch of kiln-hardened mud.
CLOTHIER’S CLOSET
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: One or more sets of clothes
Duration: 1 hour/level (D); see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
When you and your companions need to attend a gala
reception at the last minute, you need not despair over
your clothing. When you cast clothier’s closet, you conjure a
3-inch-diameter wooden rod up to 10 feet long between
any two upright supports you choose. For example, you
could summon the rod to appear between two walls of a
corridor or alcove. On the rod hang a number of outfi ts
as determined by you, each of a size and type you specify
while the spell is cast.
The conjured rod can hold a variety of separate outfi ts
whose total price does not exceed 100 gp. The outfi t types
that you can specify include the following: artisan’s outfi t
(1 gp), cleric’s vestments (5 gp), cold weather outfi t (8
gp), courtier’s outfi t (30 gp), entertainer’s outfi t (3 gp),
explorer’s outfi t (10 gp), monk’s outfi t (5 gp), noble’s outfi t
(75 gp), scholar’s outfi t (5 gp), or traveler’s outfi t (1 gp).
The conjured clothing is normal in all respects and
does not radiate magic. Even after the duration elapses and
the rod and hangers disappear, the clothes remain.
Special: A character with any Mark of Hospitality
dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat (Ghallanda),
can cast this spell without the material component,
but the conjured clothes last only as long as the spell’s
duration.
Material Component: A gem worth at least 100 gp.
CONCURRENT INFUSIONS
Transmutation
Level: Artifi cer 4
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
	DESC:You channel your artifi cer talents through an increased
number of minor infusions. When you cast this infusion,
you can imbue the target object with the effects of
three different 1st-level infusions chosen at the time of
casting. The infusions function exactly as if you had cast
them on the object, and do not count against your daily
allotment.
Material Component: An oak twig with at least three forks
along its length.

CONTROL ELEMENTAL
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One elemental with HD no greater than twice your
caster level
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
This spell enables you to command an elemental for a short
period of time. While a spellcaster does not normally have
line of effect to a bound elemental, which remains bound
by a Khyber shard, a caster can establish line of effect by
maintaining physical contact with the dragonshard while
casting this spell. In such a case, the caster of control elemental
would also need to have contact with the Khyber shard
binding the elemental, or in the case of an elemental
vessel, access to the helm, whenever he wished to give the
elemental an order.
The elemental is commanded by voice and understands
you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication
is impossible (in the area of a silence spell, for
instance), the targeted elemental does not attack you. When
the spell’s duration expires, the target elemental reverts to
its normal behavior and remembers that you controlled it.
DETECT DRAGONMARK
Divination
Level: Cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 60 ft.
Area: Cone-shaped emanation
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
You can sense the presence of dragonmarks. The amount
of information you receive about a particular dragonmark
depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
1st Round: Presence or absence of dragonmarks.
2nd Round: Number of dragonmarks (on creatures or
objects) in the area, and the type (aberrant, least, lesser,
greater, or Siberys) of the most potent dragonmark.
3rd Round: The location and type of each dragonmark.
If the objects or creatures bearing the dragonmarks are
in line of sight, you can attempt Spellcraft checks to
determine the name of the spell-like ability granted by
the mark (see page 47 of the EBERRON Campaign Setting for the
appropriate DC). If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you
also learn whether the mark’s spell-like ability has any
remaining uses for the day.
Arcane Material Component: A scale from a true dragon.
DIMENSION LEAP
Conjuration (Teleportation)
Level: Bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 ft./level
Target: You and touched objects
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
You instantly transfer yourself from your current location
to another spot within range. The distance traveled
must be an increment of 10 feet (10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet,
and so on). You always arrive at exactly the spot desired,
whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction
and distance. You can bring along any objects you
are touching as the spell is cast, so long as their weight
doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You cannot bring
along other creatures.
If this spell would put you in a place that is already
occupied by a solid body, the spell fails.
Special: A character with any Mark of Passage dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Orien), uses his
character level rather than his caster level to determine the
distance teleported.
DISTRACTING SHADOWS
Evocation [Darkness]
Level: Bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1
Components: V, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 24 hours (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
This spell causes an object to radiate distracting shadows
in a 10-foot-radius spread. Casual scrutiny of an affected
area doesn’t reveal anything out of the ordinary; however,
cracks, crannies, corners, hidden traps, and secret
entrances or exits within the area become harder to spot.
Creatures within the area or looking into it are
subliminally confused by the distracting shadows, and take
a –5 penalty on all Spot and Search checks. However,
the shadows do not provide suffi cient concealment for a
creature to make a Hide check.
Distracting shadows counters or dispels any light or darkness
spell of equal or lower level.
Distracting shadows can be made permanent with a permanency
spell (minimum caster level 10th; cost 1,000 XP).
Special: A character with any Mark of Shadow dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Phiarlan or Thuranni),
can cast this spell to fi ll a 20-foot-radius spread.
Material Component: A bit of bat fur and either a drop of
pitch or a piece of coal.

# 96

ELEMENTAL PROD
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 2
Components: S
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Staff or pole touched
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
The need to control elementals more easily during the
binding process led to the creation of an infusion that
imbues a staff or pole with the ability to move elementals.
As a standard action, the wielder of an elemental prod can
gesture with the staff, indicating the starting and ending
position for a target elemental creature. The total distance
covered must be no greater than 10 feet + 5 feet/2 caster levels.
The target creature immediately understands the command
to move, and it can elect to be pushed along without resisting.
Elementals that choose to resist take 1d6 points of damage
and are moved only 5 feet in the desired direction.
EXPOSE THE DEAD
Divination
Level: Cleric 2, paladin 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute/level (D)
You gain a sixth sense that allows you to better locate undead
creatures, as well as to investigate corpses. Your eyes turn white
while under the effect of the spell, making it seem as though
you were blind (although you can see as well as normal).
While this spell is in effect, you gain an insight bonus
equal to your caster level (maximum +10) on Survival checks
made to track undead, and you can follow undead tracks
with a DC above 10 as if you had the Track feat. You gain the
same insight bonus on Listen and Spot checks made against
undead creatures.
In addition, you gain an insight bonus equal to your
caster level (maximum +10) on Search checks made when
examining a dead body, and you are treated as if you had the
Investigate feat (see page 55 of the EBERRON Campaign Setting)
when doing so.
Finally, while this spell is active, increase the save DC
of any speak with dead spell you cast by 2.
Arcane Material Component: A dwarf’s fi ngerbone.
GLIMPSE OF ETERNITY
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round/3 levels
Saving Throw: Will partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
You call upon the ancestral memory and experience of the
long-lived elves, visiting all the burden of that knowledge
on a single creature. The target of the spell takes 1d6 points
of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and
is confused for the duration of the spell unless it makes a Will
save. A successful save results in half damage and negates
the confusion.
Elves and similarly long-lived creatures are affected
normally by this spell. No creature can experience millennia
of knowledge in such a short time without feeling its weight.
Material Component: A pinch of dust from an hourglass.
GLIMPSE OF THE PROPHECY
Divination
Level: Bard 6, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 hour/level or until discharged
You gain powerful insight into the workings of the draconic
Prophecy, granting you inner strength and a potent
sixth sense in relation to your surroundings. You gain a
+1 insight bonus to Armor Class and a +1 insight bonus on
saving throws for the duration of the spell.
Once during the spell’s duration, you can gain an
insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum
+10) on any saving throw. Activating this effect is an immediate
action, but it must be done before you make the roll to
be modifi ed. Once this ability is used, the spell ends.
If you have the Dragon Prophesier feat (see page 46),
you can enter a state of prophetic favor as an immediate
action instead of a full-round action while this spell is in
effect. This still counts as one of your daily uses of prophetic
favor. Once this ability is used, the spell ends.
You cannot have more than one glimpse of the Prophecy spell
active on you at the same time.
HIDDEN WARD
Illusion (Glamer)
Level: Bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 24 hours; see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
This spell helps disguise the presence of any spells
(including glyph of warding) that have been cast upon the
target object. If detect magic or a similar effect is used to
detect the presence of magical auras on the object, the
caster must succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + your
caster level) to fi nd any magical auras that are the result of
active spells. (The DM should make this roll in secret to
prevent suspicion by the players.) A single successful check
will reveal both the hidden ward and the spells it hides.
In addition, casting this spell on a magic trap (such as a
fire trap spell cast on an object) increases the Search DC to fi nd
the trap by one-half your caster level (maximum +5). This spell cannot be used to conceal nonmagical traps, nor does it
hide the magical properties of an item that aren’t dependent
on active spells (such as the magic aura of a +1 longsword).
Special: When cast by a character with any Mark of
Warding dragonmark, or with the Favored in House feat
(Kundarak), the duration increases to one day per level.
Material Component: Lead shavings and powdered diamond
worth 100 gp.

# 97

INDISPUTABLE POSSESSION
Conjuration (Teleportation)
Level: Artifi cer 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Object touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
This infusion creates a bond between you and an object. If
that item ever leaves your possession, you can call it back to
your hand as a move action. The bond is severed if the item
is out of your possession for more than 1 minute per artifi -
cer level. A creature holding onto an item you are trying to
retrieve can make a Will save to retain its grasp on the item,
but that creature must be holding or wearing it, not merely
carrying the object among its possessions.
KHYBER TRAP
Abjuration
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3
Components: S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One outsider or extraplanar creature
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
This spell draws upon the binding power of a
Khyber dragonshard to trap an extraplanar
creature for a short duration. If the creature
fails its Will save, it is drawn into the
Khyber shard. It can take no actions inside
the shard, though it can communicate if it
is capable of telepathy. If the dragonshard
containing the creature is broken, the
creature is released.
Focus: A Khyber dragonshard worth at
least 100 gp per HD of the target creature.
The focus can hold only one trapped creature
at a time.
LEAP INTO ANIMAL
Transmutation
Level: Druid 2, ranger 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 ft.
Target: You and one willing animal;
see text
Duration: 1 minute/level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes
Leap into animal enables you to meld your body and up to
100 pounds of nonliving gear into a single willing animal
(such as an animal companion). The animal must be your
size category or larger. To any observer, you appear to leap
and phase into the animal; you are gone, while the animal
remains. For all intents and purposes, you no longer exist
while merged with the animal, and you cannot be detected
or affected by anything as long as you remain within it.
While melded with the animal, you mentally direct
its actions. You can make it attack, run, or take any other
action it could normally physically accomplish. However,
because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence,
it can undertake actions normally beyond its own
instincts (such as manipulating objects with its claws or
mouth). Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including
an order to attack a creature two or more size categories
larger) are ignored. You receive direct sensory input from
the creature using its normal senses and skill modifi ers.
You cannot take any mental actions while within the
animal other than directing it or dismissing the effect (such
that you cannot manifest a psionic power or cast a spell, even
if it has no components).
Injury to the animal has no effect on you. If the animal
is killed, if the spell is dispelled or dismissed, or if the
spell’s duration expires, you appear (as if leaping forth
from the animal) in an open space of your choice within 10 feet of the animal’s position. If no open space exists, you
are shunted to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points
of damage per 10 feet so moved.
Special: A character with any Mark of Handling dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Vadalis), can use
this spell to merge with an unwilling animal.

# 98

LEECH UNDEATH
Necromancy
Level: Cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 8
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One undead creature
Saving Throw: Will half
Duration: Instantaneous; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
This spell drains away a portion of the negative energy that
keeps an undead creature animated, transferring it to you
in the form of temporary healing. The spell deals 5 points
of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points). At the
same time, you gain temporary hit points equal to the
damage dealt, up to a maximum equal to the current hit
points of the target. For example, a 13th-level cleric would
normally deal 65 points of damage to an undead creature.
However, if that creature had only 48 hit points remaining,
the caster would gain only 48 hit points (even as the target
was destroyed). These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
A successful Will save halves the damage dealt and the hit
points gained.
This spell is often cast on willing undead to aid their
living masters. Nonintelligent undead cannot be commanded
to voluntarily fail their saves or lower any spell
resistance, but intelligent undead can be.
Arcane Material Component: A handful of dead cockroaches.
LUCKY BLADE
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 2
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Weapon touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level or until discharged
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
A weapon imbued with this infusion allows the
bearer to draw upon the luck stored within it, gaining
an immediate reroll of an attack roll (or of the roll
to confi rm a critical threat) made with that weapon.
The decision to use this ability must be made before
the DM declares whether the roll results in success or
failure. The wearer must take the result of the second roll,
even if it is worse. The magic of this infusion functions
only one time.
Material Component: A two-headed coin.
LUCKY CAPE
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 3
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Cloak or cape touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level or until discharged
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
A cape imbued with this infusion allows the bearer to draw
upon the luck stored within it, gaining an immediate reroll
of a saving throw. The decision to use this ability must be
made before the DM declares whether the saving throw
results in success or failure. The wearer must take the result
of the second roll, even if it is worse. The magic of this infusion
functions only one time.
Material Component: A two-headed coin.
MAGIC WEAPON,

Target: Melee or ranged weapons held by allied creatures
in a 20-ft.-radius burst
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)

the Player’s Handbook), except as noted above and as follows. It
only affects weapons held by allies when the spell is cast. It
has no effect on ammunition.

# 99

METAMAGIC SCROLL
Transmutation
Level: Artifi cer 1
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Touch
Target: Spell completion magic item touched
Duration: 1 round/level or until used
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)
You apply a metamagic feat you know to a single spell written
or stored on a spell completion item, such as a scroll or
minor schema (see page 122). For the duration of this infusion,
anyone who uses the imbued item applies the effect of
that metamagic feat to the spell.
You can only apply the benefi t of a metamagic feat that
adjusts the spell’s level by two levels or less (Silent Spell or
Empower Spell, for example, but not Maximize Spell). No
more than one metamagic feat can be applied to any single
spell by way of metamagic scroll.
MINDBURN
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round/3 levels
Saving Throw: Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
This spell attacks a creature’s mind, causing
the target to lose its highest-level remaining
spell, spell slot, or infusion slot each round.
The target gets a save to avoid this effect
each round. On its fi rst successful save, the
spell ends.
Material Component: An empty crystal vial.
ORB OF DANCING DEATH
Necromancy
Level: Cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: Orb of negative energy
Duration: 1 round/3 levels
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
You call upon dark necromantic energy to drain the life
force of your foes. You create a small orb of pulsing black
energy (about 6 inches across) that fl ies toward a chosen
creature, striking as a ranged touch attack. If it hits, the
creature gains 1 negative level.
Each round as a move action, you can direct the orb of
dancing death to attack another creature within range (including
the previous target, if desired). If not directed, the orb
returns to your side.
If a creature has at least as many negative levels as HD,
it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a –1 penalty on
attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and
effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC,
and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally,
a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her
highest available level. Negative levels stack.
Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels
after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum
15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of
permanently draining the victim’s levels, but the negative
levels from the orb of dancing death don’t last long enough to
do so.
An undead creature struck by the orb gains 5 temporary
hit points for 1 hour.
Material Component: A piece of a zombie’s skull.

# 100

OVERWHELMING REVELATIONS
Evocation
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Area: 20-ft.-radius burst
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
You tap the incredible complexity of the draconic Prophecy,
granting creatures in the area a burst of insight powerful
enough to threaten their sanity. Creatures in the area take
a –2d6 penalty to Wisdom and are confused for 1 round. A
successful Will save reduces the penalty by half and negates
the confusion.
Special: Characters with the Dragon Prophesier feat (see
page 46) have immunity to the effect of this spell. Furthermore,
if within the area of the spell, such a character can
choose to enter prophetic favor as an immediate action. This
counts as one of the character’s daily uses of prophetic favor.
Characters with a dragonmark take a –2 penalty on
their saving throw against this spell.
Material Component: A scale from an adult or older
dragon.
PENDING POTION
Transmutation
Level: Artifi cer 1
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Vial of potion or oil touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
You magically delay the effects of a potion or oil. Once
imbued with this infusion, a potion can be consumed or an
oil applied, but the effects of the potion or oil do not take
place immediately. Instead, the creature that consumed the
potion or had the oil applied to it can activate its effects as
a swift action at any time before the end of the infusion’s
duration. If the consumed potion or oil is not activated
before the duration expires, it takes effect at that point.
An oil that is applied to an object is normally activated
by the wielder of the object, rather than the character who
applied the oil. However, if an oil imbued with this infusion
is applied to an intelligent construct (such as a warforged
or homunculus), only the construct can activate the effects
of the oil. If an oil imbued with this infusion is applied to a
nonintelligent construct (such as a golem), only the character
who applied the oil can activate it.
No creature or object can have more than one delayedeffect
potion or oil in effect at the same time. If a second
delayed-effect potion or oil is consumed by the same creature
or applied to the same object, the duration of the fi rst
pending potion infusion ends, and the potion or oil takes effect
immediately.
Material Component: A handful of needles from an evergreen
tree.
REINFORCE CONSTRUCT
Transmutation

Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Construct touched
Duration: 1 hour/level or until discharged; see text
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: No
You bolster a construct’s frame, making it better able to
withstand blows. The construct gains temporary hit points
equal to 1d6 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10). A warforged
artifi cer who imbues himself with this infusion
instead gains temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per
caster level (maximum +10).
Special: A character with any Mark of Making dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Cannith), casts
this infusion at +1 caster level.
SCALDING TOUCH
Evocation [Fire]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Targets: Up to one creature/level touched
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
	DESC:Your hand ignites with the white-hot fury of the sun, dealing
13d6 points of fi re damage with a successful melee touch
attack. Touched creatures are also dazed for 1 round by the
burning pain unless they make a successful Fortitude saving
throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to once per
caster level.

SCRY TRAP
Abjuration
Level: Cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 1 hour/level
Saving Throw: See text
Spell Resistance: See text
You ward a creature against scrying, granting it defenses
capable of terribly wounding any would-be scryer. If the
subject of this spell comes within 10 feet of a sensor created
by a divination (scrying) spell, the scry trap automatically
activates. The caster of the scrying spell takes 1d6 points
of damage per your caster level (maximum 15d6) and is
blinded for 1 minute. A successful Will save halves the
damage and negates the blindness; spell resistance also
applies against this effect.
In addition, the caster of the scrying spell must succeed
on a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level) or the
scrying spell is dispelled immediately (spell resistance does
not apply against this effect). The subject of scry trap becomes
automatically aware when the spell triggers, although the
subject gains no knowledge as to the nature of the scrying
spell or its caster.
Special: A character with any Mark of Detection dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Medani), casts this
spell at +1 caster level.
Material Component: Powdered glass from a broken mirror.
SEMBLANCE OF LIFE
Necromancy
Level: Cleric 6
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Targets: One or more undead creatures, no two of
which can be more than 30 ft. apart
Duration: 1 round/3 levels and 1 round; see text
Saving Throw: Will partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
When this spell is cast, a solemn gray energy quickly settles
on all undead creatures you target. This energy rapidly
breaks apart the necromantic power that holds the undead
together, dealing 3d6 points of damage to each target each
round (no save).
In addition, intelligent undead creatures affected
by the spell become briefl y aware of the mockery of life
they represent, and they might become temporarily overwhelmed
by grief and pain over their condition. Such
creatures are dazed for 1 round, but are allowed a Will save
to negate this effect.
SENSE WEAKNESS
Divination
Level: Cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 24 hours
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
You grant the subject of the spell insight into the vulnerability
of a single opponent. Once over the next 24 hours,
the subject can automatically confi rm a single critical
threat. The subject must declare the use of the spell after
the threat is rolled but before rolling to confi rm the critical
hit (so the spell cannot be used to reroll a failed critical
confi rmation roll).
SHARED HEALING
Conjuration (Healing)
Level: Cleric 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Creature touched
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will half (harmless); see text
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)
	DESC:You grant the target creature the ability to cure its own
wounds. The subject can cure up to twice your caster level in
hit points (maximum 20 hit points) while the spell’s duration
lasts, and can spread this healing out among several
uses. Drawing on the power of the spell is a standard action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This spell does
not allow the subject to cure others.
If the target creature uses up its allotted healing before
the duration elapses, the spell immediately ends. If any
curing power remains available when the spell ends, that
curing is immediately applied to the subject.
Special: A character with any Mark of Healing dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat ( Jorasco), casts this
spell at +1 caster level.

# 102

SLAYING ARROW
Transmutation [see text]
Level: Artifi cer 5
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Arrow or bolt touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: None (object) or Fortitude negates; see
text
Spell Resistance: No (object)
An arrow or bolt imbued with this infusion becomes
extremely deadly against creatures of a type specifi ed when
the infusion is cast (such as dragons or outsiders), and also
gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage
rolls. If the imbued projectile successfully hits a creature
of the type to which it is keyed, the target must make a Fortitude
save or die (or, in the case of an unliving target, be
destroyed). Even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude
saves, such as undead and constructs, are subject to this
effect. If the save is successful, the target takes no additional
damage beyond the actual projectile.
When keyed to a living creature (as opposed to a construct
or undead), this is a death effect.
Material Component: A drop of viper blood.
SPEAKING STONES
Transmutation
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Two normal objects touched, weighing up to 1 lb.
each
Duration: 24 hours or until discharged; see text
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
This spell allows you to fashion a magical link between two
stones (or any other mundane, nonmagical objects weighing
up to 1 pound each). This link allows each stone to pass a
single message to the other, no matter how great the distance
between them after the spell is fi rst cast.
Once the stones are transmuted with this spell, a
creature holding one stone can send a message of no more
than twenty-fi ve words as a standard action. The message
instantly sounds from the other stone, loud enough to be
heard by anyone within 5 feet of it. The spell ends after each
stone passes one message to its twin, or the spell’s duration
elapses, whichever occurs fi rst.
Messages are not transmitted across planar boundaries.
If the bearer of one speaking stone attempts to pass a message
while the other stone is on another plane, the message
rebounds and plays back on the original stone. This playback
counts as that stone’s single message transmission.
No object can have more than one speaking stones spell cast
upon it. A second speaking stones cast upon the same object ends
the fi rst spell.
Special: A character with any Mark of Scribing dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Sivis), can send a
message of up to 100 words through any object upon which
she has cast this spell.
SPELL SNARE
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 3, sorcerer/wizard 4
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: Eberron dragonshard touched
Duration: 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw: None (object)
Spell Resistance: No (object)
A spell snare takes advantage of an Eberron dragonshard’s
innate magical affi nity, tuning the shard so that it readily
absorbs the energy of a spell. The next spell or spelllike
ability of 3rd level or lower that targets the bearer
of the spell snare is absorbed into the dragonshard and has
no effect. Only spells or spell-like abilities that affect a
single target, or orb or ray spells directed at the bearer,
can be absorbed. Once the spell snare has absorbed a spell,
its magic expires and the dragonshard disintegrates. It
requires no action to absorb a spell, but you must have the
dragonshard in hand.
A spell snare does not discriminate between harmful
or benefi cial spells, and will just as readily absorb a cure
light wounds spell as vampiric touch (though a character could
temporarily put away or set aside the spell snare to receive a
benefi cial spell).
A character can only benefi t from one spell snare at any
given time. If more than one affected shard is carried, they
will all activate (and be destroyed) by the fi rst spell to target
the bearer.
Material Component: An Eberron dragonshard worth at
least 25 gp. Unlike most material components, the dragonshard
is consumed when the spell snare effect functions, not
when the spell is cast.
SPELL SNARE, GREATER
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 6, sorcerer/wizard 7
As spell snare, except that the dragonshard component of
this spell can absorb a spell or spell-like ability of up to
6th level.
Material Component: An Eberron dragonshard worth
at least 100 gp. Unlike most material components, the dragonshard is consumed when the spell snare effect functions,
not when the spell is cast.

# 103

STORM TOUCH
Evocation [Electricity]
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Targets: Up to one creature/level touched
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes
Your hand crackles with the pent-up energy of storm-tossed
lightning, dealing 9d6 points of electricity damage with a
successful melee touch attack. Touched creatures are also
stunned for 1 round by the burning pain unless they make
a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee
touch attack up to one time per level.
Special: A character with any Mark of Storm dragonmark,
or with the Favored in House feat (Lyrandar), deals
an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage with each touch.
SUFFER THE FLESH
Transmutation
Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round
You can draw upon your physical endurance to increase
the power of your spells. You voluntarily deal Constitution
damage to yourself when you cast this spell. For each
2 points of damage dealt, your caster level increases by 1.
You cannot take more Constitution damage than your caster
level (maximum 10 points for a +5 caster level increase).
Your maximum and current hit points drop appropriately
for your lower Constitution score. A creature
that has no Constitution score, or that has immunity to
Constitution damage, cannot cast this spell.
Material Component: A ruby worth 250 gp.
SUPPRESS DRAGONMARK
Abjuration
Level: Artifi cer 2, sorcerer/wizard 2
Components: S, F
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One dragonmarked creature
Duration: 24 hours
Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: No
Using an inversely charged Siberys dragonshard, this
spell absorbs the magical energy of the target creature’s
dragonmark. In casting the spell, you must touch the target
creature with the charged dragonshard, requiring either a
ranged or melee touch attack. If the creature is struck by
the Siberys shard and fails its Will save, it loses the ability
to use any spell-like abilities granted by its dragonmark for
the duration of the spell.
Focus: A Siberys dragonshard worth at least 25 gp and
inversely tuned, a process requiring 1 hour of uninterrupted
concentration. Once the spell is cast, the inverse
tuning must be repeated for the focus to work again.
UNDYING AURA
Transmutation
Level: Cleric 5
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Living creature touched
Duration: 1 minute/level or until discharged
Saving Throw: Will partial
Spell Resistance: Yes
Undying aura wreathes the target creature in a golden shield
of positive energy, granting it immunity to death effects,
energy drain effects, and any negative energy effects (such
as from chill touch or an infl ict spell).
Any time during the spell’s duration, the target can
release the power of the aura by making a melee touch attack
against an undead creature. On a successful attack, the aura
pulses angrily as it tears apart the negative energy sustaining
the creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level
(maximum 15d6) and dazing it for 1 round. A successful
Will save halves the damage and negates the daze effect.
Since the spell utilizes positive energy to deal damage,
incorporeal creatures do not benefi t from the normal miss
chance for incorporeality. Using the touch attack ends the
spell’s duration.
A deathless creature (see page 275 of the EBERRON Campaign
Setting) targeted by the touch attack power of this spell
is instead healed of 1d6 points of damage per caster level
(maximum 15d6). Some suggest that this indicates the spell
was originally designed by the Aereni, and the name of the
spell seems to support this claim.
Focus: A clear spar of crystal worth 500 gp.
WATCHFUL ANCESTORS
Conjuration (Summoning)
Level: Bard 4, cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4
Components: V, S, M/DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 minute/level
You are surrounded by manifestations of the spirits of
your long-dead ancestors, which provide you with protection
in battle. Opponents gain no bonus from fl anking
you, as if you had the improved uncanny dodge ability
(see the barbarian class feature on page 26 of the Player’s
Handbook; use your caster level in place of barbarian levels
for the purpose of determining whether a rogue can sneak
attack you).
In addition, while this spell is in effect, you add your
caster level as an insight bonus on any one Refl ex save. Using
this function is an immediate action and must be declared
before the save is rolled. Using this ability immediately ends the spell, since the protective manifestations expend themselves
to provide you with the sudden burst of insight.
Arcane Material Component: A shred of a burial shroud.

# 104

WIND’S FAVOR
Transmutation [Air]
Level: Druid 3
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Area of wind 10 ft. wide by 10 ft. high by 100 ft. +
10 ft./level long
Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
You create a localized area of strong wind (approximately
30 mph). This effect has limited utility in battle (see Table
3–24: Wind Effects, page 95 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide),
but is often used to propel sailing craft. By concentrating
as a full-round action, you can change the direction of the
wind by 45 degrees.
This spell is effectively identical to the spell-like
ability that can be gained by a character with the lesser
Mark of Storm (see page 66 of the EBERRON Campaign Setting),
except the range and the affected area are different, as
given above.
