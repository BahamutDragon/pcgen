Psi-Like Abilities		KEY:Kalashtar ~ Psi-Like Abilities	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Kalashtar Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:Mindlink (1/day). This ability is like the power manifested by a wilder of 1/2 the kalashtar's Hit Dice (minimum 1st level). If you are not using the Expanded Psionics Handbook in your game, use this description of the mindlink power: You forge a telepathic bond with another creature within 30 feet, which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. The bond can be established only with a willing subject, who therefore receives no saving throw and gains no benefit from spell resistance. You can communicate telepathically through the bond even if you do not share a common language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another), but only lasts for 1 round per character level. This is a mind-affecting ability.

Shifter Racial Traits								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Shifter Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:&nl;Shapechanger Subtype: Shifters are humanoids with the shapechanger subtype.	DESC:&nl;+2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Shifters are lithe and agile, but their fundamental bestial nature detracts from both their reasoning ability and their social interaction.	DESC:&nl;Medium: As Medium creatures, shifters have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.	DESC:&nl;Shifter base land speed is 30 feet.	DESC:&nl;Shifting (Su): A shifter can tap into her lycanthropic heritage to gain short bursts of physical power. Once per day, a shifter can enter a state that is superficially similar to a barbarian's rage. Each shifter has one of six shifter traits-characteristics that manifest themselves when a character is shifting. Each shifter trait provides a +2 bonus to one of the character's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) and grants some other advantage as well. Shifter traits are described in the following section. Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shifter's Con modifier. (If a shifter trait or other effect increases the character's Con modifier, use the newly improved modifier.) A shifter can take feats to improve this ability. These shifter feats are described in Chapter 3: Heroic Characteristics. Every shifter feat a character takes in creases the duration of shifting by 1 round. For every two shifter feats a character takes, the number of times per day she can tap into the ability increases by one. So, a character with two shifter feats can shift two times per day (instead of the usual one), and each use of the ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 (instead of 3) + the shifter's Con modifier. Shifting, though related to and developed from lycanthropy, is neither an aff liction nor a curse. It is not passed on by bite or claw attacks, and a shifter can't be cured-shifting is a natural ability for the race.	DESC:&nl;Low-Light Vision: Shifters can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.	DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks: A shifter's animalistic heritage enhances many of her physical skills.	DESC:&nl;Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages: Elven, Gnome, Halfling, and Sylvan.	DESC:&nl;Favored Class: Ranger. A multiclass shifter's ranger class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.												SOURCEPAGE:p.19

She cannot attack more than once per round with her bite, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks.

These claws deal 1d4 points of damage (plus an additional +1 for every four character levels she has) with each successful attack. She can attack with one claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack action (as a primary natural weapon). She can not attack more than once per round with a single claw, even if her base attack bonus is high enough to give her multiple attacks. She can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while wielding a weapon in her primary hand, but all her attacks in that round take a -2 penalty.

SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Wildhunt						KEY:Shifter Traits ~ Wildhunt							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.ShifterSelection.SpecialQuality																		DESC:While shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and the scent ability. This ability allows the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can identify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights. A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait. When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location of the source isn't revealed-only its presence somewhere within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within 5 feet of the source, she pinpoints the source's location. While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the Track feat can follow tracks by smell, making Survival checks to find or follow a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the surface that holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures producing the odor, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail grows cold, the DC increases by 2. This ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Shifters tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility. When not shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus on Survival checks due to the lingering effects of the scent ability.

# Warforged
Living Construct Subtype				KEY:Warforged ~ Living Construct Subtype		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	DESC:Warforged are constructs with the living construct subtype. A living construct is a created being given sentience and free will through powerful and complex creation enchantments. Warforged are living constructs that combine aspects of both constructs and living creatures, as detailed below.
Features							KEY:Warforged ~ Features				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.23	DESC:As a living construct, a warforged has the following features. -A warforged derives its Hit Dice, base attack bonus progression, saving throws, and skill points from the class it selects. Traits: A warforged possesses the following traits. -Unlike other constructs, a warforged has a Constitution score. -Unlike other constructs, a warforged does not have low-light vision or darkvision. -Unlike other constructs, a warforged is not immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities. -Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, effects that cause the sickened condition, and energy drain. -A warforged cannot heal damage naturally. -Unlike other constructs, warforged are subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, stunning, ability damage, ability drain, and death effects or necromancy effects. -As living constructs, warforged can be affected by spells that target living creatures as well as by those that target constructs. Damage dealt to a warforged can be healed by a cure light wounds spell or a repair light damage spell, for example, and a warforged is vulnerable to disable construct and harm. However, spells from the healing subschool and supernatural abilities that cure hit point damage or ability damage provide only half their normal effect to a warforged. -The unusual physical construction of warforged makes them vulnerable to certain spells and effects that normally don't affect living creatures. A warforged takes damage from heat metal and chill metal as if he were wearing metal armor. Likewise, a warforged is affected by repel metal or stone as if he were wearing metal armor. A warforged is repelled by repel wood. The iron in the body of a warforged makes him vulnerable to rusting grasp. The creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the spell (Refl ex half; save DC 14 + caster's ability modifi er). A warforged takes the same damage from a rust monster's touch (Refl ex DC 17 half). Spells such as stone to flesh, stone shape, warp wood, and wood shape affect objects only, and thus cannot be used on the stone and wood parts of a warforged. -A warforged responds slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A warforged with 0 hit points is disabled, just like a living creature. He can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. When his hit points are less than 0 and greater than -10, a warforged is inert. He is unconscious and helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an inert warforged does not lose additional hit points unless more damage is dealt to him, as with a living creature that is stable. -As a living construct, a warforged can be raised or resurrected. -A warforged does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but he can still benefi t from the effects of consumable spells and magic items such as heroes' feast and potions. -Although living constructs do not need to sleep, a warforged wizard must rest for 8 hours before preparing spells.
+2 Constitution, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma		KEY:Warforged ~ Stats					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.23	DESC:Warforged are resilient and powerful, but their diffi culty in relating to other creatures makes them seem aloof or even hostile.
Medium							KEY:Warforged ~ Size					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.23	DESC:As Medium constructs, warforged have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
Warforged base land speed is 30 feet.		KEY:Warforged ~ Move					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Composite Plating						KEY:Warforged ~ Composite Plating			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.23	DESC:The plating used to build a warforged provides a +2 armor bonus. This plating is not natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same space on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus a warforged cannot wear armor or magic robes. Warforged can be enchanted just as armor can be. The character must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant him. Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5%% arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for wearing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged to ignore the arcane spell failure chance for light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.
Light Fortification					KEY:Warforged ~ Light Fortification			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a warforged, there is a 25%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.
Natural Attacks						KEY:Warforged ~ Natural Attacks			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:A warforged has a natural weapon in the form of a slam attack that deals 1d4 points of damage.
Automatic Languages					KEY:Warforged ~ Automatic Languages			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:Common.	AUTO:LANG|Common

Favored Class						KEY:Warforged ~ Favored Class				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:Fighter. A multiclass warforged's fighter class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

# Artificer
Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Artificer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:Artificers are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=ArmorProfMedium|TYPE=ShieldProf|TYPE=WeaponProfSimple																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Infusions						KEY:Artificer ~ Infusions							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:An artificer is not a spellcaster, but he does have the ability to imbue items with magical infusions. Infusions are neither arcane nor divine; they are drawn from the artificer infusion list (see Chapter 5: Magic). They function just like spells and follow all the rules for spells. For example, an infusion can be dispelled, it will not function in an antimagic area, and an artificer must make a Concentration check if injured while imbuing an item with an infusion. An artificer can imbue an item with any infusion from the list without preparing the infusion ahead of time. Unlike a sorcerer or bard, he does not select a subset of the available infusions as his known infusions; he has access to every infusion on the list that is of a level he can use. It is possible for an artificer to learn infusions that are not on the normal artificer infusion list. These might include ancient infusions he finds in the ruins of Xen'drik or secret infusions known only to the members of certain guilds or organizations. When he encounters such an infusion, an artificer can attempt to learn it by making a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). If this check succeeds, he adds the infusion to his list. If not, he can try again when he gains another rank in Spellcraft, assuming he still has access to the new infusion. To imbue an item with an infusion, an artificer must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the infusion level (Int 11 for 1st-level infusions, Int 12 for 2nd-level infusions, and so forth). Infusions never allow saving throws. Like spellcasters, an artificer can use only a certain number of infusions of a particular level per day. His base daily infusion allotment is given on the accompanying table. In addition, he receives extra infusions per day if he has a sufficiently high Intelligence score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). An artificer's infusions can only be imbued into an item or a construct (including warforged). He can not, for example, simply imbue an ally with bull's strength. He must instead imbue that ability into an item his ally is wearing. The item then functions as a belt of giant strength for the duration of the infusion. He can, however, imbue bull's strength directly on a construct or a character with the living construct subtype, and infusions such as repair light damage and iron construct function only when imbued on such characters. Many infusions have long casting times, often 1 minute or more. An artificer can spend 1 action point to imbue any infusion in 1 round (like a spell that takes 1 round to cast). Like a spellcaster, an artificer can apply item creation feats and metamagic feats to his infusions. Like a sorcerer, an artificer can apply a metamagic feat to an infusion spontaneously, but doing this requires extra time. An artificer can craft alchemical items as though he were a spellcaster. An artificer cannot automatically use a spell trigger or spell completion item if the equivalent spell appears on his infusion list. For example, an artificer must still employ the Use Magic Device skill to use a wand of light, even though light appears on his infusion list. Each day, an artificer must focus his mind on his infusions. He needs 8 hours of rest, after which he spends 15 minutes concentrating. During this period, the artifi- cer readies his mind to hold his daily allotment of infusions. Without such a period of time to refresh himself, the character does not regain the infusion slots he used up the day before. Any infusions used within the last 8 hours count against the artificer's daily limit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Craft Reserve					KEY:Artificer ~ Craft Reserve							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality													DEFINE:CraftPointReserve|0		DESC:An artificer receives a pool of points he can spend instead of experience points when crafting a magic item. Each time the artificer gains a new level, he receives a new craft reserve; leftover points from the previous level do not carry over. If the points are not spent, they are lost. An artificer can also use his craft reserve to supplement the XP cost of the item he is making, taking a portion of the cost from his craft reserve and a portion from his own XP.

Artificer Knowledge				KEY:Artificer ~ Artificer Knowledge						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:An artificer can make a special artificer knowledge check with a bonus equal to his artificer level + his Int modifier to detect whether a specific item has a magical aura. The artificer must hold and examine the object for 1 minute. A successful check against DC 15 determines that the object has magical qualities, but does not reveal the specific powers of the item. An artificer cannot take 10 or take 20 on this check. A particular item can only be examined in this fashion one time; if the check fails, the artificer can learn no more about that object.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Artisan Bonus					KEY:Artificer ~ Artisan Bonus							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:An artificer gains a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks to activate an item of a kind for which he has the prerequisite item creation feat. For example, an artificer who has the Craft Wand feat gains a +2 bonus on checks to use a spell from a wand.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Disable Trap					KEY:Artificer ~ Disable Trap							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:An artificer can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create the trap. An artificer can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. Usually the DC is 25 + the level of the spell used to create the trap. An artificer who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with his party) without disarming it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Item Creation					KEY:Artificer ~ Item Creation							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:An artificer can create a magic item even if he does not have access to the spells that are prerequisites for the item. The artificer must make a successful Use Magic Device check (DC 20 + caster level) to emulate each spell normally required to create the item. Thus, to make a 1st-level wand of magic missile, an artificer would need a Use Magic Device check result of 21 or higher. To create a bottle of air (caster level 7th), he would need a check result of 27 or higher to emulate the water breathing prerequisite. The artificer must make a successful check for each prerequisite for each item he makes. If he fails a check, he can try again each day until the item is complete (see Creating Magic Items, page 282 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If he comes to the end of the crafting time and he has still not successfully emulated one of the powers, he can make one final check-his last-ditch effort, even if he has already made a check that day. If that check also fails, then the creation process fails and the time, money, and XP expended to craft the item are lost. For purposes of meeting item prerequisites, an artificer's effective caster level equals his artificer level +2. If the item duplicates a spell effect, however, it uses the artificer's actual level as its caster level. Costs are always determined using the item's minimum caster level or the artificer's actual level (if it is higher). Thus, a 3rd-level artificer can make a scroll of fireball, since the minimum caster level for fireball is 5th. He pays the normal cost for making such a scroll with a caster level of 5th: 5 ? 3 ? 12.5 = 187 gp and 5 sp, plus 15 XP. But the scroll's actual caster level is only 3rd, and it produces a weak fireball that deals only 3d6 points of damage. An artificer can also make Use Magic Device checks to emulate nonspell requirements, including alignment and race, using the normal DCs for the skill. He cannot emulate skill or feat requirements, however, including item creation feat prerequisites. He must meet the caster level prerequisite, including the minimum level to cast a spell he stores in a potion, wand, or scroll. An artificer's infusions do not meet spell prerequisites for creating magic items. For example, an artificer must still employ the Use Magic Device skill to emulate the light spell to create a wand of light, even though light appears on his infusion list.

In addition, an artificer gains a bonus feat at 4th level and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th). For each of these bonus feats, the artificer must choose a metamagic feat or a feat from the following list: Attune Magic Weapon, Craft Construct (see the Monster Manual, page 303), Exceptional Artisan, Extra Rings, Extraordinary Artisan, Legendary Artisan, Wand Mastery.

Craft Homunculus					KEY:Artificer ~ Craft Homunculus						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 4th level, an artificer can create a homunculus as if he had the Craft Construct feat. He must emulate the spell requirements (arcane eye, mending, and mirror image) as normal for making a magic item, and he must pay all the usual gold and XP costs (though he can spend points from his craft reserve). An artificer can also upgrade an existing homunculus that he owns, adding 1 Hit Die at a cost of 2,000 gp and 160 XP. If an artificer gives his homunculus more than 6 Hit Dice, it becomes a Small creature and advances as described in the Monster Manual (+4 Str, -2 Dex, damage increases to 1d6). The homunculus also gains 10 extra hit points for being a Small construct. An artificer's homunculus can have as many Hit Dice as its master's Hit Dice minus 2. No matter how many Hit Dice it has, a homunculus never grows larger than Small.

Retain Essence					KEY:Artificer ~ Retain Essence						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 5th level, an artificer gains the ability to salvage the XP from a magic item and use those points to create another magic item. The artificer must spend a day with the item, and he must also have the appropriate item creation feat for the item he is salvaging. After one day, the item is destroyed and the artificer adds the XP it took to create the item to his craft reserve. These points are lost if the artificer does not use them before gaining his next level. For example, an artificer wants to retain the essence of a wand of summon monster IV that has 20 charges. Originally created (like all wands) with 50 charges, it required 840 XP when initially made, or 16.8 XP (840 ? 50) per charge. The artificer is able to recover the XP from the remaining charges. He puts 336 XP (16.8 ? 20) into his craft reserve.

Metamagic Spell Trigger				KEY:Artificer ~ Metamagic Spell Trigger					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 6th level, an artificer gains the ability to apply a metamagic feat he knows to a spell trigger item (generally a wand). He must have the appropriate item creation feat for the spell trigger item he is using. Using this ability expends additional charges from the item equal to the number of effective spell levels the metamagic feat would add to a spell. For example, an artificer can quicken a spell cast from a wand by spending 5 charges (4 additional charges), empower the spell by spending 3 charges, or trigger it silently by spending 2 charges. The Still Spell feat confers no benefit when applied to a spell trigger item. An artificer cannot use this ability when using a spell trigger item that does not have charges, such as prayer beads.

Metamagic Spell Completion			KEY:Artificer ~ Metamagic Spell Completion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Artificer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 11th level, an artificer gains the ability to apply a metamagic feat he knows to a spell completion item (generally a scroll). He must have the appropriate item creation feat for the spell completion item he is using. The DC for the Use Magic Device check is equal to 20 + (3 ? the modified level of the spell). For example, applying the Empower Spell feat to a scroll of cone of cold, creating a 7th-level effect, has a DC of 20 + (3 ? 7), or 41. An artificer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Int modifier.

They consider arcane and divine magic to be unnatural, for example, and go out of their way to strike at farms and ranches that attempt to confine or cultivate nature. The Ashbound prefer to avoid killing; their goal is to encourage their targets to abandon their unnatural ways and embrace the harmony of nature.

The exorcist makes a Charisma check and consults Table 8-9: Turning Undead, page 159 of the Player's Handbook, using her character level to determine the most powerful outsider she can affect. She then rolls 2d6 + her level in this class + her Cha modifier for turning damage. Using both her character level and class level in this manner means that she is more likely to affect a single powerful outsider, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. A censured outsider is stunned for 1 round by the power of the Silver Flame channeled through the exorcist. If the exorcist's character level is at least twice the outsider's Hit Dice, she banishes the outsider back to its home plane.

Frightful Shifting				KEY:Weretouched Master ~ Frightful Shifting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Weretouched Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 4th level, a weretouched master gains an unsettling presence when he uses his shifting ability or his alternate form ability. When he attacks or charges, opponents within 30 feet who witness his attack may become shaken for 5d6 rounds. This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the weretouched master's character level. An opponent can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + weretouched master's class level + his Cha modifier). An opponent who succeeds on the saving throw is immune to that weretouched master's frightful shifting for 24 hours. Frightful shifting is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Alternate Form					KEY:Weretouched Master ~ Alternate Form					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Weretouched Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 5th level, a weretouched master can assume the animal form or hybrid form related to his lycanthrope heritage (the same animal selected at 1st level). Instead of using his normal shifting ability, he can shift into animal form as though using the polymorph spell on himself, though his gear is not affected, he does not regain hit points for changing form, and only the specific animal form indicated for the lycanthrope heritage can be assumed. The weretouched master does not assume the ability scores of the animal, but instead adds the animal's ability adjustments (see the following table) to his own ability scores. A weretouched master can also assume a bipedal hybrid form with prehensile hands and animalistic features. In hybrid form, he can use weapons and armor. A slain weretouched master reverts to his humanoid form, although he remains dead. Separated body parts retain their animal form, however. &nl;Animal Ability Adjustments (Animal or Hybrid Form) &nl;Bear Str +16, Dex +2, Con +8 &nl;Boar Str +4, Con +6 &nl;Rat Dex +6, Con +2 &nl;Tiger Str +12, Dex +4, Con +6 &nl;Wolf Str +2, Dex +4, Con +4 &nl;Wolverine Str +4, Dex +4, Con +8																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.86

MULT:YES	CHOOSE:CLASS|TYPE=Base|TYPE=PC							ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Monastic Training (%LIST)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												BENEFIT:Pick one class. Taking levels in this class does not prevent you from taking monk levels. If you take levels in any other class, you lose your ability to progress as a monk as usual. If the selected class also has restricted advancement, such as the paladin class, taking monk levels does not prevent you from advancing in that class.
