Using a ray attack is a standard action. The ray affects one living creature, clouding his mind so that he takes no actions.

Your campaign may include additional types of deathless creatures. Your DM will inform you if you can create different creatures with this spell. No spell can create an ascendant councilor. Materials:A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with pure water. The spell must be cast on a dead body. You must place a moonstone gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the deathless to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless shells.

Your campaign may include additional types of deathless creatures. Your DM will inform you if you can create different creatures with this spell. (For example, if you are using Book of Exalted Deeds, a character can create a crypt warden or a sacred guardian using this spell.) No spell can create an ascendant councilor.
Detect Aberration											CLASSES:Druid=1[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Gatekeeper Initiate]												SCHOOL:Divination											COMPS:V, S, DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:60 ft.	TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped emanation																																		DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)		SAVEINFO:None																																					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:You can detect the presence of aberrations by observing the disruption of the natural order around them. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of aberrations. 2nd Round: Number of aberrations in the area and the strength of the strongest aberration's aura. If the strongest aberration aura's strength is overwhelming (see below) and the creature h as HD of at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aberration's aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Strength: The strength of an aberration's aura is determined by the HD of the aberration, as given on the following table: Unlike similar spells, detect aberration does not reveal lingering auras. Each round, you can turn to detect aberrations in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detoxify																										DOMAINS:Feast=8			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Healing							COMPS:V, S, DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.	TARGETAREA:Creatures and objects in 30-ft.-radius spread																														DURATION:Instantaneous and 10 min./level; see text	SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)																																		SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:You detoxify any sort of venom within 30 feet of you. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own. This effect is instantaneous; no immunity to later poisoning is conveyed by the spell. The venom of any creatures affected by the spell loses its potency for 10 minutes per caster level. Any poison in the air, in food, on weapons or traps, or otherwise in the radius of the spell is instantaneously neutralized.
Disable Construct											CLASSES:Artificer=6																SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Construct touched																																			DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will half; see text																																			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:Disable construct transmutes the structure of a construct to deal 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level).

For example, you could change a +2 flaming battleaxe to a +2 frost battleaxe or a ring of minor energ y resistance (acid) to a ring of minor energ y resistance (sonic). The amount of damage dealt by energy, protection offered from energy, and all other effects remain the same. Material Component: An alchemical ointment formed from materials representing all five energy types and costing 50 gp.
Enhancement Alteration										CLASSES:Artificer=1																SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:S			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Weapon or shield touched																																		DURATION:10 min./level (D)					SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)																																		SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:This spell has two distinct versions, both involving an alteration of an existing enhancement bonus. If you imbue a shield with this infusion, some or all of its enhancement bonus applies to shield bash attacks made with the shield instead of to the wielder's shield bonus to Armor Class. You can choose any portion of its enhancement bonus to shift in this fashion. If you imbue a weapon with this infusion, some or all of its enhancement bonus applies to the wielder's Armor Class if he chooses to fight defensively, uses the total defense action, uses the Combat Expertise feat, or uses the weapon in his off hand and has the Two- Weapon Defense feat. The enhancement bonus you shift no longer applies to the wielder's attack rolls and damage rolls with the weapon. As with the shield version, you can choose any portion of its enhancement bonus to shift in this fashion. If the weapon or shield is attended, the wielder can make a Will saving throw to negate the effect.
Feast of Champions										CLASSES:Cleric=9												DOMAINS:Feast=9			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V, S, DF		CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Feast for one creature/level																																	DURATION:1 hour plus 12 hours; see text			SAVEINFO:None																																					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:You bring forth a magnificent feast, including a grand table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all diseases, sickness, nausea, fatigue, and exhaustion. Any poison affecting a creature is neutralized, and creatures sharing the feast become immune to poison for 12 hours. The nectarlike beverage that is part of the feast cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20) and grants 1d8 temporary hit points + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). The food of the feast grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws, and immunity to fear effects for 12 hours. If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects are negated.
Halt Deathless																									DOMAINS:Deathless=3		SCHOOL:Necromancy											COMPS:V, S, DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Up to three deathless, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart																										DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates																																				SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:This spell renders up to three deathless creatures immobile. If the spell is successful, it renders the deathless paralyzed for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of hold person on a living creature). The effect is broken if the halted creatures are attacked or take damage.
Hardening												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6|Artificer=7								DOMAINS:Artificer=6		SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:One item of a volume no greater than 10 cu. ft./																														DURATION:Permanent						SAVEINFO:None																																					SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:DESC:This spell increases the hardness of materials. Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more durable, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material's resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have a new hardness of 16 for purposes of ignoring damage caused by an opponent's successful sunder attempt. The sword's hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. The hardening spell does not in any way affect the item's resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on. This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet of material per level of the caster. If cast upon a metal or mineral, the volume is reduced to 1 cubic feet per level.
Hero's Blade																									DOMAINS:Deathless=9		SCHOOL:Necromancy											COMPS:V, DF			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Melee weapon touched																																		DURATION:1 min./level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)																																	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:You channel the spirit of a mighty elf hero of old into a melee weapon. For the duration of the spell, the weapon gains the following benefits. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to evil creatures, or an extra 2d8 points of damage to evil outsiders and undead. On a critical hit, the weapon deals an extra 2d10 points of damage to evil creatures or an extra 2d12 points of damage to evil outsiders and undead. (Against undead, the weapon damage is not multiplied on a critical hit, but the undead creature still takes increased damage from this effect. Other creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits do not take extra damage from this effect.) The weapon becomes good-aligned, allowing it to overcome the damage reduction of certain evil creatures. The weapon's threat range doubles, as though it were affected by a keen edge spell (this does not stack with the benefit of the keen special ability or the keen edge spell, but does stack with the benefit of the Improved Critical feat). When it scores a critical hit against an evil foe, the weapon blinds and deafens the opponent for 1d4 rounds (a successful Will save negates the blindness). Spell resistance applies to this effect. When the weapon scores a critical hit against an evil extraplanar creature, the creature must make a successful Will save or be instantly banished back to its home plane. A creature so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. Spell resistance applies to this effect.
Inflict Critical Damage										CLASSES:Artificer=4																SCHOOL:Transmutation																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:As inf lict light damage, except inf lict critical damage deals 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

Iron Construct											CLASSES:Artificer=4																SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:S, M			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Construct touched																																			DURATION:1 min./level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)																																		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You transform an existing construct into a powerhouse of hardened iron, similar to the effect of the iron body spell. The construct gains damage reduction 15/adamantine. It takes half damage from acid and fire attacks of all kinds. Even if it is not a golem, however, it becomes vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems. The construct gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity of 1). The construct's weight increases by a factor of five. Material Component: A small piece of iron that was once part of an iron golem, a hero's armor, or a war machine.
Item Alteration											CLASSES:Artificer=4																SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:S			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Magic item touched																																			DURATION:10 min./level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)																																		SPELLRES:Yes (object)			SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You alter an item that provides a certain type of bonus so that it provides a different type of bonus to the same value or roll. For example, you could change a ring of protection +1 so that it provided a natural armor bonus to Armor Class instead of a deflection bonus, or you could change a cloak of resistance so that it provided a circumstance bonus on saves instead of a resistance bonus. You cannot use this infusion to change an item so that it provides a sacred or profane bonus, nor can you change an item that already does so to make it provide a different kind of bonus. You also cannot make an item provide a dodge bonus to Armor Class.
Maddening Scream											CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8										DOMAINS:Madness=8			SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																																		DURATION:1d4+1 rounds						SAVEINFO:None																																					SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:The subject cannot keep from screaming, gibbering, and leaping about as though completely mad. This spell makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than race about caterwauling. The Armor Class of the creature takes a -4 penalty, it succeeds on Reflex saving throws only on a roll of 20, and it does not benefit from any shield it may be bearing.
Magecraft												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1															SCHOOL:Divination											COMPS:V, F			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You																																					DURATION:1 day																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You get a +5 competence bonus on one Craft check representing a day of work crafting an item.

For the duration of this infusion, anyone who casts that spell from the item gains the benefit of that metamagic feat. For example, you could imbue a wand of fireballs with the Empower Spell feat or apply the Maximize Spell feat to the cone of cold spell in a staff of frost.

Creatures that are a part of the natural world are unaffected; aberrations, undead, and similar corruptions of nature are harmed by the spell. The spell deals damage to creatures of certain types within its area. Animals, constructs, elementals, fey, outsiders with an elemental subtype (air, earth, fire, or water), oozes, plants, vermin, and inanimate objects are unharmed by the spell. Aberrations take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and are dazed for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect. Creatures of other types (dragons, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, and outsiders with no elemental subtype) take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). A successful Will save reduces the damage to half.

Humanoids who are arcane spellcasters, as well as all monstrous humanoids, gain 1d4 negative levels when subjected to this spell. Giants subjected to this spell become smaller, as though affected by a reduce person spell (see page 269 of the Player's Handbook). A successful Fortitude save negates this effect.
