Aberrant Dragonmark		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																										PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonmarked,Human%,Dwarf%,Elf%,Gnome%,Halfling%,Half-Orc%																									DESC:Although you are not a recognized member of one of the dragonmarked families, you have manifested a dragonmark.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:This feat provides you with a single dragonmark spell-like ability that is not directly tied to the trueborn dragonmarked houses. All aberrant mark spell-like abilities can be used once per day. When you select this feat, you must choose an aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability from the following list. You can never improve this mark in any way, and you can never gain a second mark. A character with one of the true marks (least, lesser, or greater) cannot select this feat, and a character with this feat cannot later select one of the true dragonmark feats. A saving throw against your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability has a DC of 10 + spell level + your Cha modifier. (Spell level for an aberrant dragonmark is always 1st.) Your caster level for your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability is one-half your character level. Aberrant Mark Powers: burning hands, cause fear, charm person, chill touch, detect secret doors, feather fall, inflict light wounds, jump, light, pass without trace, produce flame, shield, Tenser's floating disk. Aberrant dragonmarks are mutations that appear occasionally among the dragonmarked races (usually to those not of a dragonmarked house) that can be traced back to the bloodlines of corrupted dragonmarked families eliminated in the War of the Mark. At a quick glance, an aberrant mark could be mistaken for an established dragonmark, but on close inspection its differences are readily apparent.

SOURCEPAGE:p.47	BENEFIT:When you spend an action point to alter the result of an attack roll, a skill check, an ability check, a level check, or a saving throw, you roll d8s instead of d6s and add the result to the d20 roll.

Warforged druids who take this feat cannot cast druid spells or use any of the druid's supernatural or spell-like class features. Warforged characters with this feat do not gain the benefit of any class feature prohibited to a character wearing heavy armor.

DESC:You have been trained in the druidic traditions of the Ashbound, seeing yourself as one of nature's avengers. You consider the use of arcane magic to be a vile and unnatural act.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:The duration of your summon nature's ally spells is doubled. Creatures summoned by those spells receive a +3 luck bonus on their attack rolls.
Attune Magic Weapon		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation.Item Creation																PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Magic Arms and Armor															PRETEXT:Craft Magic Arms and Armor, caster level 5th.

Bind Elemental			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation.Item Creation																																					PRETEXT:Craft Wondrous Item, caster level 9th.																	DESC:You can craft magic items that use bound elementals for special effects, including weapons, armor, airships, and elemental galleons.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:Crafting an item with a bound elemental is similar to making a wondrous item, except that calling and binding an elemental is an integral part of creating the item. All bound-elemental items have a planar binding spell as a prerequisite, but simply casting the spell as part of the item creation is not sufficient. You must cast the spell normally, using the item that is to hold the elemental and a Khyber dragonshard as a receptacle. The elemental receives its normal saving throw to resist. While the elemental resides in the receptacle, you must compel it to accept bondage in the item by making an opposed Charisma check, as specified in the lesser planar binding spell description. If you are an artificer, this feat allows you to cast a planar binding spell by successfully emulating it with a Use Magic Device check (DC 20 + caster level), but only when you attempt to craft a bound-elemental item. In this case, your effective caster level equals your Use Magic Device check result -20 for the purpose of opposing the elemental's attempts to escape. See pages 265-267 for examples of bound-elemental items and vessels.

DESC:You call upon the power of your dragon totem to enhance your barbarian rage.

This benefit represents your ability to learn details about any community from the clergy of its churches. In addition, if you take the Leadership feat, you gain a +2 bonus to your Leadership score.
Education				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:1st level only.																					DESC:Some lands hold the pen in higher regard than the sword. In your youth, you received the benefit of several years of formal schooling.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.52	BENEFIT:All Knowledge skills are class skills for you. You get a +1 bonus on all checks with any two Knowledge skills of your choice.

DESC:Your familiarity with forging magic rings allows you to make use of more rings than normal.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.53	BENEFIT:You can wear up to four magic rings, two on each hand, and all function normally. Normal: Without this feat, you can only wear and use two magic rings at one time.

DESC:You are an expert at creating magic items at a lower cost than usual.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.53	BENEFIT:When determining the gold piece cost in raw materials you need to craft any item, reduce the base price by 25%%.
Favored In House			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Member of appropriate dragonmarked race and house.															DESC:You are a member of one of the dragonmarked mercantile houses and wield some influence in that house.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.53	BENEFIT:Your family is influential and powerful, and you have the ability to call in favors from other members of your family and their extensive contacts. By making a favor check (see below), you can call upon contacts to gain important information without going through the time and trouble of a Gather Information check. Favors can also be used to acquire the loan of equipment or documents from influential acquaintances. To call in a favor, you make a favor check. Roll a d20 and add a bonus based on your character level: +1 at 1st-2nd level, +2 at 3rd-6th level, +3 at 7th-11th level, +4 at 12th- 15th level, or +5 at 16th level or higher. The DM sets the DC based on the scope of the favor being requested; it can range from 10 for a simple favor to as high as 25 for highly dangerous, expensive, or illegal favors. You can't take 10 or take 20 on this check, nor can you retry the check for the same (or virtually the same) favor. Favors should help advance the plot of an adventure. A favor that would enable you to circumvent an adventure will always be unavailable to you, regardless of the result of a favor check. You can try to call in a favor a number of times per week equal to one-half your character level, rounded down (minimum one). You can never ask for more than one favor from any one contact in a given week. For instance, at 7th level you can try to call in a favor as many as three times per week, but each attempt must involve a different contact from among those associated with your mercantile house. The DM will carefully monitor your use of favors to ensure that you don't abuse this ability. The success or failure of a mission shouldn't hinge on the use of a favor, and calling in favors shouldn't replace good roleplaying or the use of other skills. The DM may disallow any favor he or she deems disruptive to the campaign.
Flensing Strike			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Exotic Weapon Proficiency (kama), Weapon Focus (kama).														DESC:You have studied a martial style practiced by monks devoted to the Mockery, which has taught you to cut your opponent's skin in a very painful way.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.53	BENEFIT:Using Flensing Strike is a full-round action. Make an attack roll with your kama. If you hit a living, corporeal foe, that creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to taking damage normally. The DC is increased by 2 if you are wielding two kamas (creatures wielding more than two kamas gain no additional bonuses). The target adds his natural armor bonus, if any, as a bonus on this saving throw. A target that fails the saving throw is wracked with pain, receiving a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks for 1 minute. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits, and creatures with a special immunity to pain are not susceptible to this feat. Special: An evil monk may select Flensing Strike as a bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level if she meets the prerequisites.

SOURCEPAGE:p.54	BENEFIT:You gain a greater dragonmark and the use of one spell-like ability associated with the greater dragonmark of your house (see the next section of this chapter for information on dragonmarks). In addition, you can use your least and lesser dragonmark spell-like abilities one additional time per day. A saving throw against one of your dragonmark spelllike abilities has a DC of 10 + the level of the spell + your Cha modifier. Your caster level for your dragonmark spell-like abilities increases to 10 + your level in the dragonmark heir prestige class (if any).

SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:Your action point maximum per level is increased by 3. Thus, you now gain a number of action points equal to 8 + 1/2 your character level at each new level you attain. This number also represents the total number of action points you can have at each level. Normal: Without this feat, player characters receive and are limited to action points equal to 5 + 1/2 their character level at each new level they attain.

Improved Natural Attack		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Natural weapon, base attack bonus +4.																	DESC:One of a creature's natural attacks is more dangerous than its type and size would otherwise indicate.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:Choose one of the creature's natural attack forms. The damage of this natural weapon increases by one step, as if the creature's size had increased by one category. To determine the amount of the increase, find the natural weapon's damage on one of the two progressions given below and improve it to the next higher die value. Progression 1: 1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. Progression 2: 1d10, 2d8, 3d8, 4d8, 6d8, 8d8, 12d8. Special: A creature can gain this feat multiple times.

For a longtooth shifter, the damage his fangs deal increases from 1d6 to 1d8. For a razorclaw shifter, the damage his claws deal increases from 1d4 to 1d6.
Investigate				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																DESC:You can use the Search skill to find and analyze clues at the scene of a crime or a mystery.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:This feat expands the way you can use the Search skill by allowing you to notice and analyze available clues in a specific area. This use of the Search skill is a fullround action. Clues are pieces of evidence that lead to the solution of a mystery. Clues are physical and can be seen, heard, touched, smelled, or tasted. A clue stands out because it's not a normal feature of the area being searched. Examples of clues include a trampled f lowerbed, a broken urn, a pin snapped off in a lock, a torn strip of cloak, a burnt scrap of scroll, or a brooch clutched in a dead man's fist. Add the following task to the list provided in the Player's Handbook description of the Search skill. So, in addition to using Search to find a certain item, notice a secret door, or find a footprint, you have the additional training and experience necessary to find clues of all sorts. Modify the Search DC according to the nature of the scene being examined, as indicated below. (This function of the Search skill doesn't reveal clues when there are no clues to find.) When a successful Search check turns up a clue, you can make a second check to discern patterns, analyze evidence, and draw conclusions about what occurred in a specific area. In other words, the first Search check lets you find something, and the second check allows you to figure out what you've found. You can make a DC 15 Search check to analyze a clue. By examining a body, you might determine whether the victim fought back or provided no struggle at all, or if claws, a weapon, or a spell killed the victim. By looking at a scorch mark on a wall, you might approximate the location of the spellcaster when the spell was cast. The DC for the check is modified by the time that has elapsed since the event occurred and how significant the clue is, as indicated below. All other rules concerning the Search skill otherwise apply. The DM should secretly make the second Search check to analyze a clue. If the check succeeds, the DM provides a truthful, objective analysis of the clue that can help the investigator reach a reasonable and logical conclusion. For example, analyzing a brooch clutched in the hand of a murdered dwarf (a major clue) reveals that it was torn from a blue cloak or tunic (it bears strands of a blue material). It bears the symbol of House Cannith, but the brooch isn't of the quality that a house noble would normally wear. These true and objective facts are now left for the investigator to consider and follow up on. If the check fails, the DM provides analysis of the clue that sounds plausible but is actually flawed in some manner. For example, a flawed analysis of the major clue discussed above would reveal only that the brooch bears the symbol of House Cannith. Even a successful analysis won't reveal the actual authenticity of a clue. False clues planted at a scene could provide truthful and objective data that leads an investigator in the wrong direction. Generally, investigating a scene a second time doesn't add new insight unless another clue is discovered. You can take 10 when making a Search check to find a clue, but you can't take 20. Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in an appropriate Knowledge skill, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find or analyze clues.

Special: A monk can take this feat as his bonus feat at 1st, 2nd, or 6th level.
Music of Growth			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Bardic music class feature, Perform 12 ranks.

Music of Making			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Bardic music class feature, Perform 9 ranks.																DESC:Echoing the music of creation, your own performance enhances any process of creation.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:If you sing or otherwise perform as part of the casting of a conjuration (creation) spell, the duration of the spell is doubled (as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to it, but without increasing the spell's effective level). Spells with an instantaneous duration are not affected. If you perform while using any Craft skill, you gain a +4 sacred bonus on your Craft check. Special: Using this ability counts as one of your daily uses of bardic music.
Powerful Charge			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Medium or larger size, base attack bonus +1.																DESC:You can charge with extra force.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:When you charge, if your melee attack hits, you deal an extra 1d8 points of damage (if you are Medium size). For Large creatures, the extra damage is 2d6; for Huge, 3d6; for Gargantuan, 4d6; and for Colossal, 6d6. This feat only works when you make a charge. It does not work when you are mounted. If you have the ability to make multiple attacks after a charge, you may only apply this extra damage to one of those attacks. Special: A fighter may select Powerful Charge as one of his fighter bonus feats.

Pursue				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Combat Reflexes.																				DESC:You have the ability to follow in an opponent's wake.																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:In combat, when an opponent in an adjacent square takes a single 5-foot step to a square that you do not threaten, you can spend 1 action point to move into the square the opponent just left. This movement occurs after the 5-foot step but before any other actions, and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Raging Luck				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Ability to rage or frenzy.																			DESC:When raging, you have a greater ability to alter your luck than most others do.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:You gain 1 temporary action point while raging.

DESC:You are extremely skilled at spotting impostors.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:You receive a +4 bonus on Spot checks to oppose Disguise checks and on Sense Motive checks to oppose Bluff checks.
Repel Aberration			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Druid level 3rd, Gatekeeper Initiate.																	DESC:Your Gatekeeper training allows you to keep aberrations at bay.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:You can ward off creatures of the aberration type. You make a Charisma check and consult Table 8-9: Turning Undead on page 159 of the Player's Handbook, using your druid level to determine the most powerful aberration you can affect. This ability works only against aberrations within 60 feet of you. You then roll 2d6 and add your druid level + your Cha modifier to determine your turning damage. An affected aberration is held at bay, unable to move toward you for as long as you maintain concentration. The aberration's actions are not otherwise restricted: It can fight other creatures, use its supernatural or spell-like abilities, and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to it, nothing happens. (The creature is not forced back.) The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a warded aberration moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it can't move any closer. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. The Extra Turning feat grants you extra uses of this ability.
Research				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																DESC:You can use your Knowledge skills to extract information from books, scrolls, and other repositories of facts and figures.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	BENEFIT:This feat expands the way you can use the Knowledge skills. It allows you to use a Knowledge skill to navigate a library, an office filing system, a chronicler's repository, or a church's records storage cell in order to discover information. You must be able to read the language the texts are written in to research them. Research a Topic: Given enough time (usually 1d4 hours, though the DM can increase the time based on the amount of material you're examining) and a successful DC 10 skill check, you gain a general understanding of the topic you're researching. This assumes the information you are seeking exists within the collection of materials you are researching. The higher the check result, the better and more detailed the information (to the extent available within the source material). When you want to find out specific information on a specific topic, you must first find a library with tomes relating to that topic. The quality of the library or collection can provide a circumstance bonus on your Knowledge check when performing research. General-purpose libraries (such as those found in some wealthy households, small churches, or towns) contain basic information on a variety of topics and provide a +1 circumstance bonus. A library devoted to a specific topic (usually owned by churches or organizations devoted to specific pursuits) provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks related to its topic. Comprehensive collections are harder to find, but they provide a +4 circumstance bonus. Such collections reside with large churches, in some larger cities, in some organizations and institutions, at Morgrave University, and in major chronicle offices. Even rarer and harder to gain access to are master collections, which provide a +6 circumstance bonus. Master collections are found in a few dragonmarked house enclaves, one or two royal libraries, and in the library at Korranberg. Examine Records: Examining books or records to get a general sense of what's in them takes time, skill, and some luck. Find a stack of ledgers in the alchemist's lab? Discover records in the crime lord's hideout? Locate the files pertaining to taxes collected in the city? To get a general sense of the information contained therein and whether or not you can use it, you must make a research check using the most appropriate Knowledge skill. The DC depends on the complexity of the code or filing system used. Complexity of Code DC Needed Basic 10 1d4 hours Simple 15 1d4+1 hours Moderate 20 1d4+2 hours Complex 30 1d4+4 hours On any successful check, the higher the result, the better and more complete the information you glean. If you start out seeking a specific fact, date, map, or similar bit of information, the DM might increase the DC by as little as +5 or as much as +15. You can retry a Knowledge check made to perform research, though if the material you are examining doesn't contain the data you seek, you can't find it. You can take 10 or take 20 when making a Knowledge check to research a topic or examine records. This use of the Knowledge skill takes a minimum of 1d4 hours.
Right of Counsel			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Elf.																						DESC:You have the legal and sacral right to seek advice from one of your ancestors, a deathless elf in Aerenal's City of the Dead.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	BENEFIT:By virtue of your hereditary place in your family, you are allowed to enter the City of the Dead and seek advice from a deathless ancestor who resides there. Generally, your ancestor is an undying councilor (see page 301). If you physically present yourself before your ancestor, you can gain one of the following benefits. . The ancestor uses one of its spelllike abilities, such as dispel evil, dispel magic, or heal, on your behalf. . The ancestor an swers your questions about matters within its experience and learning, up to the limits of its own knowledge. . The ancestor seeks supernatural knowledge on your behalf, providing answers to questions equivalent to a commune spell with your level as the caster level and no XP cost. The deathless ancestors in the City of the Dead grow impatient with frequent interruption, and thus they refuse to assist you more than once per month. Normal: The elves guard the City of the Dead with religious devotion, preventing anyone from entering who is not entitled to visit the ancestors.
Serpent Strike			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Simple Weapon Proficiency (longspear), Weapon Focus (longspear), flurry of blows class feature.							DESC:Through monastic weapon training, you have mastered a fighting style that makes use of an unusual monk weapon: the longspear.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BENEFIT:You can treat a longspear as a special monk weapon, allowing you to perform a flurry of blows with it.
Shifter Defense			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shifter																																								PRETEXT:Shifter, two other shifter feats.																		DESC:By delving into your shifter heritage, you have developed the ability to ignore a little damage from every attack.

DESC:You are a tenacious combatant, continuing to fight when others would succumb to pain and injury.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BENEFIT:While shifting, you continue to fight without penalty if you are disabled or dying.

DESC:You are adept at using your natural attack in conjunction with another weapon.

DESC:You wield the power of the Silver Flame to smite evil.																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BENEFIT:When you use your smite evil ability, you deal an extra 1d6 points of sacred damage to the opponent you smite. The fire is silvery in appearance but does not burn.
Song of the Heart			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Bardic music class feature, inspire competence ability, Perform 6 ranks.											DESC:Your bardic music reaches the depths of its listeners' hearts.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BENEFIT:When you use inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics, any bonus granted by your music increases by +1. Thus, a 15th-level bard with this feat grants his allies a +4 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear when he uses inspire courage, rather than the +3 he would normally grant. If he uses inspire greatness, the same bard grants up to three allies 3 bonus Hit Dice, a +3 bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves. Also, when you use fascinate, suggestion, or mass suggestion, the saving throw DC increases by 1. If you have the Haunting Melody feat, the saving throw DC for that effect also increases by 1. If you have the Music of Growth feat, the bonus bestowed by that feat increases to +6. If you have the Music of Making feat, the bonus on Craft checks bestowed by that feat increases to +6. If you have the Soothe the Beast feat, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Perform check to improve the attitude of an animal or magical beast.
Soothe The Beast			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Bardic music class feature, Perform 6 ranks.																DESC:Echoing the music of creation, your music has power to calm animals.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.60	BENEFIT:You gain an ability similar to the wild empathy ability of a druid or ranger. Your music can improve the attitude of an animal. You make a Perform check instead of a Diplomacy check and use the result to determine the animal's new attitude. The typical domesticated animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use this ability, you must be within 30 feet of the animal. The check takes 1 minute, but it might take longer to actually influence the animal. You can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you take a -4 penalty on the check. Special: Using this ability counts as one of your daily uses of bardic music.
Spontaneous Casting		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Caster level 5th.																				DESC:You can swap a prepared spell on the fly.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.61	BENEFIT:You can exchange a spell you have prepared for another spell on your spell list (or for wizards, out of your spellbook) of the same level. Special: Using this ability costs 2 action points.
Strong Mind				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Wisdom 11.																					DESC:You are unusually hard to affect with psionic powers and mind attacks.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.61	BENEFIT:You gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against psionic abilities and mind attacks. Psionic abilities include many spell-like abilities of monsters such as aboleths, mind flayers, and yuan-ti (and any other creatures whose special attacks are described as psionic). Mind attacks include the mind flayer's mind blast ability, as well as any similar supernatural ability that uses sheer mental force to stun or disable an opponent (at the DM's discretion). Special: The benefit of this feat does not extend to spells, spell-like abilities, or magic items that duplicate psionic abilities. This is an exception to the general rule that magic and psionics are equivalent.
Totem Companion			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Wild empathy class feature, Beast Totem, ability to acquire a new animal companion, minimum level requirement (see below).			DESC:Instead of an animal companion, you have your totem magical beast as a companion.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.61	BENEFIT:When choosing an animal companion, you may choose a magical beast of the same kind as your beast totem. Even though your companion is a magical beast, you can cast spells on it that normally target animals as though it were an animal. Apply the indicated adjustment to the character's level (in parentheses) to determine the companion's special powers (see Alternative Animal Companions, page 36 of the Player's Handbook). Rangers who choose this feat use one-half their level to determine what companions they may attract. The totem companion has all the normal abilities of a typical creature of its kind, as well as the characteristics of an animal companion determined by your druid or ranger level.
Undead Empathy			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Charisma 13.																					DESC:You are adept at communicating with and influencing the undead.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.61	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks made to influence the reactions of intelligent undead. You can also use Diplomacy to influence the actions of mindless undead, though in this case you do not gain the +4 bonus on your check. Generally, mindless undead begin an encounter with a hostile attitude; a Diplomacy check sufficient to make them indifferent is usually enough to stave off attack. If the undead have been specifically commanded to guard something, a Diplomacy check sufficient to make them friendly is required to make them back off from combat, and a check sufficient to make them helpful is needed to make them abandon what they are guarding. To influence the behavior of a mindless undead, the character and the undead must be within 30 feet of one another. Generally, influencing an undead in this way takes 1 minute, but as with influencing the living, it might take more or less time.
Urban Tracking			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																DESC:You can track the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.61	BENEFIT:To find the trail of an individual or to follow it for 1 hour requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour of the search, as well as each time the trail becomes difficult to follow, such as when it moves to a different area of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on the community size and the conditions. If you fail a Gather Information check, you can retry it after 1 hour of questioning. The DM should secretly roll the number of checks required, so that the player doesn't know exactly how long the task will take. Normal: A character without this feat can use Gather Information to find out information about a particular individual, but each check takes 1d4+1 hours and doesn't allow effective trailing. Special: A character with 5 ranks in Knowledge (local) gains a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks when using this feat. You can cut the time per Gather Information check in half (to 30 minutes per check rather than 1 hour), but you take a -5 penalty to the check.
Vermin Companion			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Druid level 3rd, nongood alignment, Child of Winter, ability to acquire a new animal companion, minimum level requirement (see below).	DESC:Instead of an animal companion, you have a vermin creature as a companion.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:When choosing an animal companion, you may choose a vermin instead. Even though your companion is a vermin, you can cast spells on it that normally target animals as though it were an animal. Your companion gains an Intelligence score of 1 but does not gain any skills or feats. Apply the indicated adjustment to the character's level (in parentheses) to determine the companion's special powers (see Alternative Animal Companions, page 36 of the Player's Handbook). A vermin companion has all the normal abilities of a typical creature of its kind, as well as the characteristics of an animal companion determined by your druid level.
Vermin Shape			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Druid level 5th, nongood alignment, Child of Winter.														DESC:You can use your wild shape ability to assume vermin forms instead of animal forms.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:You can turn yourself into a Small or Medium vermin. You gain the ability to take the shape of a Large vermin when your druid level reaches 8th, a Tiny vermin at 11th level, and a Huge vermin at 15th level. In no case can the vermin form's Hit Dice exceed your druid level. Special: You can't use wild shape to turn yourself into an animal if you have this feat.
Wand Mastery			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Craft Wand, caster level 9th.																		DESC:Wands are far more potent in your hands.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:When you use a wand, the DC of saving throws against the wand's effect is increased by 2 and the wand's effective caster level is increased by 2.
Warden Initiate			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																								PRETEXT:Ability to spontaneously cast summon nature's ally.															DESC:You have been trained in the ancient druidic tradition of the Wardens of the Wood, a sect dedicated to protecting the eastern plain and the great woods of the Eldeen Reaches.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class when fighting within a forest. Add Climb and Jump to your list of druid class skills. In addition, you can cast the following spells as if they were on the druid spell list at the indicated level. 1st level: protection from evil 2nd level: detect thoughts 3rd level: displacement 4th level: locate creature 5th level: hold monster 6th level: repulsion 7th level: banishment 8th level: screen 9th level: hold monster, mass

DESC:Through monastic weapon training, you have mastered a fighting style that makes use of an unusual monk weapon: the longsword.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:You can treat a longsword as a special monk weapon, allowing you to perform a flurry of blows with it.
