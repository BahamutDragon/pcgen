For instance, if your Charisma is 17 (+3 bonus), you ignore 6 points of your target's damage reduction when making a demolishing smite. &nl;Overwhelming Smite: Your smite attack can knock an opponent prone.

Touch Of Healing		TYPE:Reserve	CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:You can channel divine energy into healing with a touch.		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to cast 2nd-level spells.	BENEFIT:As long as you have a conjuration (healing) spell of 2nd level or higher available to cast, you can spend a standard action to touch a target creature and heal 3 points of damage per level of the highest-level conjuration (healing) spell you have available to cast. You can use this ability only on a target that has been reduced to one-half or fewer of its total hit points. The effect ends once you've healed the subject up to half its normal maximum hit points. This ability has no effect on creatures that can't be healed by cure spells. As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting conjuration (healing) spells.
Travel Devotion		TYPE:Domain		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:You can move quickly around the battlefield.	BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can activate this ability to move up to your speed as a swift action each round. Thus, you can move your speed and then take a full-round action, or move and take two other actions (two move actions or one move action and one standard action).

Trickery Devotion		TYPE:Domain		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:You project a simulacrum of yourself that can perform limited tasks.	BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action, you can create an exact duplicate of yourself up to 30 feet away. You can control this simulacrum's movements as a free action. The image becomes more "real" as you advance in level. This ability is usable up to a maximum of 1 minute per level each day. The simulacrum combines the characteristics of the silent image (PH 279) and unseen servant (PH 297) spells. Its hit points are equal to 6 + your character level. It ignores terrain effects and moves like an unseen servant, making no noise in the process, though it makes normal motions while traveling. If you have a fly speed, the image appears to fly when not in contact with the ground; otherwise, it walks on open air. You can do anything with this image that you could do with the unseen servant spell and are under the same limitations. When you attain 5th level, you gain more control over the simulacrum. At this point, it behaves more like a major image spell (PH 252), though it still performs actions like an unseen servant. As long as the simulacrum remains within 5 feet of your position (and you can direct it to do so as a free action), you can perform a Bluff check in combat as a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on this check, which is opposed by your opponents' Sense Motive checks. If you are successful, your foes believe the image is you (and vice versa) for 1 round. Once you reach 10th level, you can spend a swift action to transfer your perceptions to the simulacrum and perceive the world from its point of view rather than your own. You can move the image as if it were your own body, using the simulacrum's movement characteristics (ignoring terrain, "flying, " and the like). You can also perform any skill and ability checks using the simulacrum, as long as they do not require a Strength score higher than 2. The image has phantom versions of all your equipment (such as lockpicks), but any such items that lose direct contact with it immediately dissipate. When you attain 15th level, the image can become more "real" at your command. It gains a Strength score equal to one-half your own and can perform combat actions using phantom versions of your gear. Any of these items that lose contact with the image dissipate immediately. Thus, the image can wield a sword, but if it shoots a bow, the arrow disappears as soon as it is fired. Equipment that extends more than 5 feet from the image (such as a length of rope) also disappears beyond that distance. In addition, you can now cast spells originating from the image as if with a project image spell (PH 265), with one exception. If you lose line of effect to the image, the effect does not end; you just can't cast spells originating from the image until you gain line of effect again. &nl;Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. &nl;Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.

Umbral Shroud		TYPE:Reserve	CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:You control darkness and shadows.		PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.	BENEFIT:As long as you have a 3rd-level or higher darkness spell available to cast, shadows and darkness appear to obey your will. As a standard action, you can direct these shadows to obscure the vision of one foe within 30 feet. If your target fails a Will save, its attacks have a miss chance equal to 5%% per level of the highest-level darkness spell you have available to cast. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next action. &nl;Creatures that do not rely on sight are unaffected by this effect, and those with Blind-Fight or similar abilities can fight as they normally would. &nl;As a secondary benefit, you gain darkvision out to 10 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 10 feet.
Venom's Gift		TYPE:Wild		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:You can imbue your natural attacks with a touch of venom.		PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Any two wild feats, wild shape class feature, ability to assume plant form using wild shape.	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can expend one daily use of your wild shape ability to envenom your natural attacks for up to 1 round per caster level you possess. An ordinary unarmed strike does not qualify for this benefit; you must have a true natural attack, though it can be the result of a transmutation spell or other shapechange effect. &nl;Poison: Injury, Fortitude negates (DC 10 +1/2 your HD + your Con modifier), ld2 Str/ld2 Str.
War Devotion		TYPE:Domain		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:You can control your abilities more effectively in combat.	BENEFIT:Once per day, when fighting defensively as a standard or full-round action, you take a -3 penalty on all attack rolls in a round and gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC in the same round. When you attain 7th level, your penalty on attack rolls drops to -2 and your dodge bonus increases to +4.

Water Devotion		TYPE:Domain		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:You can create a water guardian.	BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action, you can pour the contents of a full waterskin on the ground and summon forth a water elemental on that spot. The creature remains and follows your commands for 1 minute. The size of the elemental is based on your character level, as given in the table below. &nl;Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. &nl;Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
