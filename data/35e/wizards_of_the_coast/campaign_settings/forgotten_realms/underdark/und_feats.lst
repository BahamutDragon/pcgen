Axeshield				SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:General.Fighter	CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You know how to defend yourself with a battleaxe.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Grimlock.	BENEFIT:When you wield a battleaxe, you can deflect some blows that would otherwise strike you. In any combat round during which you make a full attack while wielding a battleaxe, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class that lasts until your next action. Special: A fighter may select Axeshield as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Bowslinger				SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:General.Fighter	CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can ready ranged weapons surprisingly quickly.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll when you fire or throw a ranged weapon at a flat-footed opponent. Special: A fighter may select Bowslinger as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Caustic Adaptation		SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:Long have your ancestors hunted and been hunted in the depths. Natural selection has given your blood an unpalatable, acidic quality.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Kuo-toa.	BENEFIT:A creature that makes a successful bite attack against you takes 1d4 points of acid damage. Creatures immune to poison are not affected.
Caver					SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:The Underdark’s cave systems stretch for thousands of miles below the surface. You are knowledgeable about the secrets of the subterranean world and wise in its ways.	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks and Survival checks made in the Underdark.
Elfhunter				SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:Because of your cultural hatred for elves, you have had specific training in how best to fight them.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Drow.	BENEFIT:Choose one subrace of elf. When fighting elves of this kind, you gain a +1 competence bonus on melee damage rolls and on ranged attack rolls made at ranges of up to 30 feet. You also gain the benefit of the Improved Critical feat for the weapon you are using in any such attack. This benefit does not stack with that of the Improved Critical feat. Special: You may take this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat you must choose a new subrace of elf to which it will apply.
Enhanced Adhesive			SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:The natural adhesive you secrete becomes stickier.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Kuo-toa.	BENEFIT:When your shield is coated with your natural adhesive, it is more difficult than usual for an opponent to avoid becoming stuck to it and to break free once stuck. The DC for the opponent’s Reflex save to avoid getting stuck after an unsuccessful melee attack increases by +2. The DC for the opponent’s Strength check to free itself or its weapon after becoming stuck increases by the same amount. Normal: The DC for the Reflex save is 11 + your Constitution modifier. The only way to increase the DC is to increase your Constitution modifier. The DC for the Strength check is normally a flat value that cannot be increased.
Exotic Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:Choose a type of exotic armor, such as feeler plate or spidersilk (see Chapter 5: Equipment and Magic Items for a list of exotic armor types). You understand how to wear that type of exotic armor properly.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Armor Proficiency of the appropriate sort (for example, you must have Armor Proficiency [Heavy] to take Exotic Armor Proficiency [feeler plate]).	BENEFIT:You are proficient with a specific type of exotic armor and take no armor nonproficiency penalties when you wear it. Normal: If you are wearing exotic armor with which you are not proficient, you take its armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and Dexterity-based skill checks. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you must choose a new type of exotic armor.
Extra Wild Shape			SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:Wild			CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can use wild shape more frequently than you normally could.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to use wild shape.	BENEFIT:You may use your wild shape ability two more times per day than you otherwise could. If you are able to use wild shape to become an elemental, you also gain one additional use per day of your elemental wild shape. Special: You can take this feat multiple times, gaining two additional wild shapes of your usual type and one additional elemental wild shape (if you have this capability) each time.
Familiar Spell			SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You are so well acquainted with the spells you have mastered that you can store the prepared spells in the mind of your familiar.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to acquire a familiar, Spell Mastery.	BENEFIT:You may prepare one spell of any level that you have mastered with the Spell Mastery feat in your familiar’s mind instead of your own, treating the extra preparation as if you had one extra spell slot per day, which can be used only for a mastered spell. You can cast this spell normally as long as your familiar is within one square of you. Once cast, the spell is used up, just as if you had held it in your own mind. Your familiar cannot cast this spell itself, even if it is a creature that normally has spellcasting ability. Special: You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, your familiar’s mind can hold one additional prepared mastered spell per day.
Graft Illithid Flesh		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:ItemCreation		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can apply illithid grafts to other living creatures or to yourself. (See Illithid Grafts in Chapter 5: Equipment and Magic Items.)	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Illithid, Heal (10 ranks).	BENEFIT:You can create illithid grafts and apply them to other living creatures or to yourself. Creating a graft takes one day for each 1,000 gp of its price. To create a graft, you must spend 1/25 of the graft’s price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this price.
Highborn Drow			SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You have learned how to tap into the advanced magical abilities available to you through your drow noble heritage.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Drow, base Will save +2.	BENEFIT:You may use detect good, detect magic, and levitate once per day as spell-like abilities, with a caster level equal to your character level.
Improved Levitation		SOURCEPAGE:p.25	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You have learned to use only part of your levitate spell-like ability at a time, allowing multiple uses with shorter durations.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Levitate as a spell-like ability.	BENEFIT:You may use your levitate spell-like ability in 10- minute increments instead of using the entire duration at once. The number of times per day that you may use levitate at the shorter duration is equal to your caster level. If you could levitate more than once per day before taking this feat, multiply your caster level by the number of times per day you could levitate before to get the total number of shorter uses of levitate that you have available per day.
Lolth’s Meat			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:Like all drow raised in cities that are ruled by Lolth’s priestesses, you know that you exist only to provide your goddess with food and pleasure. This knowledge lends you a certain bloodthirsty readiness.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Drow.	BENEFIT:If you kill a living creature that has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher with a melee attack, you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for the rest of the encounter. If you kill such an opponent either by performing a coup de grace or with a touch spell, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for the rest of the encounter. To qualify for this bonus, you must either reduce the target to –10 hp with your blow or kill it with a touch spell (such as slay living).
Metanode Spell			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:Metamagic		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC: You cast metamagic spells to greater effect in earth nodes than elsewhere (see Node Magic in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells).	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.	BENEFIT:When casting a spell improved by a metamagic feat, you can deduct the class of the earth node layer in which you currently stand from the increased spell level. (The class of the layer does not equal the class of the node unless you are standing in the innermost portion of it.) For example, if you use Maximize Spell to augment the 3rdlevel spell fireball in the innermost (+1) layer of a Class 1 earth node, you cast the spell as if it were only two levels higher than normal, not three, because the earth node pays one spell level’s worth of the metamagic cost. This feat is most useful to casters who do not prepare their spells (such as bards and sorcerers) and to wizards who rarely leave their earth nodes and can therefore prepare and cast their spells at the adjusted level. If you use this feat to reduce the cost of preparing a metamagic spell and then leave the earth node, the spell you prepared becomes unavailable until you return to an earth node layer of at least the same class as the one in which the spell was prepared.
Node Defense			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can use the magical power of an earth node to defend yourself from harm.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.	BENEFIT:You receive an insight bonus to your Armor Class and saving throws equal to the class of any earth node layer you currently occupy, up to a maximum of +4. For example, if you are inside the middle (+2) layer of a Class 3 earth node, you gain a +2 insight bonus to your AC and saves.
Node Sensitive			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can perceive an earth node just by passing near it.	BENEFIT:You automatically note the presence of any earth node within 30 feet. Normal: A creature without this feat that comes within 30 feet of the outermost layer of an earth node can make a DC 20 Intelligence check to note the presence of an earth node. A creature with the Node Spellcasting feat can attempt either an Intelligence check or a Spellcraft check at the same DC to notice the node.
Node Spellcasting			SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You have discovered the secret of node magic (see Node Magic in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells).	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 1st.	BENEFIT:You may take full advantage of earth nodes and node magic, as described in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells. This feat grants you access to the various node magic feats and allows you to make a Spellcraft check instead of an Intelligence check to notice nearby nodes and manipulate various node powers. Normal: A creature without this feat cannot take other noderelated feats, cannot access an earth node’s full potential, and must make an Intelligence check to notice nearby nodes or to manipulate node powers.
Node Store				SOURCEPAGE:p.26	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can store a prepared spell in an earth node (see Node Magic in Chapter 4: Magic and Spells).	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.	BENEFIT:Each time you take this feat, choose two spells of any level that you know and can cast. If you are a spellcaster who prepares spells, you may now prepare those two spells in addition to your normal spell complement as long as you are in an earth node, just as if you had two extra spell slots per day. These extra prepared spells are stored in the earth node instead of in your mind. You can cast them normally while you are within that earth node, even if you have left it and returned since storing them there. If you are a spellcaster who does not prepare spells, choose two spells that you know. You may now cast those two spells while in that earth node as if you had two extra spell slots per day available. Each such slot can be used only to cast its designated spell; it cannot be used for any other spell (including the other spell designated with this feat). If you leave the node, these extra spell slots become unavailable to you, but you can use them again if you return, provided that you haven’t already used them since the last time you rested. You do not need to designate a specific node in which to store your spells when you choose this feat, but you can have spells stored in only one earth node at a time. You can change the earth node in which your spells are stored by meditating for 1 hour inside the new node you have selected. Special: You may gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to two new spells.
Portal Sensitive			SOURCEPAGE:p.27	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can perceive a portal just by passing near it.	PRETEXT:	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Deep Imaskar or gloaming.	BENEFIT:You can detect an active or inactive portal as if it were a normal secret door (Search DC 20). If you merely pass within 5 feet of a portal, you are entitled to a Search check to notice it as if you were actively looking for it. You also gain a +2 bonus on your caster level check when trying to discern portal properties with the analyze portal spell. Normal: Portals can be found only by using analyze portal, detect magic, or the granted power from the Portal domain.
Stone Soul				SOURCEPAGE:p.27	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You were born with a dwarflike, innate sense about rock, stone, and construction.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Deep Imaskar or slyth.	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on Search checks made to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. A construction that isn’t stone but is disguised to look like stone also counts as unusual stonework. A character with the Stone Soul feat who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a check as if actively searching. Special: You may take this feat only as a 1st-level character.
Strong Mind				SOURCEPAGE:p.27	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You are unusually difficult to affect with psionic powers and mind attacks.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Wis 11.	BENEFIT:You gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against psionic abilities and mind blast attacks. Psionic abilities include the spelllike abilities of monsters such as aboleths, mind flayers, yuan-ti, and any other creatures whose special attacks are described as psionics. Mind blast attacks include the mind flayer’s mind blast ability, as well as any similar supernatural ability (at the DM’s discretion) that uses sheer mental force to stun or disable an opponent.
Tunnelfighter			SOURCEPAGE:p.27	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can fight more naturally in the cramped and close quarters of caves and tunnels than usual.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dex 13 or Tunnelrunner.	BENEFIT:You ignore the penalty for hampered melee when fighting in a narrow space (an area smaller than but at least onehalf of your space) or a low space (an area shorter than but at least one-half of your height) with light or one-handed melee weapons. Furthermore, you take only a –4 circumstance penalty when using a two-handed weapon in such conditions. In a space both narrow and low, you function as if only one of those conditions applied (see Chapter 7: Exploring the Underdark for rules on fighting and moving in cramped spaces). In addition, when fighting in cramped quarters, you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Normal: In a narrow or low space, a creature without this feat takes a –2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls with light weapons and a –4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls with onehanded weapons. It cannot use two-handed weapons at all. Such a creature also loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. In a space that is both narrow and low, the penalties are doubled.
Tunnelrunner			SOURCEPAGE:p.27	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:You can move naturally in the cramped quarters of caves and tunnels.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Chitine or grimlock.	BENEFIT:You ignore the speed reduction for hampered movement when moving in a narrow space (an area smaller than but at least one-half of your space) or a low space (an area shorter than but at least one-half of your height). You also retain your Dexterity bonus to your Armor Class. If the space is both narrow and low, you function as if only one of those conditions applied. Normal: In a narrow or low space, a creature without this feat is reduced to one-half normal speed and loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. In a space that is both narrow and low, speed is reduced to one-quarter normal.
Wisdom Breeds Caution		SOURCEPAGE:p.27	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT		DESC:Not getting into a dangerous situation is generally the wisest course, but if danger is unavoidable, you’re prepared. You rely more on caution and forethought than you do on physical prowess.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Slyth or svirfneblin.	BENEFIT:At 1st level, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Constitution modifier to determine bonus hit points. At each level thereafter, you use your Constitution modifier normally to determine bonus hit points, but you also gain +1 hit point for every point of permanent Wisdom you gain. Normal: Your Constitution modifier determines your bonus hit points at every character level. Special: You may take this feat only as a 1st-level character.
