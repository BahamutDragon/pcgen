He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, or the like). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arachnomancer, the player must decide to which class to add each arachnomancer level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level.
Poison Save Bonus			KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Poison Save Bonus				SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:An arachnomancer adds his class level to all saves against poison.

Mindless creatures can communicate and understand only extremely simple concepts (one word at best), but they generally don't try to eat someone who communicates with them.
Spider Magic			KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Spider Magic					SOURCEPAGE:p.29	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Add the following spells to the character's spell list (or to each spell list, if he has more than one): 0 stick4; 1st summon Small monstrous spider1; 2ndspiderskin4, summon Medium monstrous spider1; 3rdneutralize poison, poison, summon Large monstrous spider1; 4thgiant vermin (spiders only), repel vermin, summon Huge monstrous spider1; 5th spider plague2; 6thsummon Gargantuan monstrous spider1; 7thspider shapes3; 8thsummon Colossal monstrous spider1; 9thshapechange (into spider or spiderkind creature only; see sidebar on page 30). Spider magic spells are added to the character's class lists of available spells, so that he may choose them whenever he has the opportunity to acquire new spells of the appropriate level. He does not automatically learn them (in the case of a spellcaster who keeps spellbooks) or know them (in the case of a spellcaster who does not keep spellbooks).
Spiderform				KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Spiderform					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, an arachnomancer may transform himself into a Small, Medium, or Large monstrous spider three times per day. At 5th level, he can also take the form of a Tiny or Huge monstrous spider, and at 8th level, he can take the form of a Gargantuan monstrous spider. This ability functions like polymorph, except that the indicated forms are the only ones available and the duration of the change is up to 10 minutes per arachnomancer level. Resuming normal form requires a standard action but does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Poison Touch			KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Poison Touch					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:The arachnomancer can secrete poison as a free action. When he first gains this ability at 3rd level, his touch deals 1d4 points of Strength damage. The damage increases to 1d6 points at 6th level and to 1d8 points at 9th level. In each case, a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + arachnomancer level + arachnomancer's Con modifier) halves the damage, to a minimum of 1 point. The arachnomancer's poison cannot be harvested or saved for any purpose.
Command Spiders			KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Command Spiders					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 4th level, an arachnomancer gains the ability to compel any spider or spiderkind creature (see sidebar) in the same way that an evil cleric can rebuke or command undead. The arachnomancer can attempt to command spiders a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He is treated as a cleric of a level equal to his character level (not arachnomancer level) for the purpose of turning checks and turning damage.
Webwalking				KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Webwalking					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Beginning at 5th level, an arachnomancer can ignore webs (magical or nonmagical) as if affected by a freedom of movement spell. He can climb webs at his normal land speed without needing to make a Climb check and walk along webs without needing to make a Balance check.
Wall of Webs			KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Wall of Webs					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:At 7th level, an arachnomancer gains the ability to create a wall-like barrier of webs once per day. Unlike the webs produced by the web spell, those in the wall of webs are resistant to fire and as tough as steel. A wall of webs functions like the wall of iron spell (caster level equals arachnomancer level), except that an arachnomancer can use his webwalking ability to move through the wall unhindered, and any other creature can use freedom of movement to do the same.
Spider Blast			KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Spider Blast					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:Once per day, a 10th-level arachnomancer can produce a 50-footlong, cone-shaped blast of extremely poisonous, normalsized spiders. Every creature within the area of the blast takes 5d4 points of damage and must make 1d4 Fortitude saves against poison (DC 10 + arachnomancer level + arachnomancer's Con modifier; 1d6 points of Strength damage for both initial and secondary damage). Each creature is also allowed a Reflex save at the same DC for partial effect: Success means the victim takes half damage and need make only one Fortitude saving throw against poison (though the second saving throw normally required against a poison's secondary effect still applies). The spiders fade away at the end of the arachnomancer's turn.

# Cavelord
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Cavelord ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Cavelords are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with all types of shields except tower shields.

Cave Tracker			KEY:Cavelord ~ Cave Tracker						SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a cavelord can move at normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty on the Survival check, as long as those tracks are confined to a cave or tunnel environment.
Lesser Cavesense			KEY:Cavelord ~ Lesser Cavesense					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Gifted with a mystical connection to the Underdark, the cavelord gains a superior form of darkvision with a 120-foot range when he reaches 2nd level. He also gains a +4 competence bonus on any Listen checks made in a subterranean setting.
Tunnelswimmer			KEY:Cavelord ~ Tunnelswimmer						SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:A cavelord is at home in the subterranean waters that pervade the Underdark. Upon reaching 4th level, he can hold his breath three times longer than normal before he is at risk of drowning (a number of rounds equal to six times his Constitution score for a typical humanoid character). The cavelord also gains a swim speed of 30 feet.
Strength of Stones		KEY:Cavelord ~ Strength of Stones					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 5th level, a cavelord gains the ability to invoke the strength of the earth. Once per day as a free action, he can gain an insight bonus to Strength equal to his cavelord level that lasts for 1 minute.
Greater Cavesense			KEY:Cavelord ~ Greater Cavesense					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:When a cavelord reaches 7th level, his mystical connection to the Underdark increases, granting him the tremorsense ability (see Chapter 7 of the Monster Manual) with a 30-foot range.
Changestones			KEY:Cavelord ~ Changestones						SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:At 8th level, a cavelord gains the ability to use changestones (see Chapter 4:Magic and Spells) once per day (caster level 14th).
Bones of the Earth		KEY:Cavelord ~ Bones of the Earth					SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavelord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:When a cavelord reaches 10th level, the earth recognizes him as its own and protects him from death. If the cavelord takes damage that would reduce him to -10 or fewer hit points while in a cave, tunnel, or other Underdark environment, he may attempt a Fortitude save (DC 5 + damage dealt). If the save is successful, the cavelord instantly turns to stone, as if subject to the flesh to stone spell, before death can claim him. (This ability also works if unstaunched bleeding would cause the cavelord's hit points to drop to -10 or below. The DC for the Fortitude save in this case is 6.) His stone form becomes fixed in place as if it were a natural feature of the cavern. Twenty-four hours later, the earth looses its healing grip, and the cavelord becomes flesh again. He awakens with 1 hit point and no prepared spells or power points. Any significant damage done to his stony form (such as breaking off the head, or shattering the body) kills the cavelord.

# Deep Diviner
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Deep diviners gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day			KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Spells per Day					SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At each deep diviner level except 6th, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and the like). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a deep diviner, the player must decide to which class to add each deep diviner level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level.
Locate Node				KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Locate Node					SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 1st level, a deep diviner gains the ability to sense the direction and strength of the nearest earth node, regardless of distance (see Node Magic in Chapter 4). To locate the node, she must meditate for 10 minutes. She can use this ability once per day per deep diviner level, so a 3rd-level deep diviner could make three attempts to locate the nearest node in a single day. The deep diviner's ability to sense earth nodes is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead, and by certain rare ores in the earth of the DM's choice.
Node Spellcasting			KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Node Spellcasting				SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 1st level, a deep diviner gains Node Spellcasting as a bonus feat (see Chapter 2:Regions and Feats).
Speak To Stone			KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Speak To Stone					SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:When a deep diviner reaches 2nd level, her presence can lend nearby rock and earth a fleeting awareness. This ability can be used once per day, and the sentience lasts for 1 minute per caster level of the deep diviner. During this period, the character can comprehend and communicate with stone and earth, including normally nonanimate rock, worked stone, and dirt. She can pose questions to and receive answers from a pebble, a section of tunnel wall, or a pile of loose earth. A stone normally has no sense of its surroundings, but the deep diviner's presence allows it to recall a very limited amount of information. As with the stone tell spell, speaking stones may relate who or what has touched them and give complete descriptions of what is covered or concealed behind or under them.
Node Store				KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Node Store						SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 3rd level, a deep diviner gains Node Store as a bonus feat (see Chapter 2:Regions and Feats).
Summon Earth Elemental		KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Summon Earth Elemental				SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:Once per day at 5th level and above, the deep diviner can summon a Large earth elemental as though with the summon monster VI spell (caster level 12th).
Node Charge				KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Node Charge					SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 6th level, a deep diviner can tap the power of an earth node even from a distance. If she spends at least 4 hours in an earth node, she can leave with her connection to it intact. At any time during the next ten days while she is outside the keyed earth node, she can activate that connection for 1 minute as a free action. Once connected, the deep diviner can use all abilities granted to her by that earth node as if she were still within it. After using this ability, the deep diviner must return to an earth node and spend at least 4 hours within its confines (see Node Magic in Chapter 4:Magic and Spells) before she can tap its power remotely again.
Metanode Spell			KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Metanode Spell					SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 8th level, a deep diviner gains Metanode Spell as a bonus feat (see Chapter 2:Regions and Feats).
Wall of Stone			KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Wall of Stone					SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:Upon reaching 9th level, a deep diviner gains the ability to use wall of stone (caster level 16th) once per day.
Mantle of Earth			KEY:Deep Diviner ~ Mantle of Earth					SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deep Diviner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 10th level, a deep diviner can become a greater earth elemental (see the Monster Manual) once per day for up to 10 minutes. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except that the deep diviner gains all the elemental's extraordinary abilities and supernatural abilities. She also gains access to all the elemental's feats for as long as she remains in that form. Changing form is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

# Drow Judicator
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Drow judicators are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with all types of shields except tower shields.
Spells per Day			KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Spells per Day					SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At every third drow judicator level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level (for male drow, this is usually an arcane spellcasting class, although male clerics of Selvetarm sometimes become drow judicators). He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and the like). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a drow judicator, the player must decide to which class to add each drow judicator level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level.
War Strike				KEY:Drow Judicator ~ War Strike					SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:War is the ultimate expression of Selvetarm's power, so its lessons are the very first that the drow judicator learns. Beginning at 1st level, he can attempt a war strike with one normal melee attack. If he hits, he deals 2d6 points of Constitution damage in addition to his regular damage. The target may attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + drow judicator level + drow judicator's Cha modifier) to halve the Constitution damage. This ability is usable once per day.
Command Spiders			KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Command Spiders				SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:As a special dispensation from Lolth, Selvatarm can grant his judicators the ability to command spiders. When a drow judicator reaches 2nd level, he gains the ability to compel spiders in the same way that an evil cleric can rebuke or command undead (see the Player's Handbook). The drow judicator can attempt to command spiders a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He is treated as a cleric of a level equal to his drow judicator level for the purpose of turning checks and turning damage.
Selvetarm's Blessing		KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Selvetarm's Blessing				SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 2nd level and above, a drow judicator receives a +3 profane bonus on all saving throws.
Selvetarm's Wrath			KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Selvetarm's Wrath				SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a drow judicator may attempt to deliver extra damage with one normal melee attack. On a successful attack, he deals 1 extra point of damage per drow judicator level. For example, an 8th-level drow judicator armed with a longsword deals 1d8+8 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses (for high Strength, magical effects, or the like) that would normally apply. This ability is usable once per day at 4th level, twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 10th level.
Spider Servant			KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Spider Servant					SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 5th level, a drow judicator can call for a spider servant.

Spider's Grace			KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Spider's Grace					SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:At 8th level, a drow judicator gains the ability to take on attributes of a spider for up to 10 minutes once per day. While this ability is active, the character can climb on surfaces as if subjected to a spider climb spell, and he receives a +4 insight bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. He also gains a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage and is poisonous. The bite is a secondary natural weapon that can be used once per round at the drow judicator's highest base attack bonus, with the standard -5 penalty for a secondary attack. The Fortitude save DC for the poison is 18 + the drow judicator's Con modifier, and it deals 1d6 points of Strength damage for both its initial and its secondary damage.
Judgment				KEY:Drow Judicator ~ Judgment						SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Drow Judicator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 10th level, a drow judicator gains the ability to judge all creatures within 100 feet of him that he can see. Those he finds wanting are immediately targeted with a horrid wilting effect (caster level 18th; save DC 18 + drow judicator's Wis modifier). The drow judicator can base his decision on any parameters he chooses. This ability is usable once per day as a standard action.

# Spider Servant
Improved Evasion			KEY:Spider Servant ~ Improved Evasion				SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Companion Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a servant takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.
Share Saving Throws		KEY:Spider Servant ~ Share Saving Throws				SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Companion Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:For each of its saving throws, the servant uses its own base save bonus or the drow judicator's, whichever is higher. The servant applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any other bonuses on saves that the drow judicator might have (such as from magic items or feats).
Share Spells			KEY:Spider Servant ~ Share Spells					SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Companion Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At the drow judicator's option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts upon himself also affect his spider servant. The servant must be within 5 feet of him at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the spider servant if the latter moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the creature again even if it returns to the drow judicator before the duration expires. Additionally, the drow judicator may cast a spell with a target of "You" on his spider servant (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. The drow judicator and his servant can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the servant's type.
Speak with Drow Judicator	KEY:Spider Servant ~ Speak with Drow Judicator			SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Companion Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:The drow judicator and his servant can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.
Blood Bond				KEY:Spider Servant ~ Blood Bond					SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Companion Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:The spider servant gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, checks, and saves if it witnesses the drow judicator threatened or harmed. This bonus lasts as long as the threat is immediate and apparent.
Spell Resistance			KEY:Spider Servant ~ Spell Resistance				SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Companion Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:The spider servant's spell resistance equals the drow judicator's class level + 15.

# Illithid Body Tamer
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Illithid body tamers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with all types of shields except tower shields.
Code of Mental Abstinence	KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Code of Mental Abstinence			SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Just as some humanoid cultures believe that celibacy enhances their spiritual powers, illithid body tamers believe that reliance on psionics weakens their hard-won physical abilities. An abstinent illithid body tamer gains 10 temporary hit points, plus 4 temporary hit points per illithid body tamer level. If these hit points are lost to damage, the body tamer recovers them with 8 hours of rest. It also gains a +2 insight bonus on all melee damage rolls for tentacle and weapon attacks. To be considered abstinent, the body tamer must not have used any of its psionic abilities (including mind blast, charm monster, detect thoughts, levitate, plane shift, and suggestion) within the last 24 hours. If it uses any of these abilities, it does not have access to any of its usual benefits for abstinence until 24 hours after its last use of such an ability. An illithid body tamer is not slavishly devoted to its code. If using plane shift or mind blast is clearly in its best interest, then it does so, preferring to lose access to the benefits of abstinence than lose its life.
Strength of Arms			KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Strength of Arms				SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:When making a full attack with both a manufactured weapon and its tentacles, an illithid body tamer may designate either its tentacles or its weapon as its primary attack. If its weapon is its primary attack, it strikes with the weapon at its highest base attack bonus (making multiple attacks if its base attack bonus is high enough), but a -2 penalty applies to each tentacle attack made that round. If its tentacles are its primary attack, they strike at its highest base attack bonus, but it can strike only once with its manufactured weapon, and a -2 penalty applies to that attack. A body tamer using both weapon and tentacles can still withdraw the brains of foes with its tentacles as normal, whether or not the tentacles are its primary attack. However, it usually simply discards the brains and moves on to the next foe. Nourishment can wait.
Tentacle of Fate			KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Tentacle of Fate				SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:When an illithid body tamer reaches 3rd level, its base tentacle damage increases from 1d4 to 1d6.
Improved Trip			KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Improved Trip					SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 4th level, the illithid body tamer gains Improved Trip as a bonus feat.
Improved Disarm			KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Improved Disarm					SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 5th level, an illithid body tamer gains the use of the Improved Disarm feat when using its tentacles to perform the disarm action. It need not meet the normal prerequisites for the feat to use it in this way. The body tamer's tentacles are treated as a one-handed weapon for the purpose of disarm attempts.
Reaching Tentacle			KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Reaching Tentacle				SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:When an illithid body tamer attains 6th level, its reach with its tentacles increases by 5 feet. This adjustment stacks with the additional reach provided by tentacle extensions (see Chapter 5: Equipment and Magic Items), if such are in use.
Whirlwind Tentacle		KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Whirlwind Tentacle				SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 7th level, an illithid body tamer gains the use of the Whirlwind Attack feat when using its tentacles to perform such an attack. It need not meet the normal prerequisites for the feat to use it in this way. Because of its multiple tentacles and reaching tentacle ability, it can make one attack against every creature in the area it threatens, instead of just every creature within 5 feet.
Tentacle of Destiny		KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Tentacle of Destiny				SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:When an illithid body tamer reaches 8th level, its base tentacle damage increases from 1d6 to 1d8.
Death Whirlwind			KEY:Illithid Body Tamer ~ Death Whirlwind					SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illithid Body Tamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 10th level, an illithid body tamer psionically energizes its whirlwind tentacle ability with a death impulse once per day. When it uses this ability in combination with a whirlwind tentacle attack, every creature struck must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 15 + illithid body tamer's Con modifier) or die as if brought to -10 hit points. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.

# Imasari Vengeance Taker
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Imaskari vengeance takers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day			KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Spells per Day					SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At every even-numbered Imaskari vengeance taker level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and the like). If the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an Imaskari vengeance taker, the player must decide to which class to add each Imaskari vengeance taker level for the purpose of determining spells per day, spells known, and overall caster level.
Target of Vengeance		KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Target of Vengeance				SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Beginning at 1st level, an Imaskari vengeance taker may select a specific creature as the target of her vengeance. Her calculated study of this foe grants her a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks made against that one creature. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against her foe. Each time the Imaskari vengeance taker gains a new level in the prestige class, her bonuses against her target of vengeance increase by +1. To designate a target of vengeance, the Imaskari vengeance taker must spend one full day performing a set of special rites. She must either know the name of her foe or have met the individual at least once. An Imaskari vengeance taker may have only one target of vengeance at a time. She can designate a new target after successfully slaying her previous target or by spending three full days performing the necessary rituals. An Imaskari vengeance taker who has levels in the ranger class may add one-half the bonus noted above (rounded down) to her favored enemy bonus when attacking or using the indicated skills against a target of vengeance that is also one of her favored enemies.
Poison Use				KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Poison Use						SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 2nd level, an Imaskari vengeance taker learns to use poison effectively. She never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison to a blade.
Sneak Attack			KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Sneak Attack					SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 3rd level, an Imaskari vengeance taker learns the art of the sneak attack. If she can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, the vengeance taker's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the vengeance taker flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and it increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 7th level, and 4d6 at 9th level. Should the vengeance taker score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. An Imaskari vengeance taker can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range. With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, an Imaskari vengeance taker can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute a sneak attack. An Imaskari vengeance taker can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The vengeance taker must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A vengeance taker cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If the Imaskari vengeance taker is entitled to sneak attack damage from another source (such as rogue levels), the damage does stack
Far Sense				KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Far Sense						SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:Upon reaching 4th level, an Imaskari vengeance taker gains the ability to use clairaudience/clairvoyance (caster level equals 1/2 Imaskari vengeance taker's character level) to acquire information about her target of vengeance. This ability is usable once per day.
Seeker				KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Seeker						SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:Beginning at 6th level, an Imaskari vengeance taker can use divination (caster level equals 1/2 Imaskari vengeance taker's character level) to ask questions that bear on her target of vengeance. This ability is usable once per day.
Scry Target				KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Scry Target					SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:When an Imaskari vengeance taker reaches 8th level, she can attempt to see her target of vengeance from afar. This effect functions like the scrying spell (caster level equals 1/2 Imaskari vengeance taker's character level), except that the vengeance taker does not need a reflective surface, and the -5 penalty for knowing the target well applies to the Will save, even if the vengeance taker is not well acquainted with the target. This ability is usable once per week.
Death Attack			KEY:Imaskari Vengeance Taker ~ Death Attack					SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Imaskari Vengeance Taker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:If an Imaskari vengeance taker studies her target of vengeance for 3 rounds and then successfully deals damage to that individual via a sneak attack with a melee weapon, the target must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + vengeance taker level + vengeance taker's Intelligence modifier) or die. Success means the attack is resolved as a normal sneak attack. While studying the victim, the vengeance taker can undertake other actions so long as her attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the vengeance taker or recognize her as an enemy. Once the vengeance taker has completed her 3 rounds of study, she must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If the death attack is attempted and fails or if the vengeance taker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 more rounds of study are required before she can attempt another death attack. A vengeance taker does not have the option of paralyzing her victim with a death attack. A vengeance taker with levels in the assassin prestige class (see Chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) may add her assassin and vengeance taker class levels together for the purpose of calculating the save DC for her vengeance taker death attack.

# Inquisitor of the Drowning Goddess
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Inquisitor of the Drowning Goddess ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Inquisitor of the Drowning Goddess Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Inquisitors of the Drowning Goddess are proficient with steel fins (see Chapter 5: Equipment and Magic Items).

This effect lasts for 1 round per inquisitor level. Each foe in the area must make a Will save (DC 10 + inquisitor level + inquisitor's Cha modifier) or be affected as if by a fear spell (caster level equals inquisitor level). A new saving throw is required for each round that the creature remains in the area.

He gains a +2 bonus on grapple checks made to start or maintain a grapple and a +2 bonus on attack rolls made to disarm an opponent with his bare hands. When he reaches 4th level, each of these bonuses increases to +4.

Body-Coating Adhesive		KEY:Inquisitor of the Drowning Goddess ~ Body-Coating Adhesive		SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Inquisitor of the Drowning Goddess Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 5th level, an inquisitor of the Drowning Goddess can use his own body oil and other materials to give his body a finish almost like flypaper, which can hold fast any creatures or items that touch him. Anyone who makes an unsuccessful melee attack against an inquisitor so prepared must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 15 + inquisitor's Con modifier), or the weapon used in the attack sticks to the inquisitor and is yanked out of its wielder's grip. Creatures using natural weapons are automatically grappled if they get stuck. An inquisitor requires one hour and special materials costing 50 gp to coat his body with adhesive, but the secretion remains sticky for up to three days, or until it actually catches something or someone, whichever comes first. Successfully trapping a creature or item uses up the adhesive, so the inquisitor's body can trap no further creatures or items until its coating is replenished. Pulling a stuck weapon or limb from the inquisitor requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. An inquisitor can secrete a natural oil to break up and remove the adhesive any time he likes.

###Block: Prime Underdark Guide
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:Prime Underdark guides gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells				KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a prime Underdark guide gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, the prime Underdark guide must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a character with an Intelligence score of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Prime Underdark guide bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the prime Underdark guide's Intelligence modifier. When the prime Underdark guide gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 0 1st-level spells at 1st level), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to for that spell level based on her Intelligence score. A prime Underdark guide without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. The prime Underdark guide's spell list appears below. A prime Underdark guide prepares and casts spells just as a wizard does. She keeps her spells in a spellbook and must study them each morning. She can add to her spellbook by copying spells from wizards or from other prime Underdark guides

At 2nd level, she gains the ability to recall legends or information about various topics. This ability works like bardic knowledge (see the bard class entry in the Player's Handbook), except that the prime Underdark guide's bonus for an Underdark lore check is her character level + her Intelligence modifier. This ability applies only to information pertaining to the Underdark.
Underdark Traveler		KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Underdark Traveler			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:A prime Underdark guide is familiar with the culture and etiquette of many Underdark societies.

Danger Warning			KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Danger Warning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:When the prime Underdark guide reaches 3rd level, her danger sense becomes so acute that nearby companions become similarly sensitive. As a standard action, the prime Underdark guide can select one ally per class level within 30 feet to share her danger sense. Each of these designated allies gains a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps or natural hazards, a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks made by traps or natural hazards, and a +1 insight bonus on Spot checks made to spot creatures at the beginning of an encounter (see the Encounter Distance rules in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and the like).

Regardless of her prior classes, a Sea Mother whip gains the granted power of the Watery Death domain (see Chapter 4: Magic and Spells).

This power is useless against constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, and undead. Extraction is not instantly fatal to foes with multiple heads, such as ettins and hydras.

Unlike normal diseases but similar to mummy rot, all-consuming wasting continues until the afflicted creature's Constitution score reaches 0 (at which point it dies) or until a remove disease spell or similar magic (see Disease in the Dungeon Master's Guide) is applied. If an afflicted creature dies, it rises as a new all-consuming hunger 1d4 rounds after death.
Create Spawn		KEY:All-Consuming Hunger ~ Create Spawn				SOURCEPAGE:p.79	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:All-Consuming Hunger Racial Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Any living creature killed by an all-consuming hunger rises as a new all-consuming hunger within 1d4 rounds.

Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Concentration check. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Swarm Traits		KEY:All-Consuming Hunger ~ Swarm Traits				SOURCEPAGE:p.79	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:All-Consuming Hunger Racial Trait.SpecialQuality					DESC:A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. Reducing a swarm to 0 or fewer hit points causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple other creatures. A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as many evocation spells and grenadelike weapons. Swarms made up of Diminutive creatures are susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a gust of wind spell. For the purpose of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat it as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. Since an all-consuming hunger is undead, it takes no nonlethal damage from wind effects.

It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing. It also has darkvision out to 60 feet.
