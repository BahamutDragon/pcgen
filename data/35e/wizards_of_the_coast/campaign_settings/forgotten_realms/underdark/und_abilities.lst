Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:Prime Underdark guides gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells				KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a prime Underdark guide gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, the prime Underdark guide must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a character with an Intelligence score of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Prime Underdark guide bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the prime Underdark guide's Intelligence modifier. When the prime Underdark guide gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 0 1st-level spells at 1st level), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to for that spell level based on her Intelligence score. A prime Underdark guide without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. The prime Underdark guide's spell list appears below. A prime Underdark guide prepares and casts spells just as a wizard does. She keeps her spells in a spellbook and must study them each morning. She can add to her spellbook by copying spells from wizards or from other prime Underdark guides

At 1st level and every other level thereafter, a prime Underdark guide gains one bonus language of her choice. (She cannot choose secret languages as bonus languages with this ability.)
Aid Group				KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Aid Group				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:A prime Underdark guide is accustomed to managing and helping large groups of people.

At 2nd level, she gains the ability to recall legends or information about various topics.

Danger Warning			KEY:Prime Underdark Guide ~ Danger Warning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Prime Underdark Guide Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:When the prime Underdark guide reaches 3rd level, her danger sense becomes so acute that nearby companions become similarly sensitive. As a standard action, the prime Underdark guide can select one ally per class level within 30 feet to share her danger sense. Each of these designated allies gains a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps or natural hazards, a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks made by traps or natural hazards, and a +1 insight bonus on Spot checks made to spot creatures at the beginning of an encounter (see the Encounter Distance rules in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
