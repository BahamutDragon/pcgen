Acid Splash														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=0										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Acid														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One missile of acid																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.76				DESC:You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target. If you miss, there is no splash effect. The spell deals 1d3 points of acid damage.
Acid Storm														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Acid														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:Cylinder (20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)														DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.76				DESC:You cause acid to rain downward. The acid deals 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Focus: A flask of acid.
Alamanther's Return												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, M, XP			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:See text				TARGETAREA:One spell or spell-like abilities.															DURATION:See text							SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:See Text				COST:50	XPCOST:1000															SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.76				DESC:You duplicate the effect of any one spell or spell-like ability you have seen. This spell can only duplicate spells and spell-like abilities of 8th level or lower. This duplication functions like the ability of a wish spell to duplicate another spell, except that it is not limited by type of spell (divine or arcane) or by what school the effect is from. A duplicated spell or spell-like ability functions as if you had the appropriate spell prepared and were casting it yourself. If the casting time of the spell is greater than 1 full round, add 1 full round to the casting time of Alamanther's return. If the spell or ability has an XP cost, you must pay that XP cost in addition to the XP cost of this spell. If the spell has a costly material component, you must provide that component or pay an additional XP cost equal to the gp value of that component divided by 5. Alamanther of Aglarond, a former consort of the Simbul, created this spell. He was eventually destroyed in one of his frequent battles against the Red Wizards of Thay. Material Component: A silver mirror worth 50 gp. XP Cost: 1,000 XP or more.
Amanuensis														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3									SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Object or objects with writing.															DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.77				DESC:You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied into a book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell only copies nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as spell scrolls or a sepia snake sigil). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with explosive runes), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied. The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied. Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you may redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages. If this spell is used to copy a spell from a spellbook, you must provide the necessary costly materials as if you were copying it by hand (see Arcane Magical Writings, page 155 of the Player's Handbook). The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy. Material Component: Materials necessary for copying spells from a spellbook (if appropriate).
Amplify														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation								DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 minute								RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:A 15-ft-radius emanation centered on a creature, object or point in space								DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:See Text																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.77				DESC:You cause an amplification of all sounds within the spell's area. This decreases the DC to hear those sounds by 20. Those creatures within the spell's area do not notice the increased amplification. Thus, anyone whose voice is amplified remains unaware of the increase in volume.
Antimagic Aura													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7										SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.77				DESC:An invisible barrier surrounds a single creature and its equipment. The target creature is impervious to most magical effects including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines, thus preventing the target from casting spells or using spelllike abilities or magic items for the duration. An antimagic aura suppresses any spell or magical effect used on or by, or cast onto, the target, but does not dispel it. A charmed creature, for example, is not charmed while affected by the aura, but the spell resumes functioning when antimagic aura ends. Time spent within an antimagic aura counts against the suppressed spell's duration. Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.
Aura Against Flame												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=2												SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.78				DESC:You create an aura of blue mist that protects you against fire, absorbing the first 12 points of fire damage as an endure elements spell. In addition to the endure elements (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires. Any nonmagical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame's maximum damage is 12 or fewer points per round. This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist's fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them. You may use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) and attempt to dispel it as if using a dispel magic spell against it. If you succeed, the magical fire and the aura both vanish. If you fail, both remain. You may use a ready action to use the aura as a dispel magic to counterspell a magical fire attack against you. If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears. If you fail the dispel check or the attack is not a fire attack, nothing happens and the aura remains.
Aura of Glory													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=2												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, DF				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.78				DESC:You channel divine power into yourself, enhancing your physical presence and augmenting your magical abilities. For the duration of the spell, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Charisma checks to alter an NPC's attitude or turn undead. Your aura of glory provides an additional +2 sacred bonus on allied saves against fear. When the spell is cast, a number of allies equal to your paladin level are healed 1 hit point as if by a cure minor wounds spell. These allies must be within 10 feet of you at the time. Your mount counts as an ally.
Aura of Vitality													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=7												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature/3 levels, no two of which can be more than 30-ft apart									DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.78				DESC:All targets receive a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.
Azuth's Exalted Triad												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=6[PREDEITY:1,Azuth]									SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.78				DESC:You alter one of your prepared spells so that you can cast it multiple times before it is expended. The prepared spell must be of 3rd level or lower, and once the exalted triad is cast, you may cast the altered spell two additional times (a total of three times) before it is expended. The altered spell functions normally and requires components or XP for each use as if you were casting three separate spells. If you later choose to prepare a different spell in that spell slot, any extra castings provided by the exalted triad are lost. You cannot cast exalted triad more than once upon a prepared spell. This spell was created by the clerics of Azuth.
Azuth's Spell Shield												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Cleric=7[PREDEITY:1,Azuth]									SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Up to one creature/levels, no two of which can be more than 30-ft apart									DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.79				DESC:Each targeted creature gains spell resistance equal to 12 + caster level. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you target. In order to affect a creature who has spell resistance with a spell, a spellcaster must roll the creature's spell resistance or higher on 1d20 + caster level. A creature with spell resistance may voluntarily lower it in order to accept a spell.
Backlash														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:Permanent or until discharged			SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.79				DESC:You bestow upon the target an unusual curse: The first spell the target casts that meets the triggering conditions rebounds on the cursed creature exactly as if affected by spell turning. The backlash is triggered by three situations: - The target casts an attack spell on another creature, which makes its saving throw. - The target casts an attack spell upon a creature that is immune to that spell. - The target casts an attack spell that is interrupted or ruined (including a failed attempt to cast defensively). In all three cases, the triggering spell must be a spell that could be affected by spell turning. If the backlash is triggered, the curse immediately takes its full effect upon the target of the backlash. The target does not get a saving throw against the spell, nor does spell turning apply, but does get spell resistance. Once triggered, the backlash spell ends. A creature can be under the effects of multiple backlash spells at once, but only one can be triggered at a time. The backlash has no effect on magic items or spell-like or supernatural abilities used by the target. A backlash can be removed by any spell that negates a bestow curse spell. For purposes of this spell, an "attack spell" includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the caster's perceptions.) A spell directed at an unattended object does not constitute an attack spell.
Balagarn's Iron Horn												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=1|Sorcerer,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Transmutation								DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Cone																				DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None; See Text					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.79				DESC:You create a deep, resonant vibration that can shake creatures off their feet as if they were being tripped. Make a single Strength check as if your Strength were 20. Creatures in the area make individual opposed Dexterity or Strength checks against your roll. Those who fail are tripped and fall prone. Those who succeed are unaffected, but cannot make a trip attack against you in response to this spell. Unlike a regular trip attack, you may trip any creature touching the ground, regardless of size. You cannot use the Improved Trip feat to immediately make a melee attack against a creature you have tripped with this spell.
Ball Lightning													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Electricity													COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One or more balls of lightning, up to 1/level													DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.80				DESC:You create several balls of lightning that shed light as candles and move under your control. Your caster level is the total number of dice of damage (d6) that you can deal with this spell (maximum 15d6), divided however you see fit among the ball lightning. For example, a 9th-level caster could create nine balls of lightning (each dealing 1d6 points of electrical damage), or three balls of lightning (two dealing 2d6 and one dealing 5d6), and so on. You may direct any number of lightning balls to strike one target at a time. Each affects only one target and is not destroyed when it does so. Targets get a Reflex save against each ball that strikes them. You must have line of sight and line of effect to direct the balls. Directing the balls is a free action on the round the spell is cast and a standard action on any other round. The lightning balls can move up to 100 feet per round. A ball dissipates if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range. Material Component: A handful of copper and iron pellets.
Battering Ram													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Force														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One object or creature																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.80				DESC:You create a ramlike force that can strike with considerable power. Similar to a ring of the ram, the force can target a creature or an object. The force deals 1d6 hit points of damage to the target. If the target is a creature, this attack initiates a bull rush. (The force is considered a Large creature with Strength 25 for this purpose.) If the target is a movable object such as a door, the caster can make a Strength check (using the Strength of the battering ram) to attempt to open the door. Focus: A piece of carved ram's horn.
Battletide														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=5[PREDEITY:1,Xvim,Bane]								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:You and up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart							DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:No and Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.80				DESC:You steal energy from others. Targets other than you suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on saves, attack rolls, and damage rolls. As long as at least one enemy is affected by the spell, you get one extra partial action each round. If all the affected enemies free themselves from the spell (by death, entering an antimagic field, receiving a successful dispel magic, and so on), the spell ends.
Binding Winds													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=5												SCHOOL:Evocation																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:Concentration						SAVEINFO:Reflex negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.80				DESC:You create a flurry of air to encircle and hold your target. The binding winds do not move. They become a physical barrier surrounding the subject. The target may act normally, except that she cannot move from her current location. The winds carry her voice away, so she can speak but will not be heard, and she cannot hear anything but the roar of the winds. Furthermore, no sonic or language-dependent spells or effects may be cast into or out of the binding winds (though spells cast by the caster upon himself function normally). Ranged attacks made into or out of the binding winds suffer a -2 penalty. Binding winds hold flying creatures in midair.
Black Blade of Disaster												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation																	COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Sword-shaped planar rift																	DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 round/level		SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.81				DESC:You create a black bladeshaped planar rift about 3 feet long. The blade strikes at any creature within its range, as you desire, starting on the round you cast the spell. The blade makes a melee touch attack against its designated target once each round. Its attack bonus is your base attack bonus plus your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively). Anything hit by the blade takes 2d12 points of damage (bypassing the hardness of objects). The blade threatens a critical hit on an 18-20 and is considered a +5 weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. On a successful critical hit, the target suffers the effects of a disintegrate spell in addition to the normal damage from the blade. It can pass through any magical barrier equal to or less than its spell level, but cannot penetrate dead magic areas or an antimagic field. It can harm ethereal and incorporeal creatures as if it were a force effect. The blade always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. If the blade exceeds its range or goes out of your line of sight, the spell ends. You may direct the blade to attack another target as a standard action. A gate spell can be used to counterspell a black blade of disaster. A dimensional anchor spell cast at the blade dispels it automatically. The blade cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation can affect it. Its touch attack AC is 13.
Blackstaff														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Staff or quarterstaff touched																DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.81				DESC:Created by the renowned archmage Khelben Arunsun and shared only with those whom he trusts implicitly, blackstaff has three principal effects: First, the spell gives the affected staff or quarterstaff a +4 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. Second, any creature or object struck by a successful melee attack or melee touch attack with the blackstaff is subject to a dispel magic effect. This effect works exactly like a targeted dispel magic cast by the creator of the blackstaff. Third, any spellcaster struck by a successful melee or melee touch attack with the blackstaff loses one prepared spell (or one unused spell slot, for spellcasters who do not prepare spells) of the highest spell level available. A successful Will save negates the spell loss, but not any damage or dispel effects caused by a strike of the blackstaff. Blackstaff may be cast upon any nonmagical quarterstaff or on a magic staff in the caster's possession. If cast on a magic staff, the wielder of the staff must decide as a free action on his turn each round whether he will use the staff's normal abilities or the effects of the blackstaff spell. Nothing prevents the caster from giving a staff or quarterstaff under the effect of blackstaff to another character to wield after casting the spell. Focus: A nonmagical quarterstaff or a magic staff.
Blade Thirst													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=3												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One slashing weapon																	DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None (object)					SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.82				DESC:You grant a slashing weapon a +3 enhancement bonus. The weapon takes on a blue, fiery glow, shedding illumination as if it were a torch.
Blinding Spittle													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One missile of spit																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.82				DESC:Using a ranged touch attack (with a -4 penalty), you spit caustic saliva into your target's eyes. The spittle blinds your target until he can wash his eyes with water or other rinsing fluid. This spell has no effect on creatures without eyes or that don't depend on eyes for vision.
Blindsight														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=3|Cleric=4								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.82				DESC:This spell grants the Blindsight feat. The target creature gains sensitivity to vibrations, so that it maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. The target creature's senses extend to a 30-foot radius, and the creature need not make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within this range. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though the creature can't discern ethereal beings. (For details, see Blindsight, page 73 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide.)
Blood Frenzy													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=2												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.82				DESC:You enter a rage similar to, but less effective than, that of a barbarian. Your rage gives you a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus on Will saves. You suffer a -1 penalty to AC. The additional Constitution increases your hit points by 1 point/level, but these hit points go away when the spell ends. Otherwise, the effect is identical with barbarian rage (see page 25 of the Player's Handbook). You cannot use skills that require concentration or patience, and once the spell ends, you're fatigued for the duration of that encounter.
Body Blades														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=2[PREDEITY:1,Loviatar]								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.82				DESC:You sprout daggerlike spikes from all surfaces of your body and clothing. The spikes appear metallic but are not actually metal, and never harm you or interfere with your movement or actions. They allow you to deal 1d6 points of piercing damage (crit x2) with a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon, and the spell grants proficiency with them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. You inflict lethal damage when grappling. If a creature grapples you, the spikes deal 2 points of damage to your attacker. You get a +4 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from a net, rope, grappler, or spell that entangles.
Bombardment														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=8												SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation																	COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:15-ft.-radius burst centered on spot															DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex half (see text)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.82				DESC:You cause a rain of rocks to fall from the sky, burying your opponents. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8) and buries any target who fails his save. Buried subjects suffocate (see Suffocation, page 88 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide) until they climb from under the rocks (this is a full-round action). A buried creature has nine-tenths cover and concealment. Focus: A quartz crystal embedded in rock.
Branch to Branch													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 minute/level																																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.83				DESC:You gain a +10 competence bonus on Climb checks made in trees. You can brachiate (swing via branches and vines) at your normal speed.
Brilliant Aura													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=7												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One person per 2 levels, all of whom must be within 30 ft. of each other									DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.83				DESC:You limn your allies in a glowing nimbus, transforming their attacks into brilliant energy. All persons affected by this aura give off light as a torch (20-foot radius). Their weapon attacks (melee or ranged) function as if their weapons were brilliant energy weapons: They ignore nonliving matter and armor, and enhancement AC bonuses do not count against them. The attacks cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects. In addition, all attacks gain an enhancement bonus on damage equal to one-half the caster's level (maximum +10).
Cacophonic Shield													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=6									SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:10 ft.				TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you														DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.83				DESC:You create an immobile barrier of sonic energy at a distance of 10 feet from yourself. Creatures on either side of the barrier hear it as a loud but harmless buzzing. Nonmagical sound (including sound produced by a thunderstone) does not cross the barrier. If a sonic effect impinges upon the barrier, you get to make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of the effect to prevent it from affecting anyone inside the barrier. A creature that crosses the barrier takes 1d6 points of sonic damage plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +20) and must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The sonic vibrations provide a 20%% miss chance for any missiles crossing the barrier in either direction.
Camouflage														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid,Harper Scout,Ranger=1									SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:10 minutes/level																																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.83				DESC:You change your coloring to match the environment surrounding you. The spell grants you a +10 competence bonus on your Hide checks.
Cast in Stone													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=9												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Personal																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.83				DESC:Anyone meeting your gaze is permanently turned into a mindless, inert statue (as flesh to stone). You may free the victim of your own cast in stone at any time by speaking a command word you establish during the casting. Note: Each round, a gaze attack automatically works against one creature within range that is looking at (attacking or interacting with) the gazing creature. Creatures can avert their eyes, which grants them a 50%% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants the gazer one-half concealment (20%% miss chance) relative to them. Creatures can close their eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting them but grants the gazer total concealment (50%% miss chance) relative to them.
Celebration														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=4												SCHOOL:Enchantment				SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting|Sonic											COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:15-ft-radius burst																		DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.84				DESC:You cause any creatures in the area to feel increasingly more intoxicated the longer you perform a drinking song. You must perform for at least 1 full round to produce the first effects of the celebration spell. After that, each full round you perform increases the subject's intoxication, as described in the table below. A subject does not need to remain within the area, but those entering the area after the casting of the spell are not affected. Your targets receive only one saving throw at the onset of the spell. The effects last for the duration of your performance. If you stop performing, the effects do not worsen and fade after 1 round per caster level. Round Effect 1 None 2 -2 enhancement penalty to Dex, Int, and Wis 3 Nauseated 4 Helpless
Circle Dance													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric,Druid=3										SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 minute								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.84				DESC:You divine the relative direction and condition of another individual. During the casting of the spell, you think of your target as you do a spinning dance around the compass. You must have firsthand knowledge of your target for the spell to function. If the target is alive and on the same plane as you, the spell leaves you facing in the direction of your target. You also get an impression of the target's physical and emotional conditions (unharmed, wounded, unconscious, dying, and so on). If the target is on a different plane or dead, you feel nothing.
Claws of the Beast												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=1|Ranger=2										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level																																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.84				DESC:Your fingers sprout claws. Your hands become weapons that do 1d6 points of damage. If your normal unarmed damage is greater than 1d6, the damage does not change. You are considered armed while this spell is in effect.
Cloudburst														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=2												SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Water														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 round								RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:100-ft.-radius emanation																	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.84				DESC:You cause clouds to gather and a heavy rain to fall. The rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a -4 penalty on Spot and Search checks. It automatically extinguishes unprotected flames, and has a 50%% chance of extinguishing protected flames. Ranged weapon attacks and Listen checks are at a -4 penalty. This spell does not function indoors, underground, underwater, or in desert climates. After the spell ends, the water created evaporates over the next 10 minutes. The water created with this spell does not slake thirst or provide any nourishment to plants.
Cloud of Bewilderment												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Evocation																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:10 ft.				TARGETAREA:Cone																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.85				DESC:You breathe out an invisible cloud of noxious air. Anyone in the area is stunned and blinded for 1d6 rounds. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
Cocoon														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=8												SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation																	COMPS:V, S, M, XP			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One living creature																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fort negates					SPELLRES:Yes						XPCOST:1000															SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.85				DESC:You cause silkworm threads to encase your target in a cocoon. While in the cocoon, the subject is paralyzed. Gradually, the cocoon leeches energy from the subject until he dies, at which point the cocoon grants powers to its holder. Once per day, the subject receives one negative level. If these levels become permanent, the cocoon "stores" the lost energy in its silk threads (up to 10 levels). The cocoon has 100 hp and hardness 10. Hacking it off the subject eventually breaks the subject free. If the cocoon is not allowed to complete its draining of the subject, it becomes useless and conveys no benefits. However, when the victim is reduced to zero levels, he dies and the cocoon falls off, shrinking to the size of a walnut. You may then carry the cocoon and draw energy from it. If carried, the shrunken cocoon grants you a +4 enhancement bonus to the victim's highest ability score (for instance, if the victim's highest ability score was Wisdom, you would gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your Wisdom). In the case of a tie, you may select which bonus you get. If the victim had any ranks in a Knowledge skill, you gain an enhancement bonus on that skill check equal to the number of ranks possessed by the victim. If the victim was a spellcaster, you gain one free spell slot of the highest spell level the victim could cast (even if those spells were of a different class or type than your own). The cocoon grants these special powers for one day per level drained from the victim. If the victim is restored to life before this duration ends, the cocoon immediately loses all powers. Material Component: A silkworm cocoon. XP Cost: 1,000 XP.
Combust														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2[PRECLASS:1,Red Wizard=1]						SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Touched creature or combustible object that weights no more than 25 lbs/level.								DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.85				DESC:This spell makes a combustible object or a creature's combustible equipment burst into flame, even if damp. If the target is a creature, the initial eruption of flame causes 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) with no saving throw. Further, the creature must make a Reflex save (DC 15) or catch fire. (For details, see Catching on Fire, page 86 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide.) If the target is a combustible, unattended object, the initial eruption of flame inflicts fire damage on the object as noted above. The object catches fire and takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until consumed or someone puts out the fire. Anyone touching the object during the initial eruption of flame takes the same fire damage the object does. A Reflex save reduces damage by half. If a creature touching the object fails the Reflex save, it must make another Reflex save (DC 15) to avoid catching fire. Material Component: A drop of oil and a piece of flint.
Corrosive Grasp													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Acid														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature or creatures touched (up to one/level)													DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.85				DESC:Your hand becomes coated with a thick layer of acid that does not harm you or your equipment. A melee touch attack with this hand causes 1d6+1 points of acid damage. You may use this melee touch attack up to one time/level. If you grapple an opponent, you can deal this damage in addition to other damage you deal while grappling.
Crawling Darkness													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=5[PREDEITY:1,Shar]									SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation																	COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 minute/level (D)																																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.86				DESC:You bring into being a shroud of dark, writhing tentacles around your body. The tentacles do not interfere with your movement or spellcasting, but they provide you onehalf concealment (20%% miss chance) and totally hide your features. You get a +4 competence bonus on all grapple checks, Climb checks, and Escape Artist checks. The crawling darkness automatically protects you with feather fall if you ever fall more than 3 feet and allows you to water walk at will.
Create Crossroad and Backroad											TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=7												SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation																	COMPS:V, S, DF, XP		CASTTIME:1 day								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:two area of up to 50-ft-square																DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No							XPCOST:3500															SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.86				DESC:You form two crossroads and a backroad that links them. The crossroads are vertical, rectangular areas of up to 50 square feet each. You must have personally visited the end crossroads location in order to create the backroad. The spell summons a crossroads guardian and establishes a crossroads at each end. The crossroads guardians always start with a Helpful attitude toward their creator. The procedure requires your complete dedication and attention for a full day, preparing and nurturing the site, typically naturalizing it and removing signs of civilization. XP Cost: 3,500 XP.
Crumble														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=6												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One structure or construct																DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.86				DESC:You bring the forces of erosion to bear on a fabricated structure such as a stone bridge, a wooden building, an iron wall, a construct, or any other object not formed by nature itself. This inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the object (hardness does not apply), to a maximum of 15d6. This spell does not affect living creatures. It does, however, affect constructs. The maximum size of the object affected depends on your level. If you cast this spell on an object of greater size than you can affect, the spell fails. Level Size of Object Affected Up to 15 Huge 16-18 Gargantuan 19-20 Colossal
Curse of Ill Fortune												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=2[PREDEITY:1,Beshaba]								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One living creature																	DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.86				DESC:You place a temporary curse upon the target, giving her a -3 enhancement penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. Curse of ill fortune is removed by any spell that removes a bestow curse spell.
Darkfire														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=3[PREDEITY:1,PANTHEON.Drow]							SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:0 ft.					TARGETAREA:Flame in your palm																		DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.86				DESC:Dark flames appear in your hand. You can hurl them or use them to touch enemies. The flames appear in your open hand and harm neither you nor your equipment. They emit no light but produce the same amount of heat as an actual fire. You can strike opponents with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d4+1 points per two caster levels (maximum +10). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. The darkfire is invisible to normal vision but can be seen with darkvision as easily as a normal flame can be seen in darkness (this means that darkfire can be used as a signal or beacon for creatures with darkvision). The spell does not function underwater.
Dark Way														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=3[PREDEITY:1,Mask]									SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Shadow																		COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One bridge of force 2-ft wide, 1 in. Thick and up to 20-ft/level long									DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.87				DESC:You create a ribbonlike, weightless, unbreakable bridge. The dark way must be anchored at both ends to solid objects, but otherwise can be at any angle. Like a wall of force, it must be continuous and unbroken when formed. It is typically used to cross a chasm or a hazardous space. Creatures can move on the dark way without penalty, since it is no more slippery than a typical dungeon floor. You (but not anyone else) gain a +5 competence bonus on all Balance checks while made on the dark way. The dark way can support a maximum of 200 pounds per caster level. Creatures that cause the total weight on the dark way to exceed this limit sink through it as if it weren't there. You never sink through the dark way unless your own weight exceeds the spell's maximum capacity.
Darsson's Potion													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Flask of water touched																	DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.87				DESC:You transform the water in a flask so that it is capable of storing a spell in the manner of a potion. On your next turn, you or another spellcaster can cast a spell into the water, transforming the water into a potion of the appropriate type. Only spells suitable for making potions can be used this way. The person casting the spell to be stored must spend XP as if a potion were being created with the Brew Potion feat.
Deafening Clang													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=1[PREDEITY:1,Gaerdal Ironhand]							SCHOOL:Transmutation								DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Weapon touched																		DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless,object)		SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.87				DESC:You empower the touched weapon with magic that causes it to emit a loud clang when it is struck against a hard surface, such as a floor, wall, or creature. The item can create this noise once per round. The clang has the effect of a thunderstone (see page 114 of the Player's Handbook) except that the caster and the weapon user are unaffected by the sound and the deafness lasts 1 minute. If an attack with the weapon misses the target but was enough to make a touch attack, the weapon strikes the creature with sufficient force to activate the deafening clang.
Death Armor														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes				COST:50																	SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.87				DESC:You are surrounded with a crackling black aura that injures creatures that contact it. Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons takes 1d4 hit points of damage +1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +5). If the creature has spell resistance, it applies to the damage. Weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. Material Component: A paste made of exotic herbs, ground bones, and onyx worth 50 gp, which is applied to your body when the spell is cast.
Death Dragon													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=7												SCHOOL:Necromancy									DESCRIPTOR:Evil|Fear|Mind-Affecting											COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:Dragon of energy and bones																DURATION:1 round/level (D)																																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.88				DESC:You summon unholy power to gird yourself in a dragonshaped cocoon of bones and negative energy. The cocoon gives you a +4 natural armor bonus and a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class, plus 1 temporary hit point per caster level (maximum +20). You are treated as armed when you make unarmed attacks, and deal damage as if your limbs were short swords. You can use your off hand to attack, incurring the standard two-weapon fighting penalties (see Table 8-2, page 125 of the Player's Handbook). The death dragon prevents you from casting spells with somatic, material, or focus (but not divine focus) components, but does not otherwise hinder your actions or movement. As a standard action, you may project a cone of fear or make a melee touch attack to use inflict critical wounds on the creature touched.
Death Pact														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=8[PREDEITY:1,Velsharoon]								SCHOOL:Necromancy									DESCRIPTOR:Evil														COMPS:V, S, M, DF, XP		CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Willing living creature touched															DURATION:Permanent until triggered				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.88				DESC:This spell allows the target to enter a binding agreement with your deity that brings the target back to life if she is slain. When this spell is cast, the target's Constitution is permanently lowered by 2 points. In exchange for this, if she ever dies, several spells are brought into effect. First, she is teleported to a safe location designated by you at the time of casting as if with a word of recall spell. Second, the target is brought back from the dead with a raise dead spell with the standard loss of a level. Finally, the target is healed with a heal spell. She does not regain the 2 Constitution points when returned to life. If a raise dead spell could not return the target to life (for example, if she was disintegrated or died of old age), the death pact cannot restore her to life. If the spell is dispelled before the target dies, she does not regain her 2 lost Constitution points. Material Component: A diamond worth at least 500 gp. XP Cost: 250 XP.
Decoy Image														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=3												SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Figment																		COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:Figment that mimics you and all allies within 50-ft of you.											DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.88				DESC:In order to flush ambushes, you project a duplicate image of yourself and your companions. This spell creates an illusion complete with visual, sound, smell, texture, and temperature. It mimics exactly what you and any of your allies within 50 feet of you do. If the terrain differs significantly between that of the illusion and that of the characters, or if any character takes an action the illusion can't duplicate (for instance, climbing a tree if none are present for the illusory duplicate to mimic), onlookers automatically receive a saving throw. In addition, anyone who moves out of the spell's effect disappears from the illusion.

Detect Crossroads													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Bard,Druid=0											SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:60 ft. or 1 mile (see text)	TARGETAREA:Quarter circle emanating from you to the extreme of the range										DURATION:Concentration up to 10 minutes/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.88				DESC:You can see fey crossroads within 60 feet, if your visibility isn't blocked. A crossroads appears to you as a bluehued, x-shaped shadow upon the ground. You recognize the crossroads for what it is, and won't be fooled by a false or illusory one. Detect crossroads gives you no information on where the backroad leads. If the nearest crossroads is less than a mile away, but blocked visually from you either by distance or barriers, you can still sense its general direction. Each round, you can turn to detect in a new direction. See the previous chapter for more on crossroads.
Dhulark's Glasstrike												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close	RANGE:60 ft.		TARGETAREA:One creature or 4 cubic ft. of material														DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.89				DESC:You transform the target into glass. You can cast either of these two versions: Glass Creature: As flesh to stone, but the target becomes glass. Glass Object: An object of up to 4 cubic feet in volume is affected. Part of a larger object (such as a floor or wall) can be transformed by this spell. Neither version of the spell affects magic items (magic items carried by a transformed creature remain intact). When the duration ends, the target returns to its original materials. If the target was broken or damaged while in glass form, its normal form has similar damage. Focus: A piece of glass from a mirror.
Dimensional Lock													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=8									SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:15-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space												DURATION:1 day/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.89				DESC:You create a field that completely blocks bodily extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, phasing, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. The dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms such as a basilisk's gaze. Dimensional lock does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of the summoning spell. Once the spell is in place, however, extradimensional travel into or out of the affected area is not possible.
Dirge															TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=6												SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:50 ft.				TARGETAREA:All enemies within a 50-ft.-radius burst centered on you											DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.89				DESC:Your song draws the energies of death and destruction down on your enemies. Each round, any enemy in the area suffers 2 points of temporary Strength and Dexterity damage. A successful saving throw only negates that round's affect; a new saving throw is required each round to avoid that round's damage.
Disguise Undead													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Glamer																		COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One corporeal undead																	DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:None (harmless)																												SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.89				DESC:You make one undead-including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment-look different. You can make it seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change the creature's body type. For example, a wight could look human, humanoid, or like any other generally human-shaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature, such as a mole or a beard, or make it look like an entirely different creature. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. It does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the undead or its equipment. A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe. Note: Creatures get Will saves to recognize the glamer as an illusion if they interact with it (such as by touching the undead and having that sensory input not match what they see, in the case of this spell). Focus: A cocoon of a death's head moth.
Disquietude														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=1												SCHOOL:Abjuration									DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One living creature																	DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.90				DESC:Your song or poem instills a feeling of paranoia in your target. The affected target restricts her movement to avoid any physical contact, even with allies. If she is attacked in melee and can't flee, she uses the full defense option.
Distort Speech													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.90				DESC:You distort a creature's vocalizations. The voice of the affected target becomes warped and incomprehensible. The subject loses the ability to cast spells with verbal components for the duration of the spell.
Doomtide														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=4[PREDEITY:1,Beshaba]								SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Pattern																		COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:80 ft.				TARGETAREA:Eight 10-ft. cubes extending from the caster's location											DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.90				DESC:You fill an area with illusory black, creeping mist that vaguely resembles thousands of slender grasping tentacles. You and one creature you touch are immune to the effect of this spell and can see through it without difficulty. When you cast the spell, you decide if the effect remains stationary or moves away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round. The mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment (attacks suffer a 20%% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50%% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the doomtide in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 1 round. Furthermore, creatures within its area must make Will saves or be dazed for as long as they remain in the cloud. The spell does not function underwater.
Drown															TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=6												SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation																	COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One living creature																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fort negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.90				DESC:You create water in the lungs of the subject, which begins to drown. The subject immediately falls unconscious, dropping to 0 hp. In the following round, it drops to -1 hit points and is dying. In the following round, it dies. (For details, see The Drowning Rule, page 85 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide.) Coughing and other attempts by the victim to physically expel the water are useless. However, any time before death it can be stabilized with a Heal check (DC 15). Undead, constructs, creatures who do not need to breathe, and creatures who can breathe water are unaffected by this spell.
Earthfast														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=2												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One stone structure or rock formation, up to 25 cu ft/level											DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:Fort negates (harmless,object)		SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.90				DESC:You reinforce a rock formation or stone structure. The earthfast spell doubles the structure's hit points and hardness. The spell collapses if you move beyond the range of the spell. This does not function on constructs.
Easy Climb														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=3												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:Vertical path 10 ft. wide and 20 ft. tall/level													DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None (object)					SPELLRES:Yes (object)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.91				DESC:You create a path of handholds and footholds up the surface of a cliff-face, tree trunk, wall, or other vertical obstacle. This changes the surface to the equivalent of a very rough wall (DC 10 to climb).
Easy Trail														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid,Harper Scout,Ranger=2									SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:30-ft. cone trailing behind you															DURATION:1 hour/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.91				DESC:You radiate an energy that gently pushes plants aside, allowing easy passage and hiding your trail after you pass. Anyone in the area of the spell (including the caster) finds the undergrowth held aside while they pass. This essentially provides a "trail" through any terrain (see Table 9-5: Terrain and Overland Movement, page 143 of the Player's Handbook). Once the effect of the spell passes, the plants return to their normal shape. The DC to track anyone who traveled within the area of this spell is increased by +5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail). This spell has no effect on plant creatures (that is, they aren't pushed or held aside).
Echo Skull														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=5												SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Animal skull touched																	DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:None (object)					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.91				DESC:You can see, hear, and speak through a specific dried animal skull at any distance. As long as you and the skull remain on the same plane, you can see and hear as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch your perception from its location to your own or back again as a free action. If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is greater than touch (and which does not require a material component or focus) can originate from the skull instead of from you. If the skull is destroyed, the spell ends. Casting a spell through the skull costs 10 XP per spell level. Focus: A dried animal skull.
Electric Jolt													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=0										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Electricity													COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature or object																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.91				DESC:You release a small stroke of electrical energy. You must make a ranged touch attack to deal damage to a target. The spell deals 1d3 points of electricity damage.
Elminster's Effulgent Epuration										TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9										SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:60 ft.

Energy Tranformation Field											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, M, XP			CASTTIME:4 full rounds							RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:40-ft radius spread																	DURATION:Permanent						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No					COST:5000	XPCOST:250															SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.91				DESC:You create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energy from magic items or spellcasting in order to power another spell tied to that location. For example, you could have an energy transformation field tied to a summon monster V spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic. The field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Supernatural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast fireball spell or a charge from a wand of fireballs would add three spell levels to the field's store, a potion of cure light wounds would add one, and a wish from a ring of three wishes would add nine. Effects that don't have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so an immovable rod would provide 2 spell levels every time it was activated because of its levitate prerequisite). Effects that are absorbed give no indication as to where the magic went; they simply vanish. The field only absorbs magic actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a continual flame would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected. An energy transformation field has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field as designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field's concentration is only interrupted by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the energy transformation field. Typical spells linked to an energy transformation field are blindness/deafness, fireball, suggestion, summon monster, and wall of force. Spells that have a costly material component or an XP cost cannot be linked to a field, but those with a costly focus can be if the focus object is present within the field (typically sealed into a wall or in a secret compartment). Halaster of Undermountain reputedly links false vision spells to thwart those who would spy on his master dungeon. Only Mordenkainen's disjunction, limited wish, wish, or similar spells can destroy the energy transformation field. Spells of lower level such as dispel magic and greater dispelling are absorbed by it, and an antimagic field prevents it from absorbing magical energy within the field but does not otherwise hamper this spell. If two or more field spells share an overlapping area, each field has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area. Material Component: Three drops of your blood, an eye from any humanoid, and 5,000 gp worth of powdered diamond. XP Cost: 250 XP.
Explosive Cascade													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One 5-ft square/level, all of wich must be connected in one continuous path								DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.93				DESC:You cause a bright ball of flame to bound and skip across the battlefield, damaging targets within its area. The area is the path of the flame, and it deals 1d6 hit points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures and objects within its area. The flame lights up the area as if it were a torch. Small sparks and decaying flames remain in the area for 1 round, shedding light as candles but dealing no damage. If the damage from the flame destroys an interposing barrier, the flame can move beyond the barrier if it has not reached its maximum area. Material Component: Bat guano, sulfur, and copper packed into a metal tube with one closed end.

The spell only works on a creature with the same patron as you. A target with no patron or a different patron than you is unaffected by the spell, even if the target would normally be harmed by positive energy.

You may take the form of any fiendish creature, demon, or devil that can be summoned by summon monster I-VI. You cannot assume multiple forms with each use of the spell, but you gain all the creature's extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities. Your type changes to outsider, and spells and effects that harm or ward evil outsiders affect you. A spell that would banish you to your home plane ends this spell and leaves you staggered for 1 round per caster level, but does not send you to another plane. Material Component: A bone from any fiendish creature, half-fiendish creature, demon, or devil.
Fire Spiders													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:240 fiery spiders that cover a 20-ft radius spread												DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes				COST:500																	SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.94				DESC:You call forth a swarm of 240 fire elementals the size of common spiders. The fire spiders each have 1/4 d8 HD (1 hp), speed 10 ft., climb 10 ft., and AC 18 (+8 size). They distribute themselves evenly within the initial area of the spell (six creatures per 5-foot square), and after the first round they move as a swarm, seeking creatures and objects to attack and ignite. The attacks by the fire spiders in a 5-foot-square area can be treated as an area attack by the group, inflicting fire damage equal to the number of spiders in that square (a Reflex saving throw halves the damage). Unlike with a creeping doom spell, the fire spiders do not die after inflicting damage, and only disappear if they are slain, the spell duration expires, or they are somehow banished to their home plane. Fire spiders can ignite flammable objects if they rest on one for 2 or more rounds. As fire elementals, the fire spiders are immune to fire and are thwarted by barriers that block neutral outsiders. Water or other nonflammable liquid (including acid) kills them, a flask destroying 2d4 fire spiders in a targeted 5- foot square and causing 1 point of splash damage to adjacent squares (killing one spider in each adjacent square). If some of the creatures die, the swarm condenses, growing smaller in area, maintaining the density of six creatures per 5-foot area. Thousands of years ago, the drow used this spell to set on fire a large portion of what is now the Border Forest, separating it further from the forest of Cormanthor. Material Component: A handful of rubies or ruby dust worth at least 500 gp.
Firebrand														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One 5-ft radius burst/level																DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.94				DESC:You create up to one mass of flame per level to explode upon the battlefield. Each mass of flame is treated as a 5-foot-radius burst and deals 1d6 points of fire damage/ level (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within the area. The bursts do not need to be contiguous, and may be distributed within range as you see fit. Burst effects that overlap do not inflict additional damage. Material Component: A flask of alchemist's fire.
Flame Dagger													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Hathran=2	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2[PRECLASS:1,Red Wizard=1]			SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:0 ft.					TARGETAREA:A daggerlike beam																		DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.94				DESC:A 1-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this bladelike beam as if it were a dagger. Attacks with the flame dagger are melee touch attacks, and the blade deals 1d4 points of fire damage plus 1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +10). Because the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. The flame dagger can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, and so on. This spell does not function underwater. Material Component: A candle, not necessarily lit.
Force Ladder													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Force														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One ladder of force up to 60-ft long															DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.95				DESC:You create a transparent ladder made of force. The ladder is two feet wide and anywhere from 10 to 60 feet long, with rungs spaced 1 foot apart. The ladder functions as a normal ladder. Because it is a force object, it can block or be used as a weapon against incorporeal or ethereal creatures (although they normally can move through the walls or floor to go around the ladder if used as a barricade, and only creatures capable of wielding a 10-foot-long or larger weapon could use the ladder offensively against such a creature). The ladder weighs 1 pound and can support 100 pounds of weight per caster level. It can be destroyed by anything that destroys a wall of force. Focus: A miniature silver ladder.
Forceward														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=3[PREDEITY:1,Helm]	CLASSES:Paladin=3						SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:10 ft.				TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you														DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.95				DESC:You create an unmoving, transparent sphere of force centered on your location. The sphere illuminates its interior and everything within 5 feet of its edge. You and your allies may enter the sphere at will. Any other creature that tries to enter the sphere must make a Will saving throw, otherwise it cannot pass into the area defined by the sphere. A creature may leave the area freely, although it must make a Will save to enter again, even if the creature is you or one of your allies. Creatures within the area when the spell is cast are not forced out. The forceward does not prevent spells or objects from entering the forceward, so it is possible for two creatures on opposite sides of the forceward's edge to fight without penalties (although creatures using unarmed attacks or natural weapons still have to make Will saves every round for their attacks to have a chance of entering the forceward).
Forcewave														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:Wave of force affecting one creature															DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fort partial					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.95				DESC:You cause a wave of visible force resembling a crashing ocean wave to appear and immediately impact a single target. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4+1 hit points of damage and must make an opposed Strength check to avoid a bull rush. The wave of force has Strength 18, is Medium-size, and is considered charging for the purpose of this check, and always moves the target the maximum distance possible. If the wave of force fails the opposed Strength check, the target is not moved. If the target makes its saving throw, it takes 1 hit point of damage and avoids the bull rush attempt. Focus: A small piece of string and a drop of water.
Fortunate Fate													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=7[PREDEITY:1,Tymora]									SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Healing																		COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 minute								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:10 minutes/level or until discharged		SAVEINFO:None (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.95				DESC:You surround the subject with an aura that immediately heals her if she suffers an attack that would kill her (reduce her hit points to -10 or below). When this event occurs, the fortunate fate spell intervenes by immediately triggering a heal spell upon the target. If the attack is one that causes harm in a way that a heal spell can repair (disease, hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or poison), the target does not actually die, saved by the heal. If the attack is one that heal cannot countermand (such as ability drain, old age, negative levels, disintegration, ability drain, or death effects), the fortunate fate spell cannot prevent her death. If this spell is cast upon an undead creature, it uses a harm spell instead of heal.
Gedlee's Electric Loop												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Electricity													COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:5-ft radius burst																		DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex half (see text)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.95				DESC:You create a small stroke of lightning that cycles through all creatures in the area. The spell deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). Those who fail their Reflex saves must succeed at a Will save or be stunned for 1 round. Material Component: A loop of copper wire and a magnet.
G'Elsewhere Chant													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=3												SCHOOL:Transmutation				SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation	DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One creature or object																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.96				DESC:You teleport a target to a random, safe location up to 100 feet distant and visible to you. To randomly determine the subject's destination, roll 1d8 to determine the direction, then roll 1d10 times 10 to determine the distance from the subject's previous location. Roll direction and distance again if this new destination is outside your line of sight, within a solid object, or more than 5 feet above ground. If your target is being held (whether an object held by a character or a character being grappled by a creature), the holding or grappling creature also receives a Will saving throw to resist.
Gemjump														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7										SCHOOL:Transmutation				SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation																	COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Unlimited				TARGETAREA:You and objects and willing creatures totaling up to 50 lbs/level										DURATION:Until triggered					SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:See Text																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.96				DESC:This spell teleports you to the location of a specially prepared gem. You initially cast gemjump upon a rogue stone (see the next chapter), which you must touch. At any time after you prepare the stone you can utter a command word, and instantly teleport to the location of the gem, provided you and the stone are on the same plane. The teleport is always on target (as though you are using a teleport without error spell). If the area containing the gem is too small for you, you appear in the nearest sufficiently large space. You can transport, in addition to yourself, objects and creatures weighing up to 50 pounds per caster level. Thus, a 15th-level wizard could transport his person and objects or creatures weighing an additional 750 pounds. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. An unwilling creature can't be teleported by gemjump. Likewise, a creature's Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw. You can only have one gemjump spell cast on a particular rogue stone at a time, but any number of other wizards can use the same stone you're using. Focus: A rogue stone.
General of Undeath.MOD												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=8[PREDEITY:1,Velsharoon]								SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 day/level																																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.96				DESC:You increase the number of Hit Dice of undead that you can control. Add 10 times your caster level to your Hit Dice limit for controlling undead. When the duration expires, you lose control of the extra undead as if you had voluntarily relinquished control of them.
Ghorus Toth's Metal Melt											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation								DESCRIPTOR:Fire														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Metal object weighting up to 5 lb/level														DURATION:1 round							SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.96				DESC:You alter the physical properties of a metal object so that it runs like water. The melted metal does not change temperature but flows as a liquid for 1 round and then returns to its normal solid state, usually in a form resembling a puddle. If the object is a magic item, this renders it broken and nonfunctional, although a character with the appropriate item creation feat can repair it. Material Component: A drop of mercury in a vial.
Ghostharp														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=0												SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 minute								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Any object																			DURATION:5 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.97				DESC:You prepare an object that records and replays a song previously played or sung in its vicinity. When cast, the spell searches a radius of 50 feet for the lingering notes of a tune played there within the last day. It records these notes and reverberations. If multiple songs have been played at that spot, ghostharp recalls the song most recently played, starting with the beginning of the piece recalled. At your verbal command, "Play," the ghostharp replays the music. The tune repeats until you command it to stop, or until the spell's duration comes to an end. The ghostharp does not record conversations. Its imperfect replay can't reproduce bardic music or other magical effects, nor can it cast spells.
Glory of the Martyr												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=4[PREDEITY:1,Ilmater]								SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, F, DF																			TARGETAREA:One creature/level																																																											SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.97				DESC:As shield other, except as noted above. All creatures are linked to you so you suffer half of their damage. If you die while this spell is in effect, the spell ends in a burst of positive energy that heals 1d8 hit points for each creature linked to you.
Great Thunderclap													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:5-ft radius spread																		DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.98				DESC:You create a loud noise equivalent to a peal of thunder and its accompanying shock wave. The spell has three effects. First, all creatures in the area must make Will saves to avoid being stunned for 1 round. Second, the creatures must make Fortitude saves or be deafened for 1 minute. Third, they must make Reflex saves or fall prone. Focus: An iron bell.
Gutsnake														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:One magical snakelike tentacle																DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.98				DESC:You sprout a 15-foot-long tentacle from your stomach that can attack enemies. The tentacle has no eyes but ends in a pair of snapping reptilian jaws. The tentacle is equivalent to a giant constrictor snake except that it is completely obedient to you and moves as you command it. Attacks against the tentacle cause you no discomfort and do not disrupt your spellcasting. If "killed," the tentacle disappears without causing harm to you. The tentacle does not interfere with spellcasting in any way. As a free action on your turn, you may have the tentacle attack (as a giant constrictor), and if it successfully hits, it can constrict. Each round the gutsnake is constricting a target, you may not move more than 5 feet away from the target, unless you are strong enough to drag it with you. This is the only way in which the tentacle restricts movement. While the snake is present, you may use its Balance and Climb skill modifiers instead of your own. Focus: A fang from any reptile.
Handfire														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=1[PREDEITY:1,Selune]	CLASSES:Druid,Harper Scout,Hathran,Ranger=1	SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Light														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.98				DESC:You surround your hand with winking motes of light resembling a cluster of constantly renewed sparks. The lights are any color you choose, but cannot be changed once the spell is cast. The handfire provides illumination equal to a candle but provides no heat, nor can it ignite objects. The handfire can be used as a melee touch attack up to one time per level. If a living creature is struck, it deals 1d4 points of damage +1 point/level (maximum +5). Against undead, the handfire deals 1d6 points of damage +1 point/level (maximum +5). It has no effect on targets
Hand of Divinity													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Blackguard,Cleric,Paladin=2									SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:See text					VARIANTS:Good|Evil					COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); See text	SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.98				DESC:You give the subject a protective aura of divine energy that allows her a bonus on all saving throws. If your patron is nonevil, this is a +2 sacred bonus and the spell is a good spell. If your patron is evil, this is a +2 profane bonus and the spell is an evil spell. This spell only works on a creature with the same patron as you or the same alignment as your patron. If cast on a target that does not meet these criteria, there is no effect.
Hand of Torm													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=4[PREDEITY:1,Torm]	CLASSES:Paladin=4						SCHOOL:Abjuration									DESCRIPTOR:See text													COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 minute								RANGE:10 ft.				TARGETAREA:10-ft radius emanation centered on you														DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:Fort negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.99				DESC:You create an immobile zone of warding that is permeable to those of your religion but repels all others. The warded area has a shimmering visible border, above which is a ghostly image of a giant hand (the appearance of the hand depends upon your patron, so Torm's clerics have a shining metal gauntlet, while those of Bane have a black clawed metal gauntlet and those of Malar have a great beast's claw). Creatures that have the same patron as you, or are wearing a holy symbol of your patron, can enter and move within the warded area unhindered. Other creatures that try to enter or move within the area must make Fortitude saves or be stunned for 1 round. If a creature's only action is to try to move completely out of the area, the ward does not hinder it. Clerics and paladins of deities other than Torm name this spell after their own deity-hand of Ilmater, for example. This spell has the alignment components of your patron, so if your patron is Torm, this is a lawful and good spell.
Hardening														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One item of a volume no greater than 10 cu. ft./ level (see text)										DURATION:Permanent						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes (object)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.99				DESC:This spell increases the hardness of materials (see Table 8-12: Substance Hardness and Hit Points, page 136 of the Player's Handbook). Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material's resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (treat steel as iron, base hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have a new hardness of 16 for purposes of ignoring damage caused by someone using the Sunder feat. The sword's hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. The hardening spell does not in any way affect resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on. This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet/level of the spellcaster. If cast upon a metal or mineral, the spell's volume is reduced to 1 cubic foot/level.

When under the effect of this spell, you grant a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls when you use your inspire courage bardic ability. The effect lasts as long as the effect of your inspire courage lasts. If you don't begin to inspire courage within 1 minute of casting this spell, the effects of harmony end.

The healing sting cannot give you more hit points than your normal total. Excess hit points are lost. Material Component: Five dried wasp bodies.

You may heal up to 1d6 points per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), and must decide how many dice to roll when you cast the spell. You take damage equal to the amount your target was healed. This spell cannot heal a target of more than your current hit points +10, which is enough to kill you.

It has three functions, and you can designate which function to activate as a free action on your turn. Spell Turning: The holy star can turn four to seven (1d4+3) spell levels as the spell turning spell.

If all spell levels are expended, this function no longer works but the other functions do. Cover: The holy star gives you a +10 cover bonus to AC without affecting your actions. Fire Bolt: The holy star lashes out with a beam of energy as a ranged touch attack against a creature up to 90 feet away, dealing fire damage equal to 1d4 points +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10).

If used to attack, the cone inflicts 1 point of sonic damage per two levels each round a creature is within the area; a successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half. If used to move objects or creatures, it functions as the sustained force version of telekinesis, although you can only move objects away from you. Targets within the effect of a silence spell cannot be moved. The spell's sound is a sustained hum as loud as a battle. Focus: A hollow cone of brass and gold worth 50 gp.

The subject's clothing, items, hair and flesh burn with ferocity. The fire deals 2d6 points of damage per round until the spell ends or the subject manages to extinguish the flames. Flammable, nonmagical items carried by the target automatically fail their saves to resist this damage. Against creatures lacking flammable flesh, hair, clothing, and items, the spell has no effect. After the first round, the target can take a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking additional damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15) to extinguish the flames. Rolling on the ground allows the character a +2 bonus. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the flames. Material Component: A gob of beeswax.

The wolves act on their own but obey your mental commands.

You become gaunt and pale with feral red eyes, and you gain the following supernatural abilities: - enervation (as a melee touch attack) - vampiric touch (as a melee touch attack) - charm person - gaseous form (self only) - damage reduction 10/+1 When using this spell, inflict spells heal you and cure spells hurt you. You are treated as if you were undead for the purpose of all spells and effects. A successful turn (or rebuke) attempt against an undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be panicked (or cowering) for 10 rounds. A turn attempt that would destroy (or command) undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will save (DC 15 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be stunned (or charmed as with charm monster) for 10 rounds.

DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 round/level		SAVEINFO:None; See Text					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.103				DESC:This spell evaluates the creatures in the area and determines the relative power level of each. Creatures are evaluated as follows: CR Strength 4 or less Weak 5-10 Moderate 11-15 Strong 16+ Overwhelming Among creatures within the same category, you know which is the most powerful, but not why. For example, among a group of ogres (CR 2), you would know one of them (an ogre with 2 levels of barbarian, CR 4) was the most powerful, but not know if it was because the ogre had class levels, because of a template (such as half-fiendish), or for other reasons. Any spell of 3rd level or higher that prevents scrying attempts on a creature (such as nondetection) or area (such as false vision) thwarts this spell's ability to evaluate that creature or creatures within that area.
Know Protections													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=1									SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.104				DESC:You learn many of the unusual defenses the target creature has. The spell tells you the creature's damage reduction, spell resistance, and any resistances or immunity to energy attacks. For example, if cast upon a vampire, you learn that it has damage reduction 15/+1, and cold and electricity resistance 20; you do not learn about its fast healing or turn resistance. If cast upon a pit fiend, you learn that it has damage reduction 25/+2, spell resistance 28, is immune to fire, and has acid and cold resistance 20; it does not tell you any of its other defenses, such as fast healing or immunity to poison.

Vulnerabilities include anything that causes the creature more than the normal amount of damage (such as a creature with the cold subtype taking double damage from fire or a crystalline creature's vulnerability to the shatter spell). Resistances include any effects that reduce or negate damage the creature takes and immunities to particular attacks. The spell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects. For example, if cast upon an iron golem, you learn that it has all the construct defenses, damage reduction 50/+3, is slowed instead of damaged by electricity, is healed instead of damaged by fire, and is vulnerable to rust attacks. If cast upon a balor, you learn that it has damage reduction 30/+3, spell resistance 28, is immune to poison and electricity, has acid, cold, and fire resistance 20, and does not have any particular vulnerabilities.

Your hand gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage when making unarmed attacks, and you inflict normal damage instead of subdual damage. You are considered armed with this hand. You cannot use that hand to cast spells, but can otherwise use the hand normally. Your hand's enhancement bonus does not apply to melee touch attacks.
Land Womb														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid,Ranger=4											SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:You and one other creature/level															DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.104				DESC:You descend into a protective bubble in the earth below where you were standing. Spectators around you see you descend into the ground as if the earth opened up and swallowed you. You cannot enter the land womb through stone or rock, only through tillable soil. The land womb holds you secure 10 feet below the surface. Anyone in a land womb cannot be perceived by divination spells of 4th level or lower. You may bring one additional creature per caster level with you into the land womb. All creatures to be brought into the land womb must be touching each other (for instance, in a ring of hands). You can breathe in the land womb, though the tightness of the space constricts you enough that you cannot cast spells with somatic components. You can, however, speak to anyone who accompanied you. You can no longer hear or see anything on the surface via nonmagical means. You can end the spell at will, but those who are with you cannot. At the end of the spell's duration, all within the land womb return to the spot where they stood before the spell took effect.
Launch Bolt														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=0										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One crossbow bolt in your possession															DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.105				DESC:You cast this spell on a crossbow bolt, causing it to fly at a target of your choice as if you had fired it from a light crossbow. Any properties of the bolt (such as magical abilities, masterwork quality, and so on) or feats you possess (such as Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus [light crossbow], and so on) apply.
Launch Item														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:One Fine item in your possession, weighting up to 10 lb											DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.105				DESC:You cause a Fine item in your possession to fly at great speed to a target or location you specify. The spell protects the item from any damage caused by this launching (for example, an egg would not crack from being hurled by the spell, a flask of alchemist's fire would not break from the sudden acceleration) but does not protect it from damage caused by striking the target. This spell is normally used to launch dangerous items (flasks of acid, thunderstones, and so on) farther than you could normally throw them. Even strange magical effects (such as the glowing bead from a delayed blast fireball spell) can be safely launched by this spell.
Life Bolt														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One ray/2 levels																		DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.105				DESC:You draw forth some of your own life force to create a beam of positive energy that harms undead. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if it hits an undead creature, it deals 2d4 points of damage to it. Creating the beam deals you 1 hit point of damage. For every two levels of experience past 1st, you can create an additional ray, up to a maximum of five rays at 9th level. If you shoot multiple rays, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. You must designate targets before you roll spell resistance or damage. All rays must be aimed at enemies that are all within 30 feet of each other.

You must notice the prints normally with a successful Search or Wilderness Lore check, but this spell eliminates any penalties to your tracking due to the passage of time or any rainfall since the making of the trail. This spell has no effect on tracks more than thirty days old.
Low-Light Vision													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Assassin,Harper Scout,Hathran,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=1				SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.106				DESC:You give the subject creature low-light vision, the ability to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.

The spell also prevents them from being magically compelled to harm you or anyone else affected by this spell. Any attempt to make a subject do so (whether the originating effect occurred before or after this spell was cast) counts as a suicidal order, triggering appropriate responses and possibly ending the controlling spell. If a subject willingly attempts to harm you, the spell is broken for that creature immediately. The subjects gain the benefits of a bless spell as long as you are in sight of them.

When used against a creature, you must make a melee touch attack against the target. If it hits, the mace of Odo deals 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Undead creatures take an additional +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +10). A creature struck by the mace must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round. While you are holding the mace, if you are targeted with a spell, you may choose to have the mace absorb that spell. The mace occupies your hand but (unlike holding the charge for a touch spell) does not disappear if you cast another spell. When the mace strikes a creature, is used to absorb a spell, or is removed from your grasp, it vanishes. The point in space where it vanished from glows as a light spell for the remainder of the duration.

As a move-equivalent action, you can move the target up to 20 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell's range. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. The target can be moved vertically, horizontally, or both. It cannot be moved beyond your range. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks (DC set by the DM).

The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 60 feet from the nearest other member of the group. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its camouflage. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 60 feet.

You can fly at a speed of 90 feet (60 feet if you're wearing medium or heavy armor). You can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed. You have a maneuverability of Good. Using master air requires as much concentration as walking, so you can attack or cast spells normally. You can charge but not run, and you cannot carry aloft more weight than your maximum load (see Carrying Capacity, page 141 of the Player's Handbook), plus any armor you wear. Should the spell duration expire while you are still aloft, the magic fails slowly. You drop 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If you reach the ground in that amount of time, you land safely. If not, you fall the rest of the distance, taking falling damage of 1d6 per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, you also fall in this way if the master air spell is dispelled. Focus: A wing feather from any bird or the wing bone of any bat.
Master Earth													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=7												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.107				DESC:You travel straight through the earth itself to a destination you choose. The movement is instantaneous and has no distance limitations (though the location must be on the same world). You need only think of where you want to go. If you don't think of an exact location, the earth carries you to the periphery of the general area you imagine. For example, if you want to go to the Shining Plains but you can't remember any specific landmarks, the earth brings you back on the surface at the nearest edge of the Shining Plains. The earth never leaves you stranded inside it. It always puts you back on the surface even if it cannot deliver you to your chosen destination. It takes you as far as it can. Underground, creature- built structures don't hinder you as long as you can move around them. This spell only functions on the Material Plane. Focus: The fossil of any animal.

This field of energy has the following effects on anything that touches or enters it: First, all creatures except you take 1 point of force damage per caster level. Spell resistance applies to the damage (but not the other effects of the spell). Those affected by the spell make a Will saving throw every round. A successful saving throw halves the damage that round. Second, the chaotic energy makes it difficult to concentrate. Any activity that requires concentration (such as casting a spell or using a spell-like ability) requires a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to succeed. Creatures with the chaotic subtype take no damage from this spell, although its other effects affect them normally. Material Component: A jawbone with teeth.

The spores permanently drain 1d6 points of Intelligence immediately. Each round thereafter, the spores gradually eat away at the subject's brain, permanently draining 1 additional point of Intelligence. The subject may roll a Fortitude save each round to combat the effects of the spores. A successful save ends the spores' advance and halts any further loss of Intelligence. Mestil's Acid Breath	DESC:You breathe forth a cone of acidic droplets. The cone inflicts 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Material Component: A handful of fire ants (alive or dead).
Mestil's Acid Sheath												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Acid														COMPS:V, S, M, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.108				DESC:You enclose yourself in a fluid sheath of acid that does not harm you. You can breathe normally and cast spells while the acid sheath is present. Any creature striking you with its body deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points +2 points per caster level of acid damage. Weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. The acid sheath does not protect you against other attack forms, such as fire. Any creature you are riding automatically takes damage every round as if you were touching it with a corrosive grasp. The mount tries to remove the source of pain, requiring a Ride check (DC 30) each round for you to remain mounted. You may make melee touch attacks as if you were using a corrosive grasp spell. A creature that swallows you does not take damage from this spell if its stomach inflicts acid damage. Material Component: A handful of fire ants (alive or dead). Focus: A glass sculpture of a humanoid.

Attacks against the creature except fire and acid inflict subdual damage instead of lethal damage. It heals subdual damage at a rate of 4 points per round. A regenerating creature that has been rendered unconscious through subdual damage can be killed with a coup de grace. The attack has to inflict fire or acid damage. Attack forms that don't inflict hit point damage (for example, most poisons and disintegration) ignore regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. A regenerating creature can regrow lost portions of its body (although the spell duration is usually not long enough to allow this except for very small portions such as fingers) and can reattach severed limbs as a move-equivalent action. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally. When the spell ends, all the creature's subdual damage is converted to normal damage.
Murderous Mist													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=4												SCHOOL:Evocation																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Cloud that spreads in 30-ft. radius, 20 ft. high													DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Reflex half (see text)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.109				DESC:You create a cloud of scalding hot steam that moves in a straight line, away from you, at a speed of 10 feet. Anyone within the cloud suffers 2d6 points of damage and is permanently blinded. If a creature within the area makes a successful Reflex saving throw, it takes only half damage and is not blinded. Creatures remaining within the cloud suffer 1d6 points of damage in each subsequent round of exposure. Creatures may attempt saving throws each round they are within the cloud to avoid its effects. Any creature within the cloud has one-quarter concealment. Winds do not affect the cloud's direction or speed. However, a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (21+) disperses it in 1 round.
Mystic Lash														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=3[PREDEITY:1,Bane]									SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Electricity|Evil												COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:0 ft.					TARGETAREA:Electric whip																		DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (see text)		SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.109				DESC:You create a long whip of ghostly red energy that emanates from your hand and never harms you. You wield this weapon as if it were an actual whip and you were proficient with it. Attacks with the mystic lash are ranged touch attacks. The lash deals 1d8 points of electrical damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +5). Since the lash is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A creature hit with the lash must make a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the lash hits its target, you may release it from your hand so that it continues to attack that target automatically, leaving your hand free. The lash attacks using your base attack value, although it can only attack once per round on its own. If the lash's target falls unconscious, dies, or is destroyed, the lash returns to you on its next action. If you do not grasp the lash on the round it returns, it dissipates, but otherwise you can use the lash on another creature and begin the cycle again.

You suffer a penalty of 1d4+1 points to any single ability score of your choice, and your target gains an equal enhancement bonus to the same ability score. (You don't get a saving throw to avoid the loss.) If you cast this spell a second time within 1 hour, you suffer 2d10 points of damage.

The net does not hamper movement, but a creature enfolded in a net cannot see beyond 5 feet, even with darkvision. The folds of a net hide the creature within it, giving the creature nine-tenths concealment (attacks suffer a 40%% miss chance). The net also hampers the enfolded subject's own attacks, granting ninetenths concealment to creatures within 5 feet and total concealment to creatures more than 5 feet away.
Nightmare Lullaby													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=2												SCHOOL:Enchantment				SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting|Sonic											COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:Concentration + 2 rounds				SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.110				DESC:You put your target into a surreal, sleepwalking state.

The Red Wizards now employ it mainly as a combat spell. The subject receives a sharp, agonizing pain, which makes him dazed (no actions, but can defend against attacks normally) for 1 round. The subject suffers a -1 penalty on attacks, saving throws, and most checks while the spell lasts; however, the subject also receives a +2 circumstance bonus to Strength. Focus: A stick at least 1 foot long.

The subject is dazed for 1d4 rounds and suffers a -2 penalty on attacks, saving throws, and most checks while the spell lasts; however, the subject also receives a +2 circumstance bonus to Strength. Focus: A pointed stick at least 1 foot long.

The target creature must make a Fortitude save or die instantly. A surviving creature receives a Will save to avoid further effects. Subjects failing the Will save are dazed for 1d4 rounds and suffer a -2 penalty on attacks, saving throws, and most checks while the spell lasts; however, the subject also receives a +2 circumstance bonus to Strength. Focus: A pointed metal rod at least 1 foot long.

It causes wracking pain and violent convulsions. The target creature must make a Fortitude save or die instantly. A surviving creature receives a Will save to avoid further effects. Subjects failing the Will save are dazed and suffer a -4 penalty on saving throws for the duration of the spell. Focus: A whip.

A successful Fortitude save is required only upon the first entry into the area of effect (and again 1 minute later); creatures don't have to save each time they enter (or each round they remain within). You are immune to the poison of the vines you create, and you can select a number of other targets equal to your level to share this immunity.
Prismatic Eye													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Evocation																									COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:Magical eye																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.112				DESC:You create a visible orb that can fire various ray effects. The eye can be moved up to your speed as a move-equivalent action but cannot go beyond the spell's range. Starting on the round it appears, you can command the eye to fire a ray as a free action once per round. The ray is a ranged touch attack with a +6 attack bonus and a range of 50 feet. If struck, the target suffers the effect of one of the beams of a prismatic spray spell (roll randomly, rerolling 8s). Once a particular color ray has been used, it is no longer available to the eye. Once all seven rays are used, the eye remains and can be moved by you but has no other abilities. The eye is AC 18 (+8 size) and has 9 hit points. It saves as you. Focus: A polished rainbow-hued abalone shell.
Puppeteer														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=3												SCHOOL:Enchantment				SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion																	COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.112				DESC:You force your subject to mimic your actions. Your subject matches your motions exactly, though she suffers a -4 penalty to Dexterity and Strength. She looks awkward, and her actions aren't as effective as if she were actually doing them herself. You can make the subject commit a suicidal act, but she receives another Will save to break the spell. If successful, she collapses, helpless in a comatose state, for 1d4 rounds. Controlling the subject requires concentration. If your concentration is ever interrupted, you may resume control of the subject as a free action on your turn. Anyone observing the subject of this spell can determine that the subject's actions are being controlled with a Sense Motive check (DC 15, or DC 10 if the controlling bard is also visible). This spell doesn't grant the subject extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like abilities, or spellcasting abilities, even if you have and use such abilities during the spell's duration.
Quillfire														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=3												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.112				DESC:Your hand sprouts poisonous quills that you can use in melee or as a ranged attack. The quills inflict 1d8 points of damage +1 point/2 levels (maximum +5). They may be thrown as a group using a single ranged attack roll (range increment 10 feet). The quills are poisonous (injury DC 18, 1d6 Str/1d6 Str).

Your hands harden until they are similar to a ram's horn in texture and hardness. Your unarmed attacks inflict normal (not subdual) damage. You are considered armed. The hardness has no other effect; you can cast spells and manipulate objects normally.
Remedy Moderate Wounds												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=2|Cleric=3										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Healing																		COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																	DURATION:10 rounds + 1 round/2 levels			SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.113				DESC:When laying your hand upon a living creature, you boost its life energy to grant it the fast healing ability. The target heals 2 hit points per round until the duration expires. This spell does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a creature to regrow or attach lost body parts. The effect of the spell automatically stabilizes a dying character. The effects of multiple remedy spells do not stack; only the highest-level effect applies. Applying a second remedy spell of equal level extends the spell's duration.
Reveille														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=3												SCHOOL:Necromancy									DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent|Sonic											COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One recently dead creature																DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.113				DESC:You cause a recently dead creature (within three days of its death) to reveal information about events that led up to its death. The corpse speaks tersely in its native language, using no more than a dozen words or so in a round. In the first round, it describes the last thing it saw. In the second, it describes its dying wish. In the third, it describes the wounding that killed it. In the fourth, it tells who killed it. In the fifth, it tells why it believes it was killed. In the sixth and all rounds following, it answers one question to the best of its ability (as speak with dead). The corpse has no more knowledge than it had when alive, nor does it retain any memory of events that occurred after its death. All restrictions placed on the use of speak with dead (differing alignments allow a saving throw, no repeat uses of this spell or speak with dead within seven days, intact body required, and undead creatures are immune) apply to this spell as well.
Revenance														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Paladin=4|Bard=5	CLASSES:Cleric=4[PREDEITY:1,Jergal]				SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Healing																		COMPS:V, S, M, DF			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Dead ally touched																		DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None (see text)				SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.113				DESC:You touch a recently slain ally and temporarily restore the character to life so he may continue to fight. The target can have been dead for up to 1 round/caster level. He functions as if a raise dead spell had been cast upon him, except that she does not lose a level and has half of his normal hit points. He is alive (not undead) for the duration of the spell and can be healed normally, but dies as soon as the spell ends. While the subject is under this spell, he is not affected by resurrection or raise dead. The target gains a +1 morale bonus on attacks, damage, saves, and checks against the creature that killed him. Material Component: 500 gp of diamond dust sprinkled over the body.
Reverse Arrows													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:10 minutes/level or until discharged		SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.114				DESC:As protection from arrows, except that if any missile that strikes you has all its damage negated by your damage reduction (10/+1), the missile is turned back upon its target. The attacker's attack roll is used to determine if the reversed ranged weapon strikes the attacker, but the damage is rerolled. If the attacker is also protected by a reverse arrows spell, it is possible that the ranged weapon would bounce between them each round until one of the spells is discharged from accumulated damage. The damage reduction increases with the caster level to 10/+2 at 10th, 10/+3 at 15th, and 10/+5 at 20th. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged. Focus: A piece of shell from a tortoise, and a ball of tree sap.
Righteous Fury													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=3												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.114				DESC:Summoning the power of your deity, you charge yourself with positive energy. This gives you 1d4 temporary hit points per caster level (maximum 10d4), a +2 natural armor bonus, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and a +2 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves. Any undead creature striking you with its body deals you normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1 point of damage from the positive energy, as if from a cure minor wounds spell.
Rosemantle														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=1[PREDEITY:1,Lathander]								SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.114				DESC:You cause the target to glow with a soft, faint, rosy radiance equal to candlelight. This glow protects the target against effects that work by directly causing pain (such as Nybor's gentle reminder), nausea, and fear effects by granting a +1 sacred bonus per caster level (up to +10) on saving throws against those spells and effects. The target also becomes temporarily immune to poison (as the delay poison spell). This spell only suppresses these effects, not negates them, so the effects resume when this spell expires.
Safe Clearing													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=3												SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:30-ft radius spread																	DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.114				DESC:You make an area safe from attacks. This spell functions much like the sanctuary spell. Anyone attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack anyone within the safe clearing, or anyone attempting to enter the area, must make a Will save. Success means the creature may act normally and is not affected by this casting of the spell. Failure means it can't attack anyone in the area or even enter the area for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent creatures in the warded area from being attacked or affected by area effect spells. Those in the safe clearing (even those unaffected by the spell) cannot attack without breaking the spell, but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act. Once the spell is cast, the area protected by safe clearing is immobile.
Scent															TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=2								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.115				DESC:You give the target an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of some monsters. This ability allows the creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When a creature detects a scent, the exact location is not revealed-only its presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a partial action to note the direction of the scent. If it moves within 5 feet of the source, the creature can pinpoint that source. A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on the strength of the quarry's odor, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility. Arcane Material Components:A sprinkle of mustard and pepper, and a drop of sweat.
Scintillating Sphere												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Electricity													COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:20-ft radius spread																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes																		PREREGION:1,Halruaa	SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.115				DESC:As fireball, except as noted above and that the spell deals electricity damage.

Shadow Hand														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Shadow																		COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:5-ft hand																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.115				DESC:You create a floating Medium-size hand out of shadow material. The shadow hand is an opaque gray color, 5 feet long, and that wide with its fingers outstretched. It can give cover as a Bigby's interposing hand spell (providing only one-half cover), carry materials as Tenser's floating disk, strike opponents, or point or gesture as a normal hand does. The hand is AC 18 (+6 natural, +2 deflection) and has half as many hit points as you have when undamaged. It can be damaged just as Bigby's interposing hand can, and makes all saving throws as if it were you. Changing the hand's task or target is a standard action, and it can move anywhere in range. If not given any commands, the hand follows you at your speed, maintaining the same distance from you. The spell ends if the hand ever exceeds its range. If it is carrying items and commanded to do something else, the hand drops whatever it is holding in order to complete its task (you can order the hand to rid itself of items gently as a standard action). Unlike Tenser's floating disk, it does not have to follow you at a fixed distance- you may direct where the hand goes. If commanded to attack, the hand makes a slam attack at your base attack bonus (+4 for its 18 Strength), dealing 1d6+4 points of damage, attacking from your direction. It cannot perform any special combat actions such as bull rush, grapple, or trip.
Shadow Well														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Shadow																		COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.116				DESC:You cause the target's shadow to become a temporary gateway to a pocket realm within the Plane of Shadow. The target must make a Will save or be pulled into the gateway; inside the pocket realm he sees a deserted, gloomy duplicate of the real world, while shadowy phantasms stalk and taunt him without causing actual harm. When the duration ends, the victim returns to the real world and suffers a secondary fear effect. The victim is frightened for 1d4 rounds and must flee. On leaving the pocket realm, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the shadow well spell was cast. If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject appears nearby. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a shadow well spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell as normal (but the target is still frightened upon leaving).
Share Husk														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=2												SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Animal touched																		DURATION:Concentration						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.116				DESC:You sense through an animal's senses, seeing through its eyes, smelling through its nose, and hearing through its ears. You use the animal's Listen and Spot skill modifiers instead of your own. This spell gives you no special ability to understand what you sense. You can switch your perceptions between the animal and your own on your turn as a free action. You and the animal must be on the same plane for the spell to function. Material Component: An edible treat that would appeal to the animal (vegetable or meat).
Shatterfloor													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:15-ft-radius spread																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will half					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.116				DESC:You create a loud, thrumming vibration that builds to a painful crescendo before fading. Creatures and objects in the area take 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and can make a Will saving throw for half damage. If the floor of the area is made of stone, wood, ice, or material any softer than those, the floor is pulverized to a depth of 6 inches, resulting in an area of soft dust, wood fragments, or loose crushed ice, as appropriate. Any creature moving across this surface is reduced to half speed. Focus: A miniature hammer and bell.
Shelgarn's Persistent Blade											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Force														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One small blade																		DURATION:1 round/2 levels					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.117				DESC:You bring into being a tiny blade of force. The blade flies at a speed of 40 feet and attacks any target within its range, as you desire, starting the round that you cast the spell. The blade attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to half your Charisma or Intelligence modifier (for sorcerers and wizards, respectively) and dealing damage as a dagger (including the threat range and critical multiplier). If an ally also attacks the creature, the blade moves on your turn to flank the target. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. The blade is AC 14 (+2 size, +2 Dex) and has 1 hit point. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the blade to a new target; otherwise it continues to attack the same target. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time Shelgarn's persistent blade strikes. If the blade is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the blade has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. Focus: A silvered dagger.
Shroud of Undeath													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2										SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.117				DESC:You shroud yourself with invisible negative energy so that nonintelligent undead perceive you as a fellow undead creature, ignoring you. Your appearance does not change, and while intelligent undead do not immediately recognize you as alive, they are likely to question whether you are actually undead. If used in conjunction with a disguise or an illusion to appear undead, this spell gives you a +5 bonus on your Disguise check. If you attack an undead creature while this spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends. When using this spell, inflict spells heal you and cure spells hurt you. You are treated as if you were undead for the purpose of all spells and effects. A successful turn (or rebuke) attempt against an undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be panicked (or cowering) for 10 rounds. A turn attempt that would destroy (or command) undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will save (DC 15 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be stunned (or charmed as with charm monster) for 10 rounds. Material Component: Dust or bone fragments from any destroyed undead creature.
Silent Portal													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=0|Assassin=1								SCHOOL:Illusion																									COMPS:S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Any single portal																		DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.117				DESC:This simple cantrip negates the sound of opening and closing a single portal (door, window, gate, drawer, chest lid, and so on). Even the squeakiest door opens without a sound when under the effect of this spell. Silent portal covers only normal means of opening and closing the targeted portal. Breaking a window or kicking a door in still makes noise, but opening a door that is falling off its hinges does not (since this is the normal way a door would open). Portals composed of magical energy are not affected by this spell. In the case of magic or even intelligent portals, spell resistance and a Will save (DC 10 + caster's ability score modifier + other modifiers as appropriate) apply.
Silverbeard														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, DF				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:Personal																			DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No													PREDEITY:1,Clangeddin Silverbeard					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.117				DESC:Your beard grows and turns to pure and magically hardened silver, increasing the armor bonus of your armor by +2. An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants an AC bonus for the purpose of this spell. If you do not have a beard, you grow one for the duration of this spell (even if you are a creature that cannot normally grow a beard, such as an elf or a female human). You get a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against dwarves. Repeated uses of this spell eventually result in your beard turning a natural silver color (if you cannot normally grow a beard, this secondary effect does not occur).
Simbul's Skeletal Deliquescence										TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 day/level						SAVEINFO:Fort negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.118				DESC:You turn the bones and hard tissue of the subject to mush, making him a strange sort of oozelike creature. He immediately collapses into a heap, lacking the ability to maintain his previous shape. His Dexterity becomes 1, his speed becomes Swim 10 ft., and he loses the ability to attack, speak, carry objects, or cast spells with somatic components. He can still use spelllike and supernatural abilities. He cannot be flanked and is immune to critical hits. His equipment is not affected. This spell is normally used as a punishment or to disable opponents without killing them.
Simbul's Spell Matrix												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:Up to four of your spells																DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)																																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.118				DESC:You prepare a magical matrix that allows you to store up to four spells of up to 3rd level that you can cast individually as free actions. You cast Simbul's spell matrix, and each round thereafter cast one of the spells to be stored in the matrix (the matrix closes after the fourth round and no more spells can be added, even if it is not full). Only spells that can be altered by the Quicken Spell feat can be placed in the matrix. Each spell placed in the matrix deals 1d6 points of damage to you, and this damage cannot be healed by any means while the matrix exists. While the matrix spell is active, you can cast any of the spells stored in it once as a free action. This counts as casting a quickened spell, so you cannot activate a matrix spell and cast a nonmatrix quickened spell in the same round. Once a spell is cast from the matrix, it is gone. Any spell in the matrix is treated as a prepared spell for dealing with effects that affect prepared spells. A dispel magic spell that successfully dispels the matrix dispels all the spells in the matrix. An antimagic field suspends the matrix but does not cause the first spell to fire (the matrix becomes active again when you are out of the antimagic field). If you die, all spells in the matrix dissipate harmlessly. Focus: A piece of amber with a minimum value of 500 gp.
Simbul's Spell Sequencer											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7										SCHOOL:Transmutation																																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.118				DESC:As Simbul's spell matrix, except that spells of up to 5th level may be placed in the matrix. In addition, you may decide to link two or more of the matrixed spells into a spell sequence. Spells to be linked into a sequence must be of 2nd level or lower. You may discharge all the spells linked into a single sequence with a free action, just as if you were casting one spell out of the Simbul's spell matrix. Focus: A sapphire with a minimum value of 1,000 gp.
Simbul's Spell Trigger												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9										SCHOOL:Transmutation																																																																																																												SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.118				DESC:As Simbul's spell sequencer, except that the spells to be held in the matrix may be as high as 7th level, and you may create a spell sequence of spells of 4th level or less. In addition, you may designate one spell or one spell sequence held in the matrix to come into effect under a condition you dictate when casting Simbul's spell trigger. This function works much like a contingency spell. The spell (or sequence of spells) to be brought into effect by the triggering condition must be of a type that affect your person, such as feather fall or levitate. The conditions needed to bring the matrix spells into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, Simbul's spell trigger immediately brings into effect the designated spell (or sequence of spells), which are "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. You cannot choose to have the spell or spells not come into effect when the triggering event occurs. Focus: A diamond with a minimum value of 1,500 gp.
Simbul's Synostodweomer												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:One of your spell																		DURATION:1 round							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.119				DESC:You channel the spell energy from a spell you know into healing magic. After you cast this spell, on your next turn you cast another spell, which is converted to positive energy. On the round you cast the second spell, you may touch yourself or another creature, curing 1d6 hit points of damage for every spell level of the spell you cast. If the spell you cast was prepared with a metamagic feat, you use the level of the spell slot the spell occupied.
Skeletal Guard													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8										SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One or more finger bones																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.119				DESC:You create a number of loyal skeletons from finger bones. All skeletons are Medium-size with the normal Monster Manual statistics for their kind, except their effective Hit Dice as far as turning is concerned is equal to your class level. These skeletons count toward the number of Hit Dice of undead you can have in your control. You can create one skeleton per caster level. Unlike the animate dead spell, these skeletons try to remain within 60 feet of you. If you exceed this range, they become inert until you return. Material Components:One finger bone and one onyx gem worth 50 gp per skeleton to be created. If the finger bones come from a Medium-size creature, the skeleton that forms from that finger bone is that type of creature.
Skull of Secrets													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=4[PREDEITY:1,Cyric]									SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Shadow																		COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Intangible skull																		DURATION:Permanent until discharged				SAVEINFO:Reflex half (see text)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.119				DESC:You create an intangible image of a floating skull that trails black flames. The skull and its flames are obviously an illusion and cause no damage, nor can the skull be damaged by attacks. The skull flies at speed 40 feet (Perfect) but cannot move more than 20 feet from its point of origin. The skull floats about aimlessly but threateningly within its available range. You set two triggering conditions for the skull. The first activates a message as if the skull were a magic mouth. The second causes the skull to spit a tongue of flame 5 feet wide and 10 feet long that deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the creature that triggered it. Those affected can make Reflex saving throws for half damage. The triggering conditions can be the same for both effects, which would cause the skull to spit flame and speak its message at the same time. Once both triggering conditions have been met, the skull disappears. The skull can only do each effect one time, so if it has already spoken its message, it does not speak it again if the message trigger occurs a second time.
Smell of Fear													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.119				DESC:You bestow your target with an aroma that attracts predators. The smell triples the chance of encountering wandering monsters in the area. Attracted creatures won't necessarily attack the target to the exclusion of others; they're just attracted to the area.
Snakebite														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=3|Ranger=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.120				DESC:One of your arms turns into a venomous snake with a fanged, biting mouth. The bite does 1d3 points of damage and carries a toxic venom (1d6 Con/1d6 Con). Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half caster level + caster's Wisdom modifier). If the victim fails either save, he must also make a Will save (DC as normal for spell) or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. You can't hold a weapon with your transformed hand, but your other hand can be used to wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components. Attacking with the transformed hand and a weapon incurs the standard two-weapon fighting penalties (see Table 8-2: Two- Weapon Fighting Penalties, page 125 of the Player's Handbook). You can only be under the effect of one snakebite spell at any given time.
Songbird														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=0												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:Performance + 1 hour or until discharged	SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.120				DESC:You acquire an even greater Charisma when you perform. Anyone who hears or views your performance becomes favorably inclined toward you. This spell grants you a +1 competence bonus on your next Charisma check to influence an NPC's attitude (for details, see NPC Attitudes, page 149 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide) or Charismabased skill check against any one person who saw the performance. This effect lasts for the duration of the performance and up to 1 hour immediately following. You must begin the performance within 1 hour of casting the spell for it to have any effect.
Spectral Stag													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=2[PREDEITY:1,Malar]									SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation																	COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:0 ft.					TARGETAREA:One quasi-real staglike creature															DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.120				DESC:You conjure a quasi-real, staglike creature. The creature can either be directed to attack a target or simply carry you on its back. When you cast the spell, you decide if you want the stag to appear next to you or form underneath you so you may ride it immediately. The stag has a speed of 60 feet and can act as soon as it appears. It moves as you direct. Controlling the stag is a free action. The stag can ride in the air as if it were firm land, as a phantom steed spell cast by a 12th-level caster. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level. The mount has an Armor Class of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the spectral stag disappears. If directed to attack a creature, the stag charges its target and initiates a bull rush. The stag is Large and has Strength 18 for this purpose. The stag cannot be attacked or damaged, but if you are riding it when it attempts a bull rush, the defender may use her attack of opportunity against you instead of against the stag. If the bull rush fails, the stag (and you, if riding it) moves 5 feet straight back to where it was before it moved into the target's space. If the bull rush succeeds, the stag moves the defender the maximum distance possible. The defender also must make a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. When the spell ends, the stag vanishes. If you were riding the stag, you land safely on the ground.
Speechlink														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=4												SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:You and one creature touched																DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.121				DESC:You and a willing target can communicate no matter how much distance you put between yourselves on the same plane. Either participant may end the spell at any time. Speechlink allows each listener to hear only the other's vocalizations, though they may be of any volume. It does not transfer sounds from the other participant's location. This spell works on any creature, including animals, but does not convey any special language comprehension abilities.
Speed Swim														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard=1								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature																			DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.121				DESC:You give the subject creature the ability to swim at speed 30 feet (ignoring the effects of armor and encumbrance) without having to make Swim checks. He gets a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. He can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened when swimming. He can use the run action while swimming, provided he swims in a straight line. Focus: A miniature wooden paddle.
Spell Engine													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8										SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, M, XP			CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:5-ft radius magical wheel																DURATION:See text							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.121				DESC:You create a disk of magical energy 10 feet in diameter and 2 feet thick. The disk is incorporeal and invisible when first created. Whenever a spell is cast or a spell-like ability is used within the 10-foot diameter of the spell engine, it activates, absorbs the magical energy, and begins to glow and spin, providing light as a torch. The spell engine similarly absorbs most spell effects targeted at it. It absorbs all these effects as if it were a rod of absorption with an unlimited capacity. Over time (1 hour per spell level absorbed) the engine slows to a stop and becomes dim and translucent, but it remains capable of absorbing magical energy indefinitely. If an activated spell engine comes in contact with any permanent (noncharged or single-use) magic item, it destroys the item and explodes for 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all creatures in range, destroying itself in the process. Magic already in place when the spell engine is created (such as a glyph of warding) or carried into its area (such as an invisibility spell on a creature) are not absorbed unless they are somehow directed against the spell engine (such as an antimagic field pressed against it). A spell engine absorbs any dispel magic spell directed at it. A detect magic spell cast outside the spell engine's range detects it normally. A disintegrate spell causes the spell engine to explode as if it had contacted a magic item. Preparing spells within the light provided by a spell engine takes only half as long as normal. Material Components: A disk of polished bone, one of your tears, and a silver wheel worth 1,000 gp. XP Cost: 250 XP.
Spell Enhancer													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V				CASTTIME:See text								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:One of your spells																		DURATION:1 round																																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.121				DESC:This spell enhances the next spell you cast, making it more difficult for targets to resist. Casting spell enhancer is a free action, allowing you to cast the spell to be enhanced in the same round as this spell. The saving throw DC of the enhanced spell is increased by +2.
Spellmantle														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=6[PREDEITY:1,Mystra]									SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.122				DESC:You protect the subject with a magical aura that protects it against one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower and not spells delivered by a touch attack. When the subject of the spellmantle is the target of or within the area of one of the spells it protects against, the mantle absorbs the spell's energy completely. The subject can then direct this energy to one of two purposes: Healing: The target immediately receives a cure spell of the level of the spell that was absorbed. The cure spell functions as if you had cast it upon the target. If the target is unconscious the spell automatically converts to a cure spell without her choice. Receive Spell: The energy can immediately trigger a spell upon the target. You designate the spell when you cast the spellmantle, and it must be a spell of 4th level or lower that you have prepared at the time of casting. This does not cause you to lose the prepared spell. If the level of the incoming spell is lower than that of your designated spell, the target cannot activate this affect. Your designated spell functions as if you had cast it upon the target. The duration of this triggered spell can outlast the spellmantle itself. For example, you can designate lightning bolt as one of the spells the spellmantle absorbs and choose magic circle against evil to be the spell the subject receives, so every time she is in the area of a lightning bolt (or any of the other spells that you designate for this spell), she is immediately protected by magic circle against evil. The spellmantle can absorb 1d4 spell levels +1 per four levels (maximum 1d4+5), after which it dissipates. If the spellmantle lacks sufficient capacity to absorb a spell, the spellmantle has no effect.
Spell Phylactery													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=5[PREDEITY:1,Mystra]									SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Scroll touched																		DURATION:Permanent until triggered				SAVEINFO:None (object)					SPELLRES:Yes (object)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.122				DESC:You create a set of triggering conditions for the targeted scroll so that if these conditions are met, the spell on the scroll is cast upon you as if you were spending a standard action to cast the scroll yourself. If the scroll contains a spell that is not on your spell list, it is not cast when the triggering condition occurs and the magic of the spell phylactery dissipates. Any limitations involved in your reading the scroll normally (such as a minimum ability score or requiring a caster level check) still apply, and if they are not met, the spell phylactery magic dissipates. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. For example, a spell phylactery with a scroll of water breathing might prescribe that any time you are plunged into or otherwise engulfed in water or similar liquid, the water breathing scroll instantly comes into effect. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the spell phylactery may fail when called on. The scroll is activated based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. The scroll prepared with this spell must be bound to your arm or forehead (usually rolled tightly or placed in a small box for this purpose) and counts as a bracer or headband in terms of space limitations for magic items. The spell on the scroll must be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 5th level). The spell on the scroll must be one that affects your person, and the triggering conditions must be clear as defined in the contingency spell. If another person wears the spell phylactery, the magic of this spell ends. You may remove and rewear the spell phylactery without penalty, but if 24 hours pass without your wearing it, the magic of the spell phylactery ends. The termination of this spell does not harm the spell on the scroll.
Spell Shield													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=2[PREDEITY:1,Mystra]									SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.122				DESC:The subject gains a +3 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities (but not against supernatural and extraordinary abilities).

The poison deals 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage immediately and another 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half caster level + caster's Intelligence or Charisma modifier, for wizards and sorcerers, respectively). Material Component: A poisonous spider, alive or dead.
Spirit Worm														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Living creature touched																	DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Fort partial					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.123				DESC:You create a lingering decay in the spirit and body of the target. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1 point of temporary Constitution damage each round while the spell lasts (maximum 5 points of Constitution). If it makes its save, it does not lose any Constitution but takes 1d2 points of damage each round while the spell lasts (maximum 5d2). The damage remains after the spell ends. Material Component: A piece of fire-blackened ivory or bone carved in the shape of a segmented worm.
Stalking Brand													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 day/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.123				DESC:Your touch marks your target with a tiny symbol visible only to you and to detect magic. The brand appears as you envision it, approximately an inch in diameter. You can still see the brand, even if the subject uses magical means to change or hide her appearance. Even spells such as change self, polymorph self, and invisibility do not hide the brand. To your eyes, the mark glows a light green.
Steeldance														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Evocation																									COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Two daggers																			DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.123				DESC:You cause two daggers in your possession to grow to the size and shape of longswords, which then attack creatures you specify. The blades have AC 14 (+1 size, +1 Dex, +2 natural), hardness 10, and 5 hit points. They fly at speed 30 feet (good maneuverability), deal 1d8 points of slashing damage, and score a threat of a critical on a natural 19 or 20. They are otherwise treated as Medium-size animated objects (as if animated by an animate objects spell). You can cast spells such as magic weapon on the daggers before or after the steeldance spell takes effect. Focus: Two daggers.
Stone Bones														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Corporeal undead creature touched															DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.123				DESC:You cause the skeleton of the target corporeal undead to become thicker and as strong as stone. This gives the target a +3 natural armor bonus to AC. It has no effect if the creature has no skeleton (such as an undead plant or octopus) but works normally on creatures that have exoskeletons (such as insects). Another version of this spell is rumored to exist that works on living creatures, but causes wracking pains because of the radical alteration of its skeleton. The other version has fallen out of use because few creatures willingly subject themselves to it (except perhaps worshipers of Loviatar). Arcane Focus: A miniature skull carved of granite.
Stonehold														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=6												SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Earth														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One 10-ft square/level																	DURATION:1 day/level						SAVEINFO:See text (object)				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.124				DESC:This spell conjures thick, stony arms that spring forth from a rock or stone formation whenever anyone passes near it. Each 10-foot square in the spell's area contains one stone arm. The arms attempt to grapple any creature that enters their area. Each arm has a Strength of 20 and a base attack bonus of +1/caster level (plus Strength bonus). The arms are Medium-size. Once an arm has grappled a target, it automatically inflicts 1d6+5 points of damage per round. An arm maintains its grapple until the subject escapes, even holding a victim long after death. Each arm has 1 hp/caster level, AC 18, and hardness 8, and saves as the caster. Before they attack, the arms remain beneath the surface of the stone. They may be discovered (but not disarmed) as a magic trap.
Stone Shatter													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=4												SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One stone object																		DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:See text (object)				SPELLRES:See Text																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.124				DESC:You aim a single note of perfect pitch toward a stone object or creature, causing it to shatter. The target object cannot weigh more than 2 pounds per caster level. Anyone within 5 feet of an exploding object suffers 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum 15 points). No saving throw applies to this effect. Targeted against a stone creature (of any weight), stone shatter deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.
Stone Walk														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=6[PREDEITY:1,Bane]									SCHOOL:Transmutation				SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation																	COMPS:V, S, M (see text)	CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Stone touched																		DURATION:Permanent until discharged				SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)			SPELLRES:Yes (object)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.124				DESC:You magically link one location to another so that you or another may speak a command word at one end and be teleported to the other end. Before you cast the spell, you must prepare the ends of the link, both of which must be areas of stone 5 feet square. This preparation takes 1 hour, and functions for repeated castings of the spell as long as the stones are not damaged. When the spell is cast, the stones become attuned to a command word you designate. Any creature that speaks the command word while standing upon one of the stones is teleported without error to the other end instantaneously. The stones function once for every four caster levels, and can carry 50 pounds per caster level each time. Creatures that exceed the weight limitation are not transported and count as one of the uses of the spell. Material Component: The preparation of each of the ends of the link requires a paste made from rubies and amber worth 2,500 gp. Casting the spell requires a 2,500 gp diamond. Activating one of the linked stones once the spell is cast does not require any material components.
Stormrage														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=8[PREDEITY:1,Talos]									SCHOOL:Transmutation								DESCRIPTOR:Electricity													COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 minute/level (D)																																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.125				DESC:You harness the powers of wind and storm to move, protect yourself, and attack. You gain the benefits of a fly spell and are protected from each direction as if surrounded by a wind wall spell. You are completely unaffected by natural or magical wind (such as a hurricane or a gust of wind spell), easily able to hold your position and completely unaffected by other adverse effects of extreme wind (such as having to make Concentration checks because of strong winds). Finally, you can discharge bolts of electricity from your eyes. Your caster level is the total number of d6 worth of bolts that you can create with this spell (maximum 20d6). You may use them all at once or divide the dice over several rounds. For example, a 16th-level caster can fire an 8d6 bolt on one round and another 8d6 bolt on the next, fire sixteen bolts over 16 or more rounds (each doing 1d6 electricity damage), or make one large bolt that deals 16d6. Each bolt affects only one creature. Any bolt, regardless of its damage, has a range of 100 feet. Launching a bolt is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity and requires a ranged touch attack (you gain a +3 attack bonus if the opponent is wearing metal armor, made out of metal, or carrying a lot of metal).
Storm Tower														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=7												SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:100-ft.-tall, 20-ft.-radius spread															DURATION:1 round/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.125				DESC:You form a tower of dark, swirling storm clouds that negates many forms of magic. The storm tower absorbs any electricity damage dealt to those within it. Magic missiles cannot be cast into, out of, or within the storm tower. The storm tower is treated as 60 mph winds (making ranged attacks impossible within the tower), though it has no effect on the movement of creatures within it. However, only Gargantuan or Colossal creatures can pass through the outer edge of the storm tower; all creatures of lesser size are checked at the edge. Anyone within the storm tower has one-half concealment relative to those outside the tower. The howling winds of the storm tower also apply a -10 penalty on all Listen checks within 50 feet of it (including all those inside).

The spell grants an enhancement bonus to Strength of 1d4+1 points, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier. The spell ends instantly if you ever lose contact with the ground. This means you cannot jump, tumble, charge, run, or move more than your speed in a round (because these acts cause both of your feet to leave the ground) without breaking the spell. A natural stone wall or ceiling counts as the ground for the purpose of this spell (so you could climb a cavern wall and not lose the spell).
Summon Undead I													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	DESCRIPTOR:see text													COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 full round							RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One summoned creature																	DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.125				DESC:As summon monster I, except that you summon an undead creature. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the Summon Undead table below. You choose which creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. Summoned undead do not count toward your total Hit Dice of undead you can control with animate dead or clerical negative energy. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. Focus: A tiny bag, a small (not lit) candle, and a carved bone from any humanoid.

Magical writing such as a glyph of warding, explosive runes, sepia snake sigil, or symbol is covered by a blue nimbus of light (which sheds light equal to a candle). This reveals the location of the writing but prevents it from being triggered. You and other creatures could read a book warded by explosive runes, or open a drawer guarded by a glyph of warding, or pass through a doorway protected by a symbol without effect. This spell covers and negates any active or triggered magical writing (such as a quickly scribed symbol of fear or a triggered symbol of death), although creatures that have already succumbed to the effects of the writing are unaffected. Once this spell ends, all magical writing in the area can be triggered normally, and active or triggered writings resume their function if they have any duration left.

#Symbol.MOD																																																																																																																																															SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.127				DESC:This spell allows you to scribe any one of several potent runes. Two new symbols are described below; the others appear in the symbol spell description in the Player's Handbook. Death Symbol of Bane: This type of symbol was created by the worshipers of Bane and lost until that dark deity was reborn in 1372 DR. A death symbol of Bane is always carefully engraved and never quickly scribed. It is triggered as you designate, within the guidelines of the symbol spell. However, a person wearing a holy symbol of Bane never triggers the spell. A death symbol of Bane functions exactly like a symbol of death, except that any creatures within 60 feet of the death symbol of Bane that survive must make two more Fortitude saves, the first to avoid taking 1d12 points of cold damage and the second to avoid the effects of a doom spell. This version of the symbol spell has the death and evil descriptors. Material Component: A paste made from the symbol spell's material components and the blood of intelligent sacrificed creatures (minimum 3 Intelligence) whose Hit Dice total at least 30 that have been killed within the past year. Once a creature's blood is used for this spell, that same creature's blood cannot be used in the material component for another death symbol of Bane. Symbol of Spell Loss: This is another variant of the symbol spell. When triggered, the symbol of spell loss begins to attack the minds of spellcasters within 60 feet. Each caster must attempt a Will saving throw every round he or she is in this area. Failure means that the highest-level spell prepared by the spellcaster (or highestlevel spell slot, if the character casts spells like a sorcerer or bard) is lost. The symbol remains until it has erased 30 levels of spells. The symbol attacks creatures with spelllike abilities as if they had spells. It has no effect on creatures without spells or spell-like abilities. This version of the symbol spell is a mind-affecting spell.

These spheres provide as much light as a dancing lights spell and can be used offensively or defensively. Each sphere corresponds to one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic). On your turn you can direct one or more spheres to strike a creature or creatures in range, no two of which may be more than 30 feet apart. Each sphere inflicts 1d4 points of energy damage per four caster levels (max 4d4 each) to a single creature, so an 8th-level caster's sphere inflicts 2d4 points of energy damage. The target may make a Reflex save for half damage against each sphere. If you are attacked with an effect that causes energy damage, and the sphere of that type of energy is still present, you can have that sphere absorb some of that energy damage, destroying the sphere. The sphere absorbs damage that round equal to the amount of damage it would deal if used to attack, so an 8th-level caster's fire sphere absorbs 2d4 points of fire damage. This overlaps (does not stack) with the protection granted by endure elements, resist elements, and protection from elements. Material Component: Five glass marbles.
Tortoise Shell													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=3												SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Creates a 5-ft.-diameter mystic shell														DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.127				DESC:You create a large hemispherical tortoise shell measuring 5 feet in diameter. It has 100 hit points, hardness 10, and can float if turned on its back. You can move it as if it weighed only 10 pounds. To anyone else, it weighs 500 pounds. It stands vertically on its own, providing up to nine-tenths cover from half the battlefield, or you can pull it down over yourself like a shelter. You can change the shell's orientation as a standard action that doesn't incur an attack of opportunity. Up to four Small creatures, two Medium-size creatures, or one Large creature can fit under (or in) the shell. Focus: A whole turtle shell.
Towering Oak													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Ranger=1												SCHOOL:Illusion					SUBSCHOOL:Glamer																		COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:3 rounds/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.128				DESC:You draw on the oak's strength to improve your ability to intimidate your enemies. You gain a competence bonus of +10 on your Intimidate checks.
Transcribe Symbol													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8										SCHOOL:Abjuration																									COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Magical symbol touched																	DURATION:Until discharged or 10 minutes			SAVEINFO:See text						SPELLRES:See text																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.128				DESC:You place a protective magic upon your hand that allows you to touch an untriggered magic symbol such as a glyph of warding or a symbol. The touched symbol is removed from its location and held as magical potential on your hand, like a touch spell. To pick up the spell, you must make a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Failure indicates the glyph or symbol has been triggered. If successfully transferred, you can place the symbol on a surface (not a creature) appropriate to the stored spell as a standard action. The transferred symbol works normally thereafter and retains all its original triggering conditions (although its current location may make its triggers difficult or impossible to achieve). You can maintain the symbol in its potential state as long as you concentrate. If your concentration lapses while the symbol is stored as potential, it immediately triggers upon you (and only you), even if you normally wouldn't meet the trigger conditions. Saving throw and spell resistance rolls are as for the original symbol. The only safe way to rid yourself of the stored spell is to place it on a suitable surface. Focus: A piece of slate that has been scoured bare and smooth on one side.
Translocation Trick												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:You and one other creature																DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.128				DESC:You and the other creature switch locations (as if simultaneously using dimension door spells) and exchange appearances (as if using alter self spells to appear as each other). Your target may resist this spell with a saving throw (the spell automatically affects you). If you or your subject exceeds the capacity of the dimension door spell or if you and your subject have bodies that are so different that the alter self spell could not disguise you as your subject, this spell fails. Magic that penetrates disguises (such as true seeing) reveals the identities of you and your subject. Otherwise, you are considered to be disguised as the other creature and vice versa for the duration of the spell. Actions by you or your subject (such as speaking inappropriately or attacking "allies") can force Disguise checks or alert people nearby that something is wrong. You get a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the subject. When the spell ends, you and the creature revert to your true appearances in your current locations. You do not switch locations again.
Undead Bane Weapon												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=3[PREDEITY:1,Kelemvor]								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Weapon touched																		DURATION:1 hour/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless, object)		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless, object)																			SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.128				DESC:You give a weapon the undead bane property in addition to any other properties it has. Against undead, your weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) is +2 higher than normal and it deals +2d6 points of bonus damage against undead. The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the undead bane property. At caster level 9 (paladin level 18) and above, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not already a magic weapon. Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together, such as in the same quiver. Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their transmutation after they have been fired. The weapon is considered blessed, which means it has special effects on certain creatures. Any weapon affected by this spell glows with a serene gray radiance that sheds as much light as a candle.
Undead Lieutenant													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One undead																			DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.129				DESC:You empower the subject undead with the authority of command over other undead in your control. The targeted undead must have an Intelligence of 5 or higher. Other undead under your control obey the subject undead as if it were you. You may give orders to the undead normally, superseding the orders of the subject of this spell.
Undead Torch													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One corporeal undead																	DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.129				DESC:You cause a corporeal undead to give off cold blue energy that disrupts the life force of living creatures but has no effect on objects or undead. The target creature does an additional 2d4 points of damage with its melee attacks. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the creature attacks it. If it succeeds, the creature is unaffected by that casting of the undead torch. If the undead creature is destroyed, the undead torch continues to burn at the location of its destruction until the duration ends, and creatures that come in contact with the remains take damage. If the undead creature assumes an incorporeal state (such as a vampire assuming gaseous form), the spell disperses harmlessly. Material Component: A living or dead firefly or glowworm.
Undeath after Death.MOD												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=7[PREDEITY:1,Bane]									SCHOOL:Necromancy									DESCRIPTOR:Evil														COMPS:V, S, M			CASTTIME:10 minutes							RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Willing living creature touched															DURATION:Permanent until discharged				SAVEINFO:None (see text)				SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.129				DESC:You tear off a piece of a creature's life force, corrupt it with negative energy and the power of undeath, then bind it to its body to allow a blasphemous transformation should the creature later die. The subject of this spell loses 2 points of Constitution. When the subject dies, the corrupted life force begins a slow change in its body, causing it to animate as a crypt spawn at the next sunset (see the crypt spawn template in Chapter 7). If its remains are destroyed, the undeath after death spell cannot bring it back as an undead. If the spell is dispelled before the subject dies, it does not regain its 2 lost Constitution points. Material Components:A piece of obsidian shaped like a heart, which is placed on the subject's chest, and a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the subject creature at the time the spell is cast, which is placed in the subject's mouth.
Undeath's Eternal Foe												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=9[PREDEITY:1,Lathander]								SCHOOL:Abjuration									DESCRIPTOR:Good														COMPS:V, S, DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature/5 levels																	DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.130				DESC:You grant one or more creatures special abilities that allow them to effectively destroy undead. All subjects receive negative energy protection, except that their roll to resist a negative energy attack has a +10 sacred bonus. The subjects are also immune to special attacks by undead that involve ability damage, ability drain, disease or poison. Subjects can make melee and ranged attacks against ethereal or incorporeal undead as if they were using ghost touch weapons. They also gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by undead.
Undeath to Death													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6									SCHOOL:Necromancy																									COMPS:V, S, M/DF			CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:Several undead creatures within a 50-ft.-radius burst												DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.130				DESC:Undeath to death snuffs out the animating forces of undead creatures, killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those closest to the point of origin of the burst are affected first. Material Component: The powder of a crushed diamond worth at least 500 gp.

When you cast the spell, choose one of the following effects: - entangle (as the spell) - climbing aid (treat as knotted ropes) - bind helpless targets (DC 25 to escape) - hamper movement (as heavy undergrowth) - camouflage (add +4 competence bonus on Hide checks) As a standard action, you may redirect the vines' growth (thus changing the effect). Material Component: A crown of ivy leaves.

Starting on the round you complete the spell, you may spit forth vipers until you reach the number summoned by the spell. You may spit three vipers as a standard action or one viper as a moveequivalent action. Spat vipers land at your feet and act on your turn just as creatures summoned by a summon monster spell. Until you have brought forth all the snakes summoned by the spell, you cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, or activate items that require speech. The snakes are not actually present in your mouth, and do not interfere with your breathing. At the end of the spell, all the vipers disappear, and any not brought forth are lost. When you use a summoning spell to summon an evil or good creature, it is a spell of that type. Material Component: A snakeskin.

One side of the wall, selected by you, is the "hostile side." The wall only provides protection against evil attacks and blocks the movement of summoned or conjured evil creatures that cross from the hostile side to the nonhostile side. Evil creatures that attack you from the nonhostile side of the wall do so without penalties, and evil summoned or conjured creatures can safely cross from the nonhostile side of the wall to the hostile side. The wall of good must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If it is cast so that an object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails.
Wall of Law														TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=4									SCHOOL:Abjuration									DESCRIPTOR:Lawful														COMPS:V, S, M/DF			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Wall whose area is up to one 10-ft square/level or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 5 ft/2 caster level.	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL*10) minutes				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); See text	SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.132				DESC:As wall of good, except that it is similar to magic circle against chaos instead of magic circle against evil.
War Cry														TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=4												SCHOOL:Enchantment				SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting|Sonic											COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)			SPELLRES:Yes (see text)																					SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.132				DESC:You attack with a war cry that bolsters your own courage as well as intimidating your enemies. As a result of this spell, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attacks and damage, or a +4 morale bonus on attacks and damage made as part of a charge attack. Any opponent you attack in melee must make a Will save or become panicked. Once the target makes a successful saving throw against this effect, it cannot be affected by your war cry for one day.
Warning Shout													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Paladin=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation								DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:See text				TARGETAREA:See text																			DURATION:1 round							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No													PREDEITY:1,Arvoreen							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.132				DESC:You speak up to five words, which are magically amplified to be heard by all hearing creatures within half a mile. All within the area hear the words as loud as you spoke them. The spell does not harm people who hear it and cannot transmit magical effects (such as a harpy's song, sonic spells, or charm effects), although a creature already affected by a magical effect (such as a suggestion) could respond to a nonmagical trigger word deployed by a warning shout. Anyone sleeping naturally (as opposed to magically induced sleep, such as from a sleep spell) within the area is woken by the warning shout.
Weapon of the Deity												TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Blackguard,Cleric,Paladin=4									SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, DF				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:Your weapon																			DURATION:1 round/level																																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.132				DESC:You must be using your deity's favored weapon to cast this spell. You may use the weapon as if you had proficiency with it even if you normally do not. The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and an additional special ability (see the list below). A double weapon gains this enhancement bonus and special ability for only one of its two heads, as chosen by the caster. If your deity's weapon is "unarmed strike," your hand is treated as if under the effects of a magic fang (or greater magic fang, as appropriate) spell, that hand is considered armed, the special ability functions normally, and you can touch creatures without invoking the special ability if you desire. When your caster level reaches 9th, the enhancement bonus of the weapon increases to +2. At 12th level, the bonus rises to +3, at 15th level it is +4, and at 18th level it is +5.
Weapon of Impact													TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Transmutation																								COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One weapon or fifty blunt projectiles, all of wich must be in contact with one another at the time of casting.		DURATION:10 minutes/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless,object)		SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.134				DESC:This spell makes a blunt weapon have greater impact, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the blunt weapon. A normal threat range of 20 becomes 19-20. A threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20. The spell has no effect on piercing or slashing weapons, and it does not stack with itself. If cast on sling bullets or other blunt projectiles, the weapon of impact effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.
Wieldskill														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Cleric=1[PREDEITY:1,Gond]									SCHOOL:Divination																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 action								RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																		DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.134				DESC:This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance. The subject gains a +10 competence bonus on a skill check of your choice. If the target has no ranks in the skill, she functions as if she had a half rank in the skill, and therefore is considered trained in the skill (although this half rank adds nothing to her rolls with that skill). Alternatively, the target gains proficiency with a single weapon (simple, martial, or exotic) or type of armor (light, medium, heavy, or shield) as if she had the appropriate feat.
Wind at Back													TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=4												SCHOOL:Evocation																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:Two creatures/level,no two of which can be more than 50-ft apart										DURATION:1 day							SAVEINFO:None (harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.134				DESC:This spell doubles the overland speed of all targets, assuming they are all traveling together in the same direction, including pack animals and mounts. This spell does not affect nonliving material. The spell does not affect tactical speed.
Wind Tunnel														TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=5												SCHOOL:Evocation																									COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One target/level																		DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:Fort negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.134				DESC:You call on the wind to assist your allies' accuracy. This wind tunnel improves the accuracy of ranged weapons, granting each target a +10 competence bonus on ranged attacks. Further, it doubles the range increment of these weapons.
Wounding Whispers													TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard=3												SCHOOL:Abjuration									DESCRIPTOR:Sonic														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																				DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																							SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.134				DESC:You surround yourself with whispers that injure any creature that comes into contact with you. Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons suffers 1d6 points of sonic damage +1 point per caster level. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. You cannot use this spell to deal damage to another target (for instance, with an unarmed attack or by forcing the whispers against a target). Only if another creature touches you does the spell deal damage.
Zajimarn's Avalanche												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9										SCHOOL:Conjuration				SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Cold														COMPS:V, S				CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Long					TARGETAREA:One 10-ft square/level																	DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.134				DESC:You conjure a sweeping wave of ice, snow, and slush that washes away everything it its path. Everything in the initial area of the spell takes 1d4 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d4). Creatures on foot and objects in the initial area must make Reflex saves or be carried along by the wave for 5 feet per caster level. The forced movement does not harm the targets except to leave them prone. Dead-end corridors and similar obstacles prevent the avalanche from moving creatures any farther. The avalanche counts as a water attack for the purpose of extinguishing normal fires.
Zajimarn's Field of Icy Razors										TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Cold														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:One 10-ft square/level																	DURATION:1 minute/level						SAVEINFO:Reflex partial					SPELLRES:Yes				COST:50																	SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.135				DESC:Razor-sharp ice crystals fill the area. Creatures standing in the area at the time the spell is cast take 2d4 points of damage plus 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point/level. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes this damage for each 5 feet of movement through the razored area. Any creature that sustains normal damage from this spell must also succeed at a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its speed by one-third. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding at a Heal check against the spell's save DC. Each 5-foot square section has effectively 20 hit points. Even when all the ice has been destroyed, frigid air remains in the area and deals 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point/level to creatures that pass through it. Focus: A silver shuriken worth 50 gp that looks like a snowflake.
Zajimarn's Ice Claw Prison											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7										SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Cold														COMPS:V, S, F			CASTTIME:1 standard action						RANGE:Medium				TARGETAREA:10-ft ice claw																		DURATION:1 round/level						SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																						SOURCELONG:Magic of Faerun						SOURCESHORT:Mag				SOURCEPAGE:p.135				DESC:Similar to Bigby's grasping hand, this spell creates a Medium-size reptilian claw made of ice. The ice claw gets one grappling attack per round. Its attack bonus to make contact is your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively), +7 for the claw's Strength score (24). Its grapple check is this same figure. When the claw succeeds at a grapple, it inflicts normal grapple damage (1d3 points plus its Strength modifier). You can direct it to damage or pin its target on your turn as a free action. On any round that the claw is grappling a target, it deals 1d8 points of cold damage in addition to any other damage it causes. The claw can attack on the round it appears. Directing it to change targets is a standard action. It always attacks from your direction and does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. The claw has as many hit points as you do when undamaged and is AC 20 (+10 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that do not deal damage do not affect it. The claw cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field. It suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The claw makes saving throws as if it were you. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. It is immune to cold but takes double damage from fire. Focus: A white leather glove and a piece of clear rock crystal.
