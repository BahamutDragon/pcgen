Attune Gem			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Itemcreation													PRESKILL:1,Craft (Gemcuting)=1	PRESTAT:1,INT=13	DESC:You can magically imbue gems to hold a spell until triggered.															SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You can store an arcane spell in a gem. You must have the spell available to cast (prepared if you must prepare spells; known otherwise) and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce your XP total, you pay the cost upon beginning the attunement in addition to the XP cost for making the attuned gem itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when you begin casting, but focuses are not. (A focus used in attuning a gem can be reused.) The caster level of the spell must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own caster level.  A gem can only be attuned with a single spell. The gem must have a minimum value equal to 50 gp per level of the spell to be stored. The base price of an attuned gem (not including the gem?s inherent value) is equal to 50 gp per spell level times the caster level. You must spend 1/25 of the base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price. Attunement requires 1 hour plus the spell?s normal casting time. The magic gem?s market price equals its base price plus its inherent value as a gem.  See the Gem Magic section in the previous chapter for the details of attuned gems and gem magic.
Reactive Counterspell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Counterspell,Improved Initiative													DESC:You can react quickly to counterspells cast by opponents.																SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:Once per round, you can counterspell an opponent?s spell even if you have not readied an action to do so. This counterspell action takes the place of your regular action for the round. You can?t use this feat when flat-footed.
Spell Girding		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																						DESC:your spells are particularly hardy, resisting dispel checks more readily than normal.											SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Any dispel checks against your spells are made with a -2 penalty.
Spell Thematics		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																						DESC:Your spells have a distinct visual or auditory effect in their manifestation.													SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:Choose a theme for your spellcasting, such as ice or fire or screaming skulls. All spells you cast have this theme in the manifestation of their effects, although this does not actually change the spell in any way. You cannot use this feat to make your spell manifestations invisible, and it never causes your spells to deal more damage because of the visual change. (You may still cast spells without this thematic manifestation if you so choose.)  For example, if your theme is fire, then your magic missile spell might appear to produce bolts of fire, although the bolts still are a force effect and cause normal damage, not fire damage. If your theme is ?screaming skulls,? your fireball might manifest as a small screaming skull that impacts the target and explodes into a fiery ball that momentarily resembles a 20-foot-radius burning skull, although it causes damage exactly like a standard fireball (and doesn?t cause any sonic damage, despite the screaming of the skull).  Add +5 to the DC of any Spellcraft check made to identify a spell cast in this manner.
Spellfire Wielder		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General										PRELEVELMAX:1										DESC:You are one of the rare people who have the innate talent to control raw magic in the form of spellfire.								SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You can use spellfire to absorb spell energy, fire destructive blasts, or heal others, as described in the Spellfire section of the previous chapter.


# BASICS
# Feat Name			Type			Required Feat							Maximum Level	Required Skill				Required Stat	Description																		Stackable?	Multiple?	Add Spell Lvl	Source Page		Benefits
CATEGORY=FEAT|Augment Summoning.MOD	TYPE:General																						DESC:Your summoned creatures are better than normal.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:Creatures you summon with any summoning spell are slightly enhanced. They gain one more die of hit points (but they are not treated as +1 HD creatures) and a +1 competence bonus on their attack and damage rolls.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Energy Substitution.MOD	TYPE:Metamagic	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic								PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Arcana)=5				DESC:You can modify a spell that uses one type of energy to use another type of energy.					STACK:NO	MULT:YES	ADDSPELLLEVEL:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can modify any spell with an energy designator to use the chosen type of energy instead. A substituted spell works normally in all respects, except that the type of damage dealt changes. For example, an acidic fireball still deals damage in a 20-foot spread, except that it is acid damage instead of fire damage.  If a spell has a secondary effect, the altered spell still has that effect. For example, a shout spell can deafen creatures and deals extra damage to crystalline creatures; if fire is substituted for sonic energy in a shout spell, creatures can still be deafened and crystalline creatures still suffer extra damage. Sometimes a spell?s minor effects are directly related to the spell?s energy, for example, a flaming sphere can set items afire, but a purely sonic or acidic flaming sphere does not.  When a spell deals some damage that does not come from energy, Energy Substitution does not affect that portion of the spell. For example, ice storm deals 3d6 points of impact damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. An electrical ice storm deals 3d6 points of impact damage and 2d6 points of electricity damage.  A substituted spell uses a spell slot zero levels higher than (the same as) the spell?s actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Eschew Materials.MOD	TYPE:Metamagic	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																	DESC:You can cast spells without material components.															ADDSPELLLEVEL:0	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:A spell cast with Eschew Materials can be cast with no material components. Spells without material components are not affected. Spells with material components with a cost of more than 1 gp are not affected. An eschewed spell uses up a spell slot zero levels higher than (the same as) the spell?s actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Widen Spell.MOD		TYPE:Metamagic																						DESC:You can increase the are of your spells.																ADDSPELLLEVEL:3	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:A widened burst, emanation, or spread spell has its radius increased by 50%%. Spells that do not have an area of one of these three sorts are not affected by this feat. A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell?s actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Spell Girding.MOD																										DESC:Your spells are particularly hardy, resisting dispel checks more readly than normal.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Spellfire Wielder.MOD																									DESC:You are una of the rare people who have the innate talent to control raw magic in the form of spellfire.
