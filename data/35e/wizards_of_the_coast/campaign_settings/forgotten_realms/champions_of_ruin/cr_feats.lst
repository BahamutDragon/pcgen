# Feat Name				Type			Required Text														Description																						Source Page		Description of the Benefits
Bloodsoaked Intimidate		TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Snatch Trophy.										DESC:Your bloody and vicious approach to combat makes you a fearsome foe.											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:When you collect a trophy using the Snatch Trophy feat, you can make an Intimidate check as a swift action against an adjacent opponent who witnesses your savage act (see the Swift and Immediate Actions sidebar for more information). Normal: Making an Intimidate check in combat is a standard action.
Chakram Ricochet			TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Dex 13, base attack bonus +1, proficient with chakram.				DESC:You can hurl a chakram so that it strikes two enemies instead of one.											SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:If you hit a creature with a thrown chakram, you can cause it to ricochet and strike a secondary target in an adjacent square (within 5 feet of the primary target). You immediately make an attack roll against the secondary target, at a –2 penalty. If the attack hits, you deal damage normally. Special: A rogue with Chakram Ricochet can deal sneak attack damage to both targets if they are within 30 feet and denied their Dexterity bonus to AC.
Corrupt Spell			TYPE:Metamagic	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.										DESC:You can transform one of your spells into a thing of evil due to a deal you make with an evil power.						SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:This feat adds the evil descriptor to one damaging spell you can cast. You must choose the spell at the time you select the feat. If the spell deals damage, half of the damage is unholy damage. For example, a corrupted fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard deals 6d6 points of damage: 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of unholy damage. Thus, creatures immune to fire still potentially take 3d6 points of damage. Special: A character can take this feat multiple times, choosing a different spell each time. This feat originally appeared in Book of Vile Darkness and has been revised for D&D v.3.5.
Craven				TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Sneak attack class feature, cannot be immune to fear.				DESC:Like most sly rogues, you are a dangerous coward. However, your sneak attacks deal more damage than normal.					SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:You take a –2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. However, when making a sneak attack, you deal an extra 1 point of damage per character level.
Dire Flail Smash			TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Str 13, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, Weapon Focus (dire flail).		DESC:You have mastered the style of fighting with the dire flail and have learned to deal thunderous blows with the weapon.			SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:If you hit the same creature with both ends of your dire flail in the same round, it must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or be dazed by the pain for 1 round. Special: A fighter can select this feat as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Dirty Rat				TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Tumble 4 ranks.										DESC:You are quite adept at slipping under a foe’s guard while he’s distracted.										SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:You gain an additional +1 bonus on attack rolls when flanking an opponent.

SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:You can spend one of your bardic music uses to utter a string of crass and appalling epithets and curses at one enemy within 120 feet. The intended target must be able to hear and comprehend your damning remarks. A target that fails a Will save (DC 10 + your character level + your Cha modifier) is cursed with a –10 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 round. This is a supernatural, necromantic effect.
Entangling Spell			TYPE:Metamagic																	DESC:Your spell releases residual eldritch power that entangles your enemies.											SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:The feat can be applied to any instantaneous spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, such as fireball or lightning bolt. After the spell is cast, lingering tendrils of raw energy persist; creatures damaged by the spell are entangled for 1 round. The spell is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. An entangling spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
Feral Animal Companion		TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Animal companion class feature, evil alignment.					DESC:You can enslave a feral animal and adopt it as your animal companion.											SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:Instead of calling a normal animal companion, you can call a feral animal companion that foams at the mouth. Any creature harmed by the animal’s bite attack must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract red ache (see Dungeon Master’s Guide page 292). The disease has no harmful effect on the feral animal. In addition, your feral animal companion gains a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution. Attempts by others to influence your feral animal companion with Handle Animal checks take a –10 penalty. Special: This feat does not transform a normal animal companion into a feral animal companion.
Flay Foe				TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Str 15, base attack bonus +6, proficient with slashing melee weapon.	DESC:You are skilled at flaying the flesh from your enemy’s bones.												SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:If you hit the same enemy more than once in a single round with a slashing melee weapon, you deal an extra point of damage with each hit after the first.

Lingering Spell			TYPE:Metamagic																	DESC:Residual eldritch energy from your spell continues to harm your enemies after the spell’s main effect has expired.				SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:The feat can be applied to any one instantaneous spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, such as fireball or lightning bolt. After the spell is cast, lingering tendrils of energy persist, dealing 1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type at the beginning of your next turn to all creatures initially damaged by the spell. The spell is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. A lingering spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.
Malign Spell Focus		TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.										DESC:Your evil spells are more potent than normal due to a deal forged with an evil power.								SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against any of your spells that have the evil descriptor. Special: This feat originally appeared in Book of Vile Darkness and has been revised for D&D v.3.5.
Mortifying Attack			TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Death attack class feature.								DESC:Those who witness your brutal death attack are unnerved and jarred by the experience.								SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:All creatures within 30 feet that witness you make a successful death attack must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to death attack damage dealt) or be shaken for 2d4 rounds. Any creature you consider your ally is unaffected. In addition, creatures that fail the save are so horrified by the attack that they lose their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class for 1 round. The target of the death attack must also make the saving throw if it survives. This extraordinary ability is a fear effect.
Mutilator				TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +4, any evil alignment.						DESC:After striking down your enemy in battle, you can skillfully mutilate the corpse to prevent others from raising it from the dead.	SOURCEPAGE:p.20	BENEFIT:After delivering the killing blow to a creature (that is, reducing it to –10 hit points) with a melee weapon, you can decapitate or otherwise hack apart the corpse as a free action. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity and ensures that the creature cannot be revived using a raise dead spell. You can mutilate only one enemy per round in this fashion.
Natural Bully			TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Intimidate 6 ranks.										DESC:You easily terrify weaker adversaries.																SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:All enemies within 30 feet of you that have one-half your Hit Dice or less are bullied; they take a –2 morale penalty on attack rolls made against you. A bullied enemy that succeeds in hitting and damaging you is no longer subject to the penalty and cannot be bullied by you for 24 hours. Creatures immune to fear effects cannot be bullied and do not take the penalty on attacks rolls to hit you.
Poison Immunity			TYPE:General																	DESC:After prolonged exposure to a poison or toxin, you have rendered yourself immune to it.								SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:You are immune to one specific poison (chosen by you), whether available as a blade poison, the venom of a specific creature, or one other toxin. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against other poisons. Special: A character can take this feat multiple times, choosing a different poison each time. The +1 bonus against other poisons does not stack with itself.
Profane Outburst			TYPE:Divine		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to rebuke undead, evil alignment.						DESC:With a horrendous release of divine energy, you steel your undead allies and minions against harm.						SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can spend one of your rebuke attempts to bathe all undead creatures within 60 feet in divine energy, granting them a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class for 1 minute.
Pulverize Foe			TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Str 15, base attack bonus +6, proficient with bludgeoning melee weapon.	DESC:You enjoy smashing your opponents into submission.

Shadowform Familiar		TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Krinth, summon familiar class feature.						DESC:You can summon a familiar from the Plane of Shadow.														SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:Your summoned familiar looks like a dark, shadowy version of a normal familiar. It is insubstantial and gains the incorporeal subtype (see Monster Manual page 310). A shadowform familiar is more closely bound to you than a normal familiar, and the maximum distance from you the shadowform familiar can travel is 30 feet per caster level. If you are separated from your shadowform familiar by a distance greater than this, the shadowform familiar dissolves into nothingness and is considered slain. Special: This feat does not transform a normal familiar into a shadowform familiar.
Shadowstrike			TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Krinth, base attack bonus +1.								DESC:Due to your ties to the Plane of Shadow, you strike more effectively in areas of dim illumination.						SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:When making an attack with a melee weapon in an area of shadowy illumination (see Player’s Handbook page 164), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on the attack roll and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage. Special: A krinth fighter can select this feat as one of his fighter bonus feats.

SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:After dealing a creature enough damage to drop it to negative hit points, you can slice or pry off a trophy as a free action. You must be adjacent to the dead or dying creature. The trophy could be a small body part such as a finger or ear. Carving a trophy in this manner requires a light slashing or piercing weapon and deals 1d6 points of damage to the target creature. (A creature with regeneration can regrow the severed body part.) Alternatively, you can take a small item worn or carried by your fallen foe, such as a piece of jewelry, pouch, potion, light weapon, or helmet, in which case the victim takes no damage. The snatched item can weigh no more than 2 pounds. You must have a free hand to collect the trophy.
Touch of Benevolence		TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.										DESC:Despite your evil alignment, you are prone to moments of benevolence and mercy.									SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:Although you are evil and spells such as detect evil reveal your true alignment, you have a 50% chance of ignoring any effect that specifically targets or damages evil creatures. Special: To keep this feat, a character must demonstrate periodic acts of kindness and mercy. A DM can revoke this feat if the character fails to act in an appropriately conflicted manner.
Via Negativa			TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to rebuke undead.									DESC:You can channel greater amounts of negative energy into your inflict spells.										SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:As a free action, you can spend one of your rebuke attempts to deal additional harm with an inflict spell. You must spend the rebuke attempt before making the attack roll.

###Block: Node Magic
# Feat Name		Type			Required Text								Description																Source Page		Description of the Benefits
Metanode Spell	TYPE:Metamagic	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.	DESC:You cast metamagic spells to greater effect in nodes to which you are attuned than elsewhere.	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:When casting a spell improved by a metamagic feat, you can deduct the class of the node layer in which you currently stand from the increased spell level. The class of the layer does not equal the class of the node unless you are standing in the innermost portion of it. For example, if you use Maximize Spell to augment the 5thlevel spell flame strike in the innermost (+1) layer of a Class 1 node, you cast the spell as if it were only two levels higher than normal, not three, because the node pays one spell level’s worth of the metamagic cost. This feat is most useful to casters who do not prepare spells (such as bards and sorcerers) and to wizards who rarely leave their nodes and can therefore prepare and cast their spells at the adjusted level. If you use this feat to reduce the cost of preparing a metamagic spell and then leave the node, the spell you prepared is unavailable until you return to a node layer of at least the same class as the one in which the spell was prepared.
Node Defense	TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.	DESC:You can use the magical power of a node to defend yourself from harm.					SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You receive an insight bonus to your Armor Class and on saving throws equal to the class of any node that you currently occupy and to which you are attuned, up to a maximum of +4. For example, if you are inside the middle (+2) layer of a Class 3 node, you gain a +2 bonus.
Node Sensitive	TYPE:General											DESC:You can perceive a node just by passing near it.									SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You automatically note the presence of any node to which you are attuned within 30 feet. Normal: A creature without this feat that comes within 30 feet of the outermost layer of a node can make a DC 20 Intelligence check to note the presence of the node. A creature with the appropriate Node Spellcasting feat can attempt either an Intelligence check or a Spellcraft check at the same DC to notice the node.
Node Spellcasting	TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 1st.				DESC:You have discovered the secret of the magic of a particular type of node.				SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:You are attuned to one type of node and the magical power it provides. When you choose this feat, choose a type of node (earth, evil, or Shadow Weave). This feat grants you access to the various node magic feats and node powers, and allows you to make a Spellcraft check instead of an Intelligence check to notice nearby nodes of the type to which you are attuned. Normal: A creature without this feat cannot take other noderelated feats, cannot access a node’s full potential, and must make an Intelligence check to notice nearby nodes or to manipulate node powers. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it attunes you to a different node type.
Node Store		TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.	DESC:You can store a prepared spell in a node to which you are attuned.						SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:Each time you take this feat, choose two spells of any level that you know and can cast. If you are a spellcaster who prepares spells, you can now prepare those two spells in addition to your normal spell complement as long as you are in a node to which you are attuned, just as if you had two extra spell slots per day. These extra prepared spells are stored in the node instead of in your mind. You can cast them normally while you are within that node, even if you have left the node and returned since storing them there. If you are a spellcaster who does not prepare spells, choose two spells that you know. You can now cast those two spells while in a node to which you are attuned as if you had two extra spell slots per day available. Each such slot can be used only to cast its designated spell; it cannot be used for any other spell (including the other spell designated with this feat). If you leave the node, these extra spell slots become unavailable to you, but you can use them again if you return, provided that you haven’t already used them since the last time you rested. You do not need to designate a specific node in which to store your spells when you choose this feat, but you can have spells stored in only one node at a time. You can change the node in which your spells are stored by meditating for 1 hour inside the new node you have selected. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to two new spells.
