#115
Disease (Su): Any creature hit by an abyssal ghoul's front claw or rear claw attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or contract demon fever. After an incubation period of 1 day, the disease deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Each day after contracting demon fever, the creature must succeed at another Fortitude save (DC 18) or take the same damage. Each time it is damaged by the disease, the creature must immediately succeed at another Fortitude save (DC 18) or 1 point of the Constitution damage taken becomes Constitution drain instead. After making a successful Fortitude save against the Constitution damage on each of two consecutive days, the creature recovers.
#116
Improved Grab (Ex): If an abyssal ghoul hits an opponent its own size or smaller with both front claws, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +15). If it gets a hold, it can attempt to pin and use its Wisdom drain ability on its next grapple check. Alternatively, the abyssal ghoul has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its front claws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the ghoul is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals damage from both front claws.
Sneak Attack (Ex): Any time the abyssal ghoul's target is denied a Dexterity bonus, or when it is flanked by the abyssal ghoul, the latter deals an additional +5d6 points of damage on a successful melee attack.
Wisdom Drain (Su): If an abyssal ghoul successfully pins a living opponent, it can drain 1d6 points of Wisdom with its smoky tongue on the same action. Each round thereafter that the pin is maintained, it automatically drains an additional 1d6 points of Wisdom. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom by an abyssal ghoul becomes unconscious until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.
Blindsight (Ex): An abyssal ghoul is blind, but it maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature by using scent and vibration to ascertain its surroundings. This ability enables it to discern objects and creatures within 90 feet. The abyssal ghoul usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight.
Deathwatch (Sp): This ability functions like the deathwatch spell, except that it is always active and the abyssal ghoul always knows how near death all creatures within 90 feet of it are. Because of this knowledge, it often pauses to kill fragile creatures (those with 3 or fewer hit points remaining) before moving on to attack healthier foes.
Uncanny Dodge (Ex): An abyssal ghoul retains its Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed or struck by an attacker it can't perceive. In addition, it cannot be flanked except by a rogue of 20th level or higher.


# Demon, Blood Fiend
#Special Attacks: Blood drain, domination, energy drain, spelllike abilities
#Special Qualities: Acid resistance 20, alternate form, cold resistance 20, create spawn, DR 20/+2, electricity immunity, fast healing 5, fire resistance 20, gaseous form, SR 24, turn resistance +6

#117
Blood Drain (Ex): A blood fiend sucks blood from a living victim when it hits with its bite attack. Each successful blood drain attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain.
Domination (Su): Like a vampire, a blood fiend can crush an opponent's will by looking into its eyes. This attack functions like a gaze effect, except that it is a standard action, and creatures merely looking at the blood fiend are not affected. Any creature within 30 feet that the blood fiend targets for the attack falls instantly under its influence as though by a dominate monster spell (caster level 18th, Will save DC 21).
Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by a blood fiend's claw attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 21) or gain one negative level. For each negative level bestowed, the blood fiend heals 5 points of damage. If the amount of healing is more than the damage the creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. If the negative level has not been removed (with a spell such as restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 21) to remove it. Failure means the opponent's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-detect good, detect magic, teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only); 3/day-chaos hammer, darkness, unholy blight; 1/day-blasphemy, desecrate. Caster level 18th; save DC 15 + spell level.
Alternate Form (Su): A blood fiend can assume the shape of a regular or fiendish dire bat, a dire wolf, a howler, or a nightmare as a standard action. This ability functions like a polymorph self spell (caster level 12th), except that the blood fiend also gains the extraordinary abilities of the form assumed. The creature can remain in the assumed form indefinitely.
Create Spawn (Su): An outsider of the evil subtype slain by a blood fiend's energy drain attack (negative levels equal to current Hit Dice, or drained below 1st level) rises as a blood fiend 1d4 days after death. The new blood fiend does not possess any of the abilities it had in life.
Fast Healing (Ex): A blood fiend heals 5 points of damage per round as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points or lower, a blood fiend automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. Its fast healing begins as soon as it has rested anywhere (it is not limited to a coffin) for 1 hour without interruption. A dismissal, dispel evil, banishment, dictum, or holy word spell cast on it while its current hit points are below 1 destroys it utterly.
Gaseous Form (Su): At will, a blood fiend can assume gaseous form as a standard action. This ability functions like the gaseous form spell (caster level 5th), except that the blood fiend can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
Skills: A blood fiend receives a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.

# Maurezhi
#Special Attacks: Consume, paralysis, pounce, spell-like abilities
#Special Qualities: Assume shape, DR 10/+1, outsider traits, SR 19, summon creatures, tanar'ri traits
#118
SR
Paralysis (Ex): Any creature hit by a maurezhi's claw or bite attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (13, or DC 10 + 1/2 the maurezhi's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier, whichever is higher) or be paralyzed for 1d6+4 minutes.
Pounce (Ex): If a maurezhi charges, it can make a full attack even though it has moved.
Spell-Like Abilities: Always active-deathwatch; at will- animate dead, blur, cause fear, chill touch, death knell, hold person, invisibility; 3/day-fear. Caster level equal to total HD; save DC 13 + spell level.
Assume Shape (Su): A maurezhi can take on the appearance of any humanoid creature whose corpse it has consumed. This ability functions like the alter self spell (caster level 10th), except that the maurezhi can remain in the chosen form indefinitely. It can assume a new form or return to its own as a standard action.
Summon Creatures (Sp): This ability functions like a summon monster spell of the appropriate level, except that it has only a limited chance of success. Once per day a maurezhi can attempt to summon 1d4 ghouls with a 100%% chance of success, or 2d4 dretches with a 60%% chance of success.
Skills: A maurezhi gains a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks. *When using its assume shape ability, a maurezhi receives an additional +12 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks (reflecting its access to the consumed form's memories as well as its physical alteration).

# Drider Vampire
#119
Attach (Ex): If a drider vampire hits with its bite attack, it latches onto the opponent's body and begins draining blood the same round. An attached drider vampire's AC is 21.
Blood Drain (Ex): A drider vampire drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain immediately upon attaching to its opponent. Each round thereafter that it remains attached, it automatically deals an additional 1d4 points of Constitution drain.
Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by a drider vampire's claw attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 18) or gain one negative level. For each negative level bestowed, the drider vampire heals 5 points of damage. If the amount of healing is more than the damage the creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. If the negative level has not been removed (with a spell such as restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) to remove it. Failure means the opponent's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.
Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-dancing lights, darkness, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, faerie fire, levitate. Caster level 6th; save DC 15 + spell level.
Spells: A drider vampire retains all the spellcasting abilities it had in life. Most driders are 6th-level clerics, wizards, or sorcerers. Drider vampire clerics usually worship Kiaransalee (even though they served Lolth in life), and they choose their domains from Chaos, Drow, Evil, Retribution, and Undeath.
Spider Mastery (Su): A drider vampire can compel a spiderkind creature (see Spiderkind sidebar) to obey its mental commands. An unwilling, intelligent target that fails a Will saving throw (DC 18) obeys one command as if under a suggestion spell. A successful save allows the creature to resist the command, but the drider vampire can attempt to command it again next round. Commanding an unwilling target requires a standard action; otherwise, issuing commands is a free action.
Alternate Form (Su): A drider vampire can assume the shape of a monstrous spider of any size from Tiny to Large as a standard action. This ability functions like a polymorph self spell (caster level 12th). The creature can remain in spider form until it chooses to revert to its natural form or until the next sunrise.
Fast Healing (Ex): A drider vampire heals 5 points of damage per round as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points or lower, it automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its web nest within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) After 1 hour of rest in its nest, its hit point total rises to 1, then it resumes fast healing at its normal rate.
Gaseous Form (Su): At will, a drider vampire can assume gaseous form as a standard action. This ability functions like the gaseous form spell (caster level 5th), except that the drider vampire can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
Skills: A drider vampire gains skills as an aberration. It receives a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks.

# Spiderstone Golem
#120
Berserk (Ex): When a spiderstone golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that its demon spirit breaks free and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. A divine spellcaster of a drow deity, if within 60 feet, can try (Diplomacy DC 19) to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem. Resting for 1 minute resets the golem's berserk chance to 0%.
Fighting Spirit: A spiderstone golem gains a +4 racial bonus on attack rolls (already figured into the statistics above).
Spit Web (Su): A spiderstone golem can spit forth a web as a ranged touch attack (maximum range 90 feet, range increment 10 feet). A Large or smaller creature hit by this attack is entangled (-2 on attack rolls, -4 penalty to Dexterity, unable to move). An entangled creature attempting to cast a spell must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15) to do so. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check (DC 26) or burst the web with a Strength check (DC 32). Both are standard actions. Once the golem spits a web, it can't spit another one until 1d4 rounds later.
Magic Immunity (Ex): A spiderstone golem is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects except Evocation spells and effects, and divine spells cast by drow divine spellcasters. Against such spells and effects, the golem's spell resistance still applies. Unlike stone golems, a spiderstone golem is not affected by transmute rock to mud or stone to flesh spells.
#121
Spider Climb (Su): A spiderstone golem can move on walls or ceilings as if under the effect of a spider climb spell, except that it moves at its full normal speed. This ability is always in effect.
Webwalking (Su): Spiderstone golems can move freely through any normal or magical web, as if affected by a freedom of movement spell. They can walk along webs as if on solid ground (no Balance check required).
Feats: A spiderstone golem gains feats as a humanoid with the fighter class.

# Jade Spider
#121
Forcecage Web (Su): Eight times per day, a jade spider can cast a magical web of glowing green energy as a standard action. This effect functions like a forcecage spell, except that it affects only one target and allows a Reflex save (DC 17) to avoid the effect. A target that fails its saving throw is imprisoned within a barred cage of force. After using its forcecage web, a jade spider must wait 2d4 rounds before doing so again.
Petrification (Su): The bite of a jade spider injects a glowing green venom that turns the victim to stone. A creature bitten by the spider must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 22) or immediately turn to stone.
Wounding (Su): A wound resulting from a jade spider's leg slash bleeds for an additional 1 point of damage per round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only by a successful Heal check (DC 15) or the application of a cure spell or some other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or the like).
#122
See Invisibility (Su): This ability functions like a see invisibility spell, except that it is always active and its range extends to the limit of the jade spider's vision.

# Orb Wraith
Constitution Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by an orb wraith's incorporeal touch attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 32) or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain.
Enervation Ray (Su): An orb wraith can attack with a bolt of negative energy that functions like the enervation spell. This attack is a ray with a maximum range of 60 feet and no range increment. A creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 negative levels.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will-bane, bestow curse, doom, fear; 3/day-circle of death, circle of doom; 1/day-destruction. Caster level 20th; save DC 17 + spell level.
Assimilate (Su): If an orb wraith kills an ordinary wraith (even one of its own spawn), it assimilates the lesser wraith's energy into itself, growing stronger in the process. It adds the assimilated wraith's Hit Dice (usually 5) to its own, to a maximum of 60 HD. It gains all the benefits of these additional HD acording to the monster advancement rules in the Monster Manual. When an orb wraith advances to 60 HD, it fissions into two 30-HD orb wraiths.
Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by an orb wraith becomes a normal wraith in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the orb wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
# 123
Unnatural Aura (Su): Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of an orb wraith at a distance of 90 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.

# Quth-Maren
Caustic Blood (Ex): A quth-maren's natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of acid damage from the creature's caustic blood. Any creature hitting a quth-maren with natural weapons or unarmed attacks also takes 1d6 points of acid damage.
Spit Blood (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a quth-maren can spit a glob of its acidic blood as a grenadelike weapon attack. The quth-maren must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit its target. This attack has a range increment of 10 feet, with a maximum range of 5 range increments. The glob deals 2d6 points of acid damage on a direct hit, and 2 points of splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of where it lands.
Horrifying Gaze (Su): A living creature within 30 feet that meets a quth-maren's deathless gaze must succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or cower in fear (lose Dexterity bonus to AC, unable to act, any foe gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls).
Command Undead (Su): Because the quth-maren was an evil cleric in life, it can command undead as a 5th-level evil cleric. It cannot rebuke undead, but it can dispel turning or bolster other undead.
Fast Healing (Ex): A quth-maren regains lost hit points at the rate of 4 per round, as long as it has at least 1 hit point. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow the quth-maren to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

# Wraith Spider
#124
Strength Damage (Su): The bite of a Large or smaller wraith spider deals Strength damage, as noted it the table on the facing page.
Energy Drain (Su): The bite of a Huge or larger wraith spider bestows negative levels on the victim instead of dealing Strength damage. A Huge wraith spider bestows one negative level, and the Fortitude save to remove it has a DC of 16. A Gargantuan wraith spider bestows two negative levels (DC 25), and a Colossal wraith spider bestows 1d4 negative levels (DC 39). As a special ability, a wraith spider gains the same bonus to the DC for its energy drain ability that living a vermin gets to its poison save DC.
Tremorsense (Ex): A wraith spider can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.
