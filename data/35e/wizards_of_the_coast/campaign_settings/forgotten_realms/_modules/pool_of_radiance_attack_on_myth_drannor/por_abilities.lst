SOURCEPAGE:p.84
Detect Magic			KEY:Dragonkin ~ Detect Magic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Dragonkin Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:Dragonkin have the innate ability to detect magic at will, as a free action. They have an overpowering desire to acquire magic items, and target characters who possess these items in preference to others. If possible, a dragonkin will grab a magic item from its opponent and flee with it, taking the item back to its cave. (Resolve this as a disarm attempt; since the dragonkin is unarmed, it holds the item if it wins the opposed check.) Dragonkin who are fighting on the ground do not take unreasonable risks to flee with an item-they never turn their backs on an opponent, for example. Cult dragonkin are better able to resist their instinctual desire for magic, and they do not endanger or abandon their mission for the sake of these items. Tribal dragonkin do not use magic items in combat, but Cult dragonkin often do, if appropriate.															SOURCEPAGE:p.84
