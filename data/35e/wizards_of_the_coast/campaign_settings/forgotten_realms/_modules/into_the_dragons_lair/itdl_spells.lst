# Spell Name	Unique Key			Classes of caster			School		Sub-School		Descriptor			Components		Casting Time	Range			Target Area or Effect								Duration				Save Info					Spell Resistance		Source Page		Description
Claws of Darkness					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Shadow					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:1 round/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:You draw material from the Plane of Shadow to cause your hands and forearms to elongate and change shape into featureless claws of inky blackness. Starting on your next action, you may use the claws to make unarmed attacks as if they were natural weapons. (You attack with one claw and can use the other claw for an off-hand attack; if you have multiple attacks you use them normally when attacking with the claws.) Attacks with the claws are melee touch attacks. Each claw does 1d4 points of cold damage. If you grapple an opponent, you deal claw damage with each successful grapple check, and the grappled target is under the effects of a slow spell for as long as you maintain the grapple unless the opponent makes a Fortitude save. You can extend the claws up to 6 feet and retract them again, as a free action, which gives you natural reach of 10 feet. When the spell is in effect, you may not cast spells with anything other than verbal (V) components, nor may you carry items with your hands. Any magic items worn on your hands are temporarily absorbed and cease functioning while the spell is active. If you fail to overcome your opponent's spell resistance, your attacks with this spell have no effect.
Ironguard, Lesser	KEY:Ironguard (Lesser)	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5	SCHOOL:Abjuration								COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched							DURATION:1 round/level		SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:You or a creature you touch becomes immune to nonmagical metal. Metal items (including metal weapons) simply pass through you as if they were ethereal, and you can walk through metal barriers such as iron bars. Magical or enchanted metal affects you normally, as do spells and supernatural effects. Attacks delivered by metal items (such as poison on a dagger) affect you normally. If the spell expires while metal is inside you, the metal object is shunted out of your body (or you away from the metal, if it is an immovable object like a set of iron bars). You and the object take 1d6 points of damage as a result (ignoring the object's hardness rating for determining damage to it). Because you pass through metal, you may ignore armor and hardness bonuses on opponents you attack with unarmed attacks. Arcane Material Component: A tiny shield of wood, glass, or crystal.
Net of Shadows					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Shadow	DESCRIPTOR:Darkness	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature per level within a 25-ft.-radius burst	DURATION:3 rounds			SAVEINFO:Will negates (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:You cause ordinary shadows to fly toward the creatures in the area, forming dark nets that cover and enfold the target(s). The net does not hamper movement, but a creature enfolded in a net cannot see beyond five feet, even with darkvision. The folds of a net hides the creature within it, giving the creature 90%% concealment (attacks suffer a 40%% miss chance). The net also hampers the enfolded subject's own attacks, granting 90%% concealment to creatures with five feet and 100%% concealment to creatures more that five feet away (50%% miss chance). A subject that saves is disoriented and suffers a -1 morale penalty on its next action.
Shadow Mask						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Shadow					COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)											SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:You cause a mask of shadows to form around your face. This does not impede your vision, cannot be physically removed, completely hides your features, and protects you against certain attacks. You are protected against extremes of light and darkness, such as the flare spell or the fireworks effect of pyrotechnics. You gain a +4 resistance bonus against gaze attacks and a +2 bonus to Disguise checks made to oppose a Spot check to recognize you. When the spell's duration ends, the shadow mask fades over the course of 1d4 rounds (rather than immediately), giving you time to keep your face hidden via other means. A successful dispel magic cast against a shadow mask ends the spell and causes the same slow fading. Arcane Material Component: A mask of black cloth.
Shadow Spray					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Shadow					COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:5-foot-radius burst						DURATION:1 round/level		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:You cause a multitude of ribbonlike shadows to instantaneously explode outward from the target point. Creatures in the area take 2 points of Strength damage, are dazed for 1 round, and take a -2 morale penalty on saves against fear spells and effects. The fear penalty ends when this spell ends, but the Strength damage remains until healed. Arcane Material Component: a handful of black ribbons.
Shadow Well						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Shadow					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Close													DURATION:1 round/level		SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:You cause the target's shadow to become a temporary gate to a pocket realm within the Plane of Shadow. The target must make a Will save or fall into the gateway; inside the pocket realm he sees a deserted, gloomy duplicate of the real world, while shadowy phantasms stalk and taunt him without causing actual harm. When the duration ends, the victim returns to the real world and is afraid for 1d4 rounds. The victim flees in a random direction for that time. Beings unable to flee cower. On leaving the pocket realm, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the shadow well spell was cast. If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject safely appears nearby. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a shadow well spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell as normal (but the target is still afraid upon leaving).
