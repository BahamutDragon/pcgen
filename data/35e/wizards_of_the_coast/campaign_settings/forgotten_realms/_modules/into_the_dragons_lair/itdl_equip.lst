Black Cage of Hagulrim				TYPE:Cage	COST:81900	WT:50						SOURCEPAGE:p.93	SPROP:This cage of fine black ironwork holds up to two Medium-size creatures or three Small ones. When disassembled, it fits in a backpack. When the black cage holds a sentient creature (Intelligence 5 or higher), the door is closed, and the command word is spoken, each being within it suffers an enervation spell. If any fail their save, the black cage fires a cone of energy (equivalent to the red beam from a prismatic spray spell, except that it does 1d6 damage for every negative level inflicted upon the prisoners, maximum 15d6) from the black cage in a direction of the user's choice. The black cage may be used up to five times per day. If a trapped creature dies from negative levels, the black cage's user also suffers an enervation spell. This is an evil item; any good creature carrying using it gains a negative level. Although this level never results in actual level loss, it remains for as long the black cage is held or carried and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). Caster Level: 13th;
Mace (Light).COPY=Mace of the Iron One
Mace of the Iron One.MOD					COST:18305	WT:6		EQMOD:PLUS1W.Unholy (Weapon/Melee)	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	SPROP:This iron idol in the shape of an armored goblin functions as an +1 unholy light mace that can be used as a divine focus by any being that worships the Iron One or other members of the goblin pantheon. As the goblins of Grodd lack the spells necessary to create these items, it is likely that this was acquired before their extradimensional imprisonment or was somehow created by the Iron One himself. Caster Level: 7th;
