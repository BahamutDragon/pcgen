# Feat Name			Type
#
# NOTES:

# Because of shortcomings in the system Spell Reprieve, Arcane Transformation are not capable of doing anything other than providing
# visual references. The Spells tab will still restrict casters from selecting spells on their prohibited lists.
#
# Arcane Transformation and Item Reprieve both cannot be selected more than one, but MULT needs to be set to YES so that the CHOOSE will fire.
# So an additional pre-req was added such that the feat cannot already be on the character's list. This does cause the feats to appear in red text
# on the display but beyond the visual affectation they work correctly.
#
# Because the SPELLKNOWN and CHOOSE:SPELLS tags are incompatible with each it is not possible to add a selected spell to the character's
# known spells "programmatically" as is done with similar things like the Olin Gisir's Word of Dispel.
# It is possible to apply %CHOICE to the SPELLKNOWN tag, but this throws an error and then the spell added is literally "%CHOICE" 
# It is possible to apply %LIST to the SPELLKNOWN tag, but this throws an error and fails

CATEGORY=FEAT|Arcane Manipulation.MOD		SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:When you prepare spells, you can break down up to three existing arcane spell slots to create a specified number of lower-level spell slots (A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 level for this purpose, so a 1st-level spell slot could be broken into two 0-level spell slots.) The sum of the levels of all the new spell slots must equal the level of the original. The number of spell slots you can create in this manner is otherwise unlimited. Spell slots that you break down into multiple lower-level slots remain that way until the next time you prepare spells, at which time you can choose to restore your spell slots to normal or break them up again.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Arcane Transformation.MOD		SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:Choose a school of magic that was previously prohibited to you because of your arcane specialization. You can now learn and cast spells from that school normally, as if you were not a specialist wizard. You can select this feat only once. The school you choose must be one for which you have already taken both the Spell Reprieve and the Item Reprieve feats.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Channel Charge.MOD			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:When you use a spell triggered item with charges (such as a wand or a staff), you can make a Use Magic Device check (DC15 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, you can sacrifice a spell slot or a prepared spell instead of using a charge. The spell slot or prepared spell sacrificed must be one level higher than the level of the desired effect from the item. If the check fails, both your spell slot (or prepared spell) and 1 charge from the item are expended.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Cormanthyran Moon Magic.MOD	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	DESC:When you cast a spell under moonlight, your effective caster level increases by 2. This feat provides no benefits when the moon is not visible (during the day, underground, during a new moon, or the like).
CATEGORY=FEAT|Craft Scepter.MOD				SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You can create a scepter that holds any spell of 7th level or lower that you know. Unlike a magic wand, a scepter can contain up to two spells, each of which has a cost in charges to use. Both spell effects draw from a common pool of charges, so they can be used in any combination. Crafting a scepter takes one day for each 1,000gp in its base price. The base price of a scepter is its caster level X the spell level X 750gp for the highest-level spell included, plus the caster level X the spell level X 375gp for the second spell, if any. To craft a scepter, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this amount. A new created scepter has 50 charges. Any scepter that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty units of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Familiar Concentration.MOD	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:When you cast a spell requiring concentration, you can designate your familiar as the "concentrator." At any time during the spell's duration, you can hand over control of it to your familiar as a free action, provided that the creature is within 5 feet of you and its Intelligence score is at least 10 + the level of the spell. The familiar then concentrates to maintain and direct the spell just as you would. You cannot take back control of a spell once you have transferred it to your familiar.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Godsight.MOD					SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You gain the following spell-like abilities, each usable three times per day: Detect Evil, Detect Magic, Detect Poison, Detect Undead, Read Magic. Your caster level equals your character level. When you take this feat, you can choose Detect Chaos, Detect Good, or Detect Law instead of Detect Evil. You can take this feat only as a 1st-level character.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Greenbond Summoning.MOD		SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You are learned in a long-forgotten manner of summoning once practiced by the Eaerlanni elves of the High Forest. Creatures answering your call are automatically imbued with the powers of the forest. &nl; [Benefit] All animals that you summon using SUMMON NATURE'S ALLY aquire the GREENBOUND template (see page 173) for as long as the summoning spell lasts.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Item Reprieve.MOD				SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:Choose one of the schools of magic that was previously prohibited to you because of your arcane specialization. You now can use spell completion and spell trigger magic items from that school normally, as if you were not a specialist wizard. The school you select must be one for which you have already taken the Spell Reprieve feat.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Jergal's Pact.MOD				SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You gain a +2 bonus on saves to resist gaining negative level or to remove them. If the effect that bestowed a negative level allows a Fortitude save to remove it, you can choose to attempt it after only 1 hour. (You can also choose to wait the usual amount of time before attempting the save.)
CATEGORY=FEAT|Multilingual.MOD				SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:You know three more languages than you normally would. Your choice for these extra tongues are not restricted to your racial or regional list of bonus languages, though you still can't select secret languages such as Druidic unless you belong to the race or class in question. Furthermore, Speak Language is always a class skill for you, and you receive a +2 bonus on all Decipher Script checks. You can take this feat only as a 1st-level character.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Netherese Battle Curse.MOD	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	DESC:By giving up an arcane spell slot or prepared spell before making an attack roll, you can perform a battle curse as a melee attack. You gain a bonus on the attack roll equal to the level of the spell or spell slot so sacrificed. If your attack hits, the target must succeed on a Will save (DC10 + level of the spell or slot expended + your CHA modifier) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 minute. The effects of multiple battle curses don't stack, and any foe that successfully resists your battle curse cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. Any effect that dispels or removes a curse eliminates the battle curse. Your caster level equals your character level for this purpose. 
CATEGORY=FEAT|Servant of the Fallen.MOD		SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:You can name a dead god as your patron deity and still receive your cleric spells normally. In addition, you can call upon the universal remnant of your deity's power once per day to gain a +1 luck bonus on any single die roll. You can also be raised or resurrected normally.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Spell Reprieve.MOD			SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Choose a spell from one of your prohibited schools of a level that you can cast. You can now learn and prepare that spell normally. You can take this feat multiple times, each time choosing a new spell from any of your prohibited schools.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Trapmaster.MOD				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:The bonus for your trap sense ability increases by 4. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on all Disable Device checks.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Wounding Spell.MOD			SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:When affected by this feat, a spell deals damage to a creature also inflicting a bleeding wound that does not heal normally. On each subsequent round, the victim looses 1 hit point at the beginning of your turn. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped with a Heal check (DC equal to the spell's save DC or the save DC it would other have in the case of a spell with no save), a Cure spell, or a Heal spell. You cannot apply this feat to a spell that does not deal damage (such as Charm Person or Baleful Polymorph). A Wounding spell occupies a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Spell Mantle.MOD				SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:You can use a standard action to activate a particular contingent spell you carry as a spell-like ability, even if the conditions specified for its activation have not been met.
