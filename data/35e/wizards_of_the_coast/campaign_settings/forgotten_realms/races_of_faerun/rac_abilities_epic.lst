###Block: Elven High Mage
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Elven High Mage ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven High Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:The elven high mage gains no proficiencies in weapons or armor.
Spells Per Day/Spells Known		KEY:Elven High Mage ~ Spells Per Day/Spells Known	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven High Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Starting at 1st level and every other elven high mage level thereafter (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th), the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. If already an epic spellcaster, the character gains only the benefit noted under the Spells entry for that epic class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit that a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an elven high mage, the player must decide to which class to add the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.
Seed Affinity				KEY:Elven High Mage ~ Seed Affinity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven High Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:The elven high mage's studies have provided insight into the finer points of epic spell creation. Whenever this class feature is attained (at 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 8th levels), the elven high mage chooses an epic spell seed from the list in Chapter 2 of the Epic Level Handbook. The base Spellcraft DC for epic spells created with this seed is two lower, so the elven high mage can achieve powerful epic spells at lower levels. For example, an elven mage who chooses the banish seed (normally DC 27) will gain quicker access to all epic spells that use the banish seed, because the base Spellcraft DC will be 25, not 27, and the elven mage will be able to achieve a given effect two levels earlier than other epic spellcasters.

Mythal Invention				KEY:Elven High Mage ~ Mythal Invention			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven High Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Whenever the elven high mage attains this class feature (at 2nd, 4th, 7th, and 9th levels), she may develop a single epic spell for 75%% of the normal development cost in gold, time, and experience points. The elven high mage doesn't have to develop an epic spell right away, but if she attains this class feature again before she develops an epic spell, the previous benefit is lost. For example, an elven high mage who attains a mythal invention at 2nd level must use it before 4th level, when the next mythal invention is available.
