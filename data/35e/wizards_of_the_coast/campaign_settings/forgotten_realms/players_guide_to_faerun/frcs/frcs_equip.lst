# Equipment Name		Unique Key			Type				Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Alchemical Sleep Gas					TYPE:Special Items	COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SPROP:This liquid evaporates quickly when exposed to air, creating a temporary, mildly toxic cloud that puts living creatures to sleep. You can throw a flask of sleep gas as a grenadelike weapon. It has a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit (splashes have no effect because the gas dissipates instantly), a living target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or fall asleep for 1 minute. After 1 minute, the target must make another Fortitude save (DC 15) or sleep 1d4 additional minutes. The sleep gas affects creatures that are immune to magical sleep effects but not creatures that are immune to poison. Spells and effects that cancel or counter poisons (such as neutralize poison) are effective against the gas. The gas affects only one creature of Small or larger size. The gas affects all creatures of Tiny or smaller size in the 5-foot square where it strikes. Note: A sleeping creature is helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens the creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening the creature is a standard action. The Alchemy DC to make alchemical sleep gas is 25.
Disappearing Ink						TYPE:Special Items	COST:5	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SPROP:After being used to write a message, this blue or red ink vanishes from view at the end of an hour (though ink can be made, at greater expense, that will disappear after longer periods, such as a day, a tenday, or a month). Heat (such as a candle flame) applied to the writing surface makes the ink appear again. A Spot or Search check (DC 20) reveals traces of the writing. The Alchemy DC to make disappearing ink is 15.
Herb, Cassil		KEY:Cassil (Herb)		TYPE:Special Items.Herb	COST:1	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SPROP:Cassil is a small shrub similar to a mustard plant. Its seeds are ground into a fine, tasteless powder that suppresses male fertility. Men who want to avoid fathering children use this herb. A male humanoid who eats about a teaspoon of cassil is rendered infertile for a period of 3d4 days, although it requires about an hour before the herb takes effect. Stories abound of disloyal courtiers dosing their kings or lords in order to prevent the conception of a royal heir. Using either the Heal skill or Profession (herbalist), the effects can be detected with a DC 15 check and countered with a DC 20 check.
Herb, Nararoot		KEY:Nararoot (Herb)	TYPE:Special Items.Herb	COST:0.2	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SPROP:Nararoot is a black, woody tuber with a licoricelike flavor. Shavings steeped in hot water make a strong tea that renders a woman infertile for d4+2 days. Chewed raw, the root tastes unpleasant, but the effects are more potent, lasting 2d4+4 days. Women who do not wish to become pregnant use nararoot. Using either the Heal skill or Profession (herbalist), the effects can be detected with a DC 15 check and countered with a DC 20 check.
Powderhorn							TYPE:Special Items	COST:35	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SPROP:This waterproof horn holds 2 pounds of smokepowder.
Powderkeg							TYPE:Special Items	COST:250	WT:20		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SPROP:This is a normal wooden keg that holds 15 pounds (240 ounces) of smokepowder.
Scentbreaker						TYPE:Special Items	COST:5	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	SPROP:This small bag contains either a collection of aromatic herbs or a strongly scented alchemical mixture. Either version can confound any creature's sense of smell. You can toss the bag as a grenadelike weapon with a range increment of 10 feet, or you can scatter the contents someplace where a creature tracking by scent will come across it. (It covers an area 5 feet square.) Once scattered, the contents remain potent for 1 hour. A creature can sniff the bag's contents from a direct hit, from a splash, or from sniffing the area where the contents were scattered. If struck by a direct hit, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or lose its scent ability for 1 minute. After the minute is up, the creature must make a second Fortitude save (DC 18) or lose its scent ability for another hour. Being splashed or sniffing the scattered contents has the same effect, but the save DC is 15. A direct hit or splash affects only one creature of Small or larger size. The contents affect all creatures of Tiny or smaller size in the 5- foot square where a bag of scentbreaker strikes. Note: The Alchemy DC to make scentbreaker is 15. If you have 5 or more ranks in Profession (herbalist), you get a +2 synergy bonus on checks to craft it.
