Bedine Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Bedine			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Bedine		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Bedine]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Anauroch]																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.106	DESC:The Bedine are nomads of Anauroch who migrated from Zakhara via a portal shortly after the fall of Netheril in -339 DR and intermingled with a handful of Netherese survivors. The Bedine retained the spoken language of their ancestors, Midani, but lost all knowledge of the written word. Centuries later, traders from the surrounding lands sought them out and introduced the alphabet of Thorass. The Bedine adopted the gods of the Netherese and continue to venerate At'ar (Amaunator, a dead Netherese deity reborn as Lathander), Elah (Selune), Kozah (Talos), N'asr (some say Cyric, some say Kelemvor), Shaundakul (actually Beshaba), and many little gods as well. The Bedine are found primarily in the southern, sandy reaches of Anaruroch known as the Sword. They have brown hued skin, brown eyes, black or brown hair and are of average height and weight for Faerunian humanoids. Those rare instances of blue eyes or blonde hair are marked as having "outlander blood".
Calishite Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Calishite		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Calishite	PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Calishite]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Amn],[PREREGION:Calimshan],[PREREGION:Lake of Steam],[PREREGION:Nelanther Isles],[PREREGION:Shaar],[PREREGION:Tethyr],[PREREGION:Tharsult],[PREREGION:Underdark (Old Shanatar)],[PREREGION:Western Heartlands]																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.10		DESC:These humans, descended from the slaves of Calimshan's ancient genie lords, form the primary racial stock of the Border Kingdoms, the Lake of Steam cities, the Nelanther Isles, and Calimshan. Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. They regard themselves as the rightful rulers of all lands south and west of the Sea of Fallen Stars, and they look upon northern cultures as short-lived barbarian kingdoms barely worthy of notice. Most Calishites seek nothing more than a lifestyle of comfort and the respect of their peers.
Chondathan Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Chondathan		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Chondathan	PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Chondathan]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Aglarond],[PREREGION:Altumbel],[PREREGION:Cormyr],[PREREGION:Dalelands],[PREREGION:Damara],[PREREGION:Dragon Coast],[PREREGION:Great Dale],[PREREGION:Impiltur],[PREREGION:Moonsea],[PREREGION:Nelanther Isles],[PREREGION:Sembia],[PREREGION:Silverymoon],[PREREGION:Turmish],[PREREGION:Vast],[PREREGION:Vilhon Reach],[PREREGION:Waterdeep],[PREREGION:Western Heartlands],[PREREGION:Wizards' Reach]			SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:Descended from the natives of the Vilhon Reach, these hardy folk have spread to settle most of the western and central Inner Sea region and much of the Western Heartlands. Chondathans form the primary racial stock of Altumbel, Cormyr, the southern Dalelands, the Dragon Coast, the Great Dale, Hlondeth and both shores of the Vilhon Reach, the Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, Sembia, and Sespech. They are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. The Chondathan domination of central Faerun came about largely by virtue of extensive trade and settlement rather than by force of arms. Many Chondathans are merchants of one sort or another, and they are not afraid to take risks, travel, or settle new lands.
Chultan Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Chultan			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Chultan		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Chultan]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Chult],[PREREGION:Samarach],[PREREGION:Tashalar],[PREREGION:Thindol]																																																									SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.106	DESC:The jungles of Chult are home to tall, ebony-skinned humans who migrated north to the Chultan peninsula millennia ago from a great island in the southern seas of Abeir-Toril southeast of Maztica and southwest of Zakhara. Two millennia ago, there were many tribes in Chult, although the Chultans and the Eshowe were the most powerful and influential. A bloody war raged between the Chultans and Eshowe from 1800 years ago to 1500 years ago, ending only after the latter group was wiped out. The Eshowe were destroyed after unleashing a great evil known as the Shadow Giant onto their enemies, only to see it turn on them after being repulsed by the Chultan defenders. In the centuries that followed, unchecked by any rivals, the Chultans assimilated most of the remaining tribes of the peninsula into a single Chultan culture, sharing a common language and somewhat uniform social structure. Chultans, who speak Chultan, adopted the Draconic alphabet before the founding of Mezro and spread it to the other Chultan tribes. The primary god of the Chultans is Ubtao, who is said to have brought their ancestors to the peninsula the now call home thousands of years ago and have founded the great city of Mezro in -2637 DR. The remnants of the Eshowe venerate Eshowdow, a dark shadow of Ubtao subverted by Shar.
Damaran Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Damaran			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Damaran		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Damaran]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Aglarond],[PREREGION:Altumbel],[PREREGION:Damara],[PREREGION:Great Dale],[PREREGION:Impiltur],[PREREGION:Moonsea],[PREREGION:Narfell],[PREREGION:Thesk],[PREREGION:Vaasa],[PREREGION:Vast]																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:Proud and stubborn, these humans were born from some scattered remnants of Narfell's fall-primarily groups of Nars, Rashemis, and Sossrims who struggled to survive while waves of Chondathan emigrants settled in the lands of the Easting Reach. These four populations gradually coalesced into a new ethnic group that now makes up the primary racial stock of Damara, Impiltur, Thesk, and the Vast. Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, and their eye color varies widely, though brown is most common. Damarans see the world in stark contrasts-unspeakable evil (often stemming from the hubris of long-fallen empires) opposed by indomitable and uncompromising good. Most Damarans are farmers, loggers, or miners in a harsh and unforgiving land.
Durpari Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Durpari			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Durpari		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Durpari]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Golden Water],[PREREGION:Mulhorand]																																																														SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.106	DESC:The Durpari are the relatively short, dark-skinned inhabitants of Durpar, Estagund, Veldorn, and Var the Golden. The Durpari have dwelt along the shores of the Golden Water since before the rise of the Imaskari empire. The fall of Imaskar precipitated the fall of the Durpari kingdoms and two millennia of barbarism. During this period, the Mulan of Mulhorand often slaughtered or enslaved the Durpari tribes. In -623 DR, the first Durpari kingdoms after the fall of Imaskar arose along the shores of the Golden Water, as Mulan influence over the region ebbed in the face of the burgeoning threat from Narfell and Raumathar. With the exception of Estagund, which was briefly conquered by the armies of Dambrath during the reign of Reinhar I in 551 DR, the Dupari have remained independent ever since, trading among themselves and with their neighbors. The Durpari speak a language of the same name- derived from a mixture of Draconic, Mulhorandi, and Rauric- and employ the Thorass alphabet brought back from the west. The Dupari venerate a small pantheon of deities known collectively as the Adama, and thought to include Selune, Oghma, Gond, Torm, and Waukeen.
Ffolk Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Ffolk			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Ffolk		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Ffolk]			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Moonshae Isles]																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.106	DESC:The native inhabitants of the Moonshae Isles call themselves the Ffolk, although only faint vestiges of the original human tribes who bore that name still remain. Today, the Ffolk are essentially an isolated group of Tethyrians, descended from a large wave of immigration from the Western Heartlands in 467 DR. The Original Ffolk had already conceded the northern Moonshae isles to the Illuskans centuries before the arrival of the Tethyrians, yet the Illuskans are still considered the invaders by the Ffolk. Unlike their mainland cousins, the Tethyrian Ffolk speak Illuskan, but they still employ the Thorass script. They are governed by a strong druidical tradition.
Gur Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Gur			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Gur		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Gur]			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Sword Coast],[PREREGION:Western Heartlands]																																																													SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.106	DESC:The Gur, also known as "Selune's Children" or "the people of the highway," are the nomads of the Western Heartlands. Most Gurs are members of extended family groups that travel together from settlement to settlement in motley caravans selling cheap cast-offs and working odd jobs. Others have settles in the poorest quarters of cities such as Baldur's Gate, Elturel, and Irieabor, where they struggle to survive in the face of ancient prejudices. Among those few scholars who have studied their culture, the Gurs are thought to be primarily of Rashemi descent. Although they have certainly intermingled with members of other ethnic groups, they strongly resemble the natives of Rashmen. As fragments of lore dating back to the erection of the Standing Stone refer to the nomadic Gurs, it is thought that they fled their ancient homeland during or immediately after the cataclysmic battle between Raumathar and Narfell. Speakers of an ancient dialect of Rashemi among themselves, the honor-obsessed Gurs employ Thorass alphabet and speak Chondathan with non-Gurs. Many of Selune's Children are unusually gifted oracles and find employment as soothsayers and diviners. In addition to the goddess of the moon, many prophetically inclined Gurs venerate Savras. Their secretive faith may in large part account for the continued survival of his faith during his many years of imprisonment.
Halruaan Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Halruaan		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Halruaan		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Halruaan]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Halruaa],[PREREGION:Nimbral]																																																															SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.106	DESC:Descended from the mighty Netherese wizards, Halruuans have a love and fascination with magic. It permeates their lives and provides them a standard of living found nowhere else in Faerun. Most modern halruaans have dark hair and skin in any shade from ruddy to deep olive though an occasional paler skinned child is born. Eye color ranges from black to chocolate brown to deep green. Halruaan men average about 5 feet 9 inches tall and women about 2 inches shorter.
Illuskan Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Illuskan		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Illuskan		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Illuskan]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Dambrath],[PREREGION:Moonshae Isles],[PREREGION:Nelanther Isles],[PREREGION:North],[PREREGION:Silverymoon],[PREREGION:Sword Coast],[PREREGION:Uthgardt Tribesfolk],[PREREGION:Waterdeep]																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:The seagoing, warlike people of the Sword Coast, North, the Trackless Sea, and the Dessarin river valley, Illuskans are tall, fair-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes. Among the islands of the Trackless Sea and Icewind Dale, their hair color tends toward blond, red, or light brown. On the mainland south of the Spine of the World, however, raven-black hair is most common. Illuskans are proud, particularly of their ability to survive in the harsh environment of their northern homelands, and they regard most southerners as weak and decadent. Illuskans make their livings as farmers, fishers, miners, sailors, raiders, skalds, and runecasters.
Imaskari Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Imaskari		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Imaskari		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Imaskari]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Golden Water],[PREREGION:Mulhorand]																																																														SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.107	DESC:The Imaskari are the legendary inhabitants of the lands now swallowed by the Raurin Desert and the Plains of the Purple Dust. Vilified by the Mulan, the artificers of Imaskar were mighty wizards who built great portals to other worlds in order to carry off thousands of slaves from distant planes. Little is known of the Imaskari, except what the Mulan chose to preserve of their ancient masters. At one point the Imaskari Empire held sway from the Endless Wastes to the Golden Water and from the Alamber Sea to the very frontiers of Kara-Tur. Ruins of tremendous antiquity is the Plains of Purple Dust may be the remains of Imaskari cities. The Imaskari spoke Roushoum, a precursor of such varied tongues as Durpari, the Rautic family (Chessentan, Mulhorani,and Untheric), Raumvira, and the various Tuigan dialects. The Imaskari alphabet has wholly fallen out of use, and is only found inscribed on a few ancient artifacts and the walls of Imaskari ruins.

The lantanna worship Gond and pioneer technological solutions to problems rather than magical. They have large green eyes, copper hair, and parchment-colored skin.
Maztican Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Maztican		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Maztican		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Maztican]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Sword Coast],[PREREGION:Waterdeep]																																																														SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.107	DESC:Maztica is a far-off land that lies west of Faerun, beyond even fabled Evermeet. Tethyrian explorers from Amn discovered Maztica just over a decade ago, and Maztican immigrants are now found in very small numbers in Amn, Baldur's Gate, and Waterdeep. Faerunians lump all inhabitants of Maztica into one group, nut in truth there are seven known human ethnicities in that land: the Azuposi, the Dog People, the Green Folk, the Metahel, the Nahopca, the Nexalans, and the Payits. The Nexalans are the only group to have journeyed east to Faerun, so all Faerun-dwelling Mazticans are speakers of Nexalan, the language of the nations of Pezelac, Huacli, Kultaka, and Nexal. The Nexalan tongue is written using the Draconic alphabet. Nexlans are relatively tall, with long, lean physiques and beardless, angular faces. Nexalans are generally reddish-bronze of hue.
Mulan Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Mulan			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Mulan		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Mulan]			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Altumbel],[PREREGION:Chessenta],[PREREGION:Mulhorand],[PREREGION:Thay],[PREREGION:Unther],[PREREGION:Wizards' Reach]																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:Members of this ethnic group have dominated the eastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars since the fall of ancient Imaskar. At various times in their long history, they have made up at least the ruling elite of Ashanath, Chessenta, the Eastern Shaar, Murgh'm, Rashemen, Semphar, Thay, Thesk, and the Wizards' Reach cities south of the Yuirwood. Mulan are generally tall, slim, and sallow skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but all nobles and many other Mulan routinely shave off all their hair. As a race, Mulan are arrogant, conservative, and convinced of their cultural superiority over the rest of Faerun.

Further details of their history may be found in the descriptions of the Damarans and the Rashemi.Nars are short and stocky, with darkly tanned skin tones and straight, raven black hair, usually worn to the shoulders. They are some of the finest horsemen in Faerun, and famed breeders of the legendary Nar heavy horse. Although they once spoke Narfelli, a forgotten tongue strongly influenced by Abyssal, the Nars now speak Damaran tongue common to lands near the Easting Reach as well as a smattering of Common. As most Nars can be considered barbarians, few can read or write, but those that do employ the Dethek runes adopted by speakers of Damaran.
Netherese Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Netherese		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Netherese	PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Netherese]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Shadovar]																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.108	DESC:Four small groups of pureblooded Netherese are believed to survive in the present day. The Marsh Drovers of the Farsea Marshes are thought to be descendants of Anauria who were never absorbed by the Chondathan inhabitants of Cormyr. The Tunlar barbarians of the Plains of Tun are believed to be descendants of the Rengarth barbarians (cousins of the Low Netherese) of southern Netheril. The nomadic barbarians of the Ride north of the Moonsea are believed to be descendants of the Angardt barbarians of northern Netheril (also cousins of the Low Netherese). Finally, the fourth floating city of High Netheril, known as Shade, survived the fall of Netheril by vanishing into the Plane of Shadow. Shade reappered in 1372 DR, after generations of warfare with the malaugrym in the shadow-plane. Shade now rests on the northern shore of the Shadow Sea, which was once the Shoal of Thirst.
Rashemi Ethnicity		KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Rashemi			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Rashemi		PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Rashemi]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Aglarond],[PREREGION:Hordelands],[PREREGION:Rashemen],[PREREGION:Thay],[PREREGION:Thesk],[PREREGION:Wizards' Reach]																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.16		DESC:These humans are tough, sturdy, and well adapted to life in the harsh and dangerous northeastern reaches of Faerun. They are descended from the nomadic tribes that won the Orcgate Wars and built the empire of Raumathar. Not only do Rashemis dominate Rashemen and Thay, they also form significant minorities in Aglarond, the Endless Wastes, Thesk, and the Wizards' Reach region. Rashemis tend to be short, stout, and muscular, and they usually have dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick, black hair. They cherish their strong ties to their land, appreciating its beauty while respecting its harshness. They display little of the arrogance that marks other groups whose ancestors once ruled empires.
Raumviran Ethnicity	KEY:Human Ethnicity ~ Raumviran		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:Human Ethnicity.Faerun Ethnicity		TEMPLATE:Ethnicity ~ Raumviran	PREMULT:1,[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,TYPE.Faerun Ethnicity],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Human Ethnicity ~ Raumviran]		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Hordelands]																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.108	DESC:Descended from the inhabitants of the great empire of Raumathar, the Raumvirans retain little of their former glory. Their history is described under the Damaran and Rashemi ethnic groups. In the present day, Raumvirans are concentrated along the shores of the Lake of Mists and the city of Almorel. Physically, Raumvirans bear a close resemblance to the Rashemi, indicative of centuries of close ties between the two groups. Although taller on average than their western neighbors, the Raumvirans are also generally stout and muscular, with dark eyes and thick black hair. Raumvirans are generally of lighter hue than Rashemi, evidence of significant Sossrim heritage dating back to the height of their long-fallen empire. Members of this ethnic group speak Raumvira, a tongue closely related to Rashemi, Dwarven, and a northern dialect of Imaskari. Raumvirans employ an alphabet of Dethek runes taught to them before the founding of Raumathar by the Siremun dwarves of the Firepeaks, a range of mountains to the east of the Lake of Mists.

Conquered by the armies of Calimshan at the height of the Shoon Empire,the Shaarans of the eastern grasslands reverted to their nomadic ways once the Shoon Empire collapsed, while those who dwelt along the shores of the Shining Sea and the Lake of Steam settled in cities and founded such realms as Lapaliiya and the ever-changing Border Kingdoms. Today, Shaarans are found as far west as Calimshan and as far north as the Vilhon Reach. The inhabitants of Sespech are largely of Shaaran descent, having been brought north to serve in Jhaamdath's armies centuries ago. Speakers of Shaaran employ an alphabet of Dethek runes, adopted from the gold dwarf traders of the Great Rift before the rise of the Shoon Empire. If there ever was a Shaaran pantheon, it was long ago subsumed by the more powerful Jhamdaathan and Calishite cultures. Little record exist of Shaaran culture before it was assimilated by its more powerful neighbors, for Shaarans have long maintained a nomadic way of life and an oral history.

During the course of the people's 1700 year exile from Toril, they have battled the Malaugrym and the other shadowy horrors of the realm, becoming more attuned to the Plane of Shadow with each generation and later Shadowfell for a short time, and are thus now known as Shadovar.

Similar in appearance to the Tuigan, they are yellowish-bronze in hue, with black hair and broad, flat features. At its height, the Shou empire extended as far west as the eastern shore of Brightstar Lake. Today, Shou traders are rarely seen west of Semphar, although their emperor has recently established an embassy in Elversult and made use of a ship-sized portal that opens somewhere on the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Shou worship a pantheon of deities known as the Celestial Bureaucracy and employ the Draconic alphabet to represent the Shou language.

With skin as pallid as snow and hair with the fine, silver tint of an icicle, the Sossrims have completely adapted to their arctic environment. Sossrim speak Damaran and use the Dethek runes. They are believed to venerate the gods of the Faerunian pantheon, although the worship of a relatively benign aspect of Auril seems the be predominant. During the Orcgate Wars, the Sossrims fought in the armies of Mulhorand alongside the Raumvirans and the Rashemi. After the followers of Gruumsh were defeated, the Sosstim retreated to their northen land, where they established the isolated kingdom of Sossal. The Sossrims briefly fell under the sway of Raumathar at the height of that empire, but they have otherwise retained their independence. Before the retreat of the Great Glacier, Sossrim traders were seen as far south as northern Impiltur, but now they rarely venture beyond Vaasa or the northern reaches of Damara, Narfell, and Rashmen.

The Talfir were the original human inhabitants of the Chionthar river valley in the Western Heartlands. Speakers of Talfiric, a long-lost human tongue based on the Draconic alphabet, the Talfir gradually disappeared over a thousand years ago, their culture overwhelmed by refugees from Low Netheril, Calishite settlers from the south, and Chondathan settlers from the Dragon Coast. Several deities of the Faerunian pantheon are believed to have been worshiped by the Talfir, including Tempus, who vanquished the Netherese god of war. The Talfir left little in the way of ruins or artifacts, although Irieabor lies atop the ancient crypt of the Talfir monarch known as Verraketh the Shadowking, who mastered shadow magic. Talis, a ruined city of the Talfir, lies in ruins along the banks of the River Reaching in the depths of the Reaching Woods.

As with all things, the saurian civilization eventually collapsed and their human slaves won their freedom. However, many members of this black-haired, olive-skinned race took to venerating the snaked they once served, leading to the rise of the yuan-ti. Others, however, turned away from their dark masters, seeking to forge their own realms on the peninsula between the Shining Sea and the Great Sea. Today Tashalan culture is largely confined to the middle of the Vhultan peninsula and the isle of Tharsult. Over the centuries the Chultan tribes drove the Talshalans out of the Jungles of Chult, the Halruaans and the Dambrathan drow assimilated the native Tashalan cultures of those lands, and the yuan-ti enslaved those Tashalans who contested their control of the Mhair and Black Jungles. Most Tashalans are natives of Tashalar or the realms of Samarach, Thindol, or Tharsult. Tashalan traders may be found in Calimshan, cities on the shore of the Lake of Steam, and Lapaliiya, as well as Halruaa, Dambrath, and Luiren. Tashalans speak Tashalan and employ the Dethek alphabet. They venerate both the Faerunian pantheon and the gods of the yuan-ti, with the followers of Talona and Savras being most prominent.

This unique background makes Tethyrians among the most tolerant, though fiercely independent, ethnic groups in Faerun. They inhabit a vast territory stretching from Calimshan to Silverymoon, and from the Sea of Swords to the Sea of Fallen Stars. Tethyrians are of medium build and height, with dusky skin that grows fairer the farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians are proud of their diverse heritage and protective of their freedom, so they tend to distrust powerful kingdoms and empires.

Closely related to the inhabitants of Kara-Tur, tribal members are yellowish-bronze in hue, with black hair and broad, flat features. Each tribe has its own dialect, derived in varying degrees from the old empires of Shou, Raumvira, and Imaskari, each of which conquered or extended its influence over the Endless Wastes at its height. The tribes of the Endless Wastes adopted the alphabet of Thorass from traders passing eastwards along the Golden Way to Kara-Tur long ago. The tribes are believed to worship Akadi, the elemental deity of air, and Grumbar, the elemental deity of earth, as well as several beast totems (Horse and Tiger). Since the defeat of the great Tuigan horde in 1360 DR, members of the Tuigan tribe have been found in small numbers in western lands such as Semphar, Thay, Thesk, Narfell, and Rashemen. It is this group of immigrants who are best known to the inhabitants of Faerun.

This migration in turn displaced the native Turami, who were driven westward along the southern coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars until they reached the coastal basin now known as Turmish. Generally tall and muscular, with dark mahogany skin, flat faces, and curly hair, the Turami are the primary inhabitants of Turmish, although they form minority populations in Chessenta, Unther, and Mulhorand as well. Speakers of Turmic, the Turami adopted the Thorass alphabet from Calishite and Chondathan traders. No historical evidence exists suggesting the existence of a Turami pantheon distinct from the Faerunian pantheon commonly venerated today, although that does not mean that one did not exist. Turmish, the homeland of most Turami, dates back to the founding of Alaghon in -37 DR.

Speakers of Uluik, a tongue that only in recent centuries acquired a written form based on the Thorass alphabet, the Ulutiuns are divided into two major groups. The Sea of Moving Ice, the Ice Peak, and the Cold Run (as the icy reaches of the northernmost Sword Coast are sometimes known) are home to the Ice Hunters, the westernmost group of Ulutiuns. Believed to predate the arrival of both the Netherese and the Illuskans, the Ice Hunters venerate nature spirits and are led by shamans, not unlike the more warlike Uthgardt tribes and the barbarians of Icewind Dale. In the east, the Great Glacier is home to the majority of Ulutiuns, including the Iulutiuns, the Angulutiuns, and the Nakulutiuns. They favor hide armor and weapons such as battleaxes, garnoks, hand axes, harpoons, iuaks, light picks, nets, ritiiks, shortbows, throwing axes, and tridents.

Refugees from the Netherese survivor states of Asram, Anauria, and Hlondath fled east toward the Moonsea to found realms such as Teshar (which was founded in -87 DR and fell in 479 DR) Yulash, and Northkeep (which fell in 400 DR). In later centuries Chondathan immigrants from Sembia, the Dalelands, and the Vast joined the descendants of these early settlements and established the Moonsea city-states of Zhentil Keep, Hulburg, Melvaunt, Mulmaster, Phlan, and Thentia. Vaasa proper was settled from the Moonsea region after the Great Glacier began its retreat, a couple hundred years ago. While this ethnic group is sometimes referred to as Tesharans, Tharrans, or Yuls, the name of the last land they settled has become the name by which they are most commonly known in other lands. Vaasans are typically fair to olive-skinned with dark hair and thick beards. They speak Damaran and employ the Dethek alphabet, a legacy of long-standing trade ties with the nations of Impiltur and Damara. Vaasans venerate most gods of the Faerunian pantheon, although Bane and, to a lesser extent, Cyric and Auril receive the bulk of their prayers.

Zakhara is considered a continent in its own right, not unlike Faerun or Kara-Tur, although all three continents are physically connected. The Land of Fate is home to the Zakharans, relatively short, brown-skinned, dark-haired humans who speak Midani. Zakharans born in the Land of Fate are rarely seen outside their homeland, although Zakharan traders are not unknown in the southernmost reaches of Faerun. However, at least two groups of Zakharan humans have migrated to Faerun by means of portals and are found in large numbers in the western lands in the form of the Bedine and Calishites.

Native to the mountains at the heart of the Great Glacier and other northerly regions, arctic dwarves are little known to the outside world. Many arctic dwarves are rangers, barbarians, or fighters, for they hold little interest in the spellcasting arts or godly worship. (Arctic dwarves have an ECL 2)

Renowned not only for their smithwork and craftsmanship but also for their military prowess and legendary wealth, gold dwarves have maintained their empire for millennia, unbowed by the passage of time. Averaging 4 feet tall and weighing as much as an adult human, gold dwarves are stocky and muscular. The skin of a gold dwarf is light brown or deeply tanned, and her eyes are usually brown or hazel. Both genders wear their hair long, and males (and some females) have long, carefully groomed beards and mustaches. Hair color ranges from black to gray or brown, with all shades fading to light gray as time progresses.

Like their surface-dwelling kin, gray dwarves are famed for their smithwork and craftsmanship, but unlike their brethren in the Realms Above, the duergar are grim and cheerless, living lives of endless toil. Like their gold and shield dwarf kin, the duergar have forged great empires, founding such realms as the Deepkingdom of Gracklstugh and the Steel Kingdom of Dunspeirrin in the endless darkness of the Realms Below. Averaging 4 feet tall, gray dwarves weigh nearly as much as an adult human. While other dwarves tend to be round-bodied and stoutly muscled, duergar are wide of shoulder but wiry and lean, their limbs corded with tough muscle. The skin of a gray dwarf is light or dark gray, and his eyes are dull black. Both genders are usually bald, with males having long gray beards and mustaches. Gray dwarves are consumed with bitterness, feeling their race has forever been denied what was rightfully theirs. The duergar expect and live lives of never-ending drudgery. While their work rivals that of shield and gold dwarves, they are relentless perfectionists who take no pleasure in their craftsmanship. Only cruel jokes and petty torments bring a moment's smile to most gray dwarves, and they delight in tormenting the weak and the helpless.

Renowned for their smithwork and craftsmanship, shield dwarves have endured a centuries-long decline in the face of never-ending wars with orcs, goblins, giants, and trolls. Shield dwarves are descended from the founders of Shanatar, a legendary dwarven empire that once ruled the caverns beneath modern-day Amn, Tethyr, and Calimshan. After Shanatar fell, the shield dwarves migrated north, founding kingdoms such as Ammarindar, Delzoun, Gharraghaur, Haunghdannar, Oghrann, and Sarbreen. Although those kingdoms have also largely fallen, the Stout Folk of the North endure. The Thunder Blessing has served as a welcome reprieve for the beleaguered shield dwarves, giving hope that the descendants of ancient Shanatar may one day reclaim the glory of their forebears. Taller by half a foot than their gold dwarf cousins, shield dwarves average 4 1/2 feet tall and weigh as much as an adult human. The skin of a shield dwarf is fair or lightly tanned, and her eyes are usually green or silvered blue. Both genders wear their hair long, and males (and a very few females) have long, carefully groomed beards and mustaches. Hair color ranges from light brown to red, with all shades fading to silver or white as time progresses. Shield dwarves keep to their word, whatever the cost, and are incredibly stubborn, unwilling to concede an inch unless there is absolutely no alternative. Such intransigence has enabled dwindling shield dwarf populations to hold on to ancient strongholds with just a fraction of their original defenders. However, it has also led to clan feuds and long-standing misunderstandings with other races that have sapped the strength of the Stout Folk. Shield dwarves love worked beauty, seeing the world as raw material to be forged and shaped into something more than the original.
Urdunnir Dwarf Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:DwarfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Urdunnir Dwarf			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Oldonnar],[PREREGION:Spine of the World]																																																									SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.20	DESC:Urdunnirs, sometimes known as orecutter dwarves, are a long forgotten offshoot of shield dwarves who have become one with the earth and stone. Thanks to the blessings of Dumathoin, urdunnirs can walk through earth and stone as if it were air and shape metal and stone with their hands. Many orecutter dwarves are clerics of Dumathoin, expert smiths, or expert gemcutters. The Children of Dumathoin, as they call themselves, believe that the Silent Keeper transformed their ancestors in order to create a race of dwarves who could appreciate the true beauty of the subterranean landscape without needing to destroy it in the process. They have dwelt ever since in splendid isolation in Oldonnar, the legendary Lost Kingdom of Shanatar, deep beneath the Alimir Mountains. Averaging 4 1/2 feet tall but weighing much more than an adult human, orecutter dwarves are stocky and muscular. The skin of an urdunnir is light gray, and their eyes are always silver. Both genders wear their hair long, and males (and some females) have long, carefully groomed beards and mustaches. Hair color is uniformly gray, with varying degrees of silver and black highlights. Urdunnirs see the world as a work of living beauty, walking through stone and earth much as a diver might explore the wonders of the ocean depths. The Children of Dumathoin regard themselves as particularly blessed, for they are not forced to cling to the exterior of Dumathoin's creation like other races but can wander through the heart of the world itself in an endless search to uncover the Silent Keeper's hidden secrets (gems).
Wild Dwarf Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:DwarfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Wild Dwarf				PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Chult]																																																															SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.21	DESC:Wild dwarves, who call themselves "dur Authalar" (the People), are the primitive inhabitants of the Jungles of Chult and the Mhair and Black Jungles. They have largely rejected the clanbased craft- and smith-oriented culture of their gold, gray, and shield dwarf cousins, choosing instead to live in hunting bands with ever-shifting memberships. Eschewing all trappings of civilization, wild dwarves live like beasts, engaged in an endless hunt for survival. Only those who dare the shadowy depths of Faerun's southern jungles are even aware of the existence of this barbaric dwarven subrace, for these elusive hunters keep to the depths of their woodland homes. Wild dwarves are dark-skinned, short, and stout, with dark brown eyes. Their heavily tattooed bodies are covered with grease to ward off insects and make them hard to hold. Wild dwarves wear little except their long, woven hair, which serves as adequate clothing. They plaster their hair and skin with mud to form a crude armor when going to war. Dur Authalar have more in common with the beasts of the jungle than they do with their dwarven kin, viewing life as an endless hunt and each day a struggle to kill or be killed. Wild dwarves distrust all intruders into their jungle domain and, if confronted, are apt to attack first without question. Much like the beasts they strive to emulate, wild dwarves care little about goings-on in the world at large, the doings of those who are not wild dwarves, or material possessions.

Aquatic Elf Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Aquatic Elf									PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Inner Sea],[PREREGION:Outer Sea]																																																											SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.28	DESC:Rarely encountered by the landbound races, the aquatic elves are a civilized and good-hearted people who inhabit the seas surrounding Faerun. Most aquatic elves hail from underwater cities in the Sea of Fallen Stars or in the Great Sea south of Faerun, but small settlements of this race can be found in the seas along Faerun's western coasts as well. The aquatic elves are tall, standing 6 feet or more in height. They have long limbs with strong swimming muscles, and their fingers and toes are long with thick webbing. Their most striking features are sets of gills along the collarbone and ribcage. Aquatic elves are nowhere near as thin as their landbound cousins, and their hair is usually stringy and thick, cut short for warriors but otherwise worn long. Great Sea aquatic elves have radiant skin of deep green with irregular thin brown stripes and patches. Aquatic elves from the Sea of Fallen Stars have skin in many shades of blue with white patches and stripes. Eye colors for both types of aquatic elf come in every shade seen among gold, moon, or wild elves. Their clothing is made of various undersea plants in shades of green, black, and brown, although aquatic elves usually go about lightly clad, if dressed at all, while underwater.
Avariel Elf Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Avariel Elf									PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Snow Eagle Aerie]																																																													SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.31	DESC:The avariels, or winged elves, are without a doubt the most reclusive and least numerous of the elven subraces on Faerun. Many scholars have long dismissed them as creatures of myth. In truth, small numbers of avariels still dwell in Faerun, concealed in hidden enclaves and remote regions. The most striking feature of the avariels is their soft, feathered wings. These wings have spans of anywhere from twelve to sixteen feet and are usually white, but may also be gray, brown, black, or speckled. Avariels take great pride in their wings and spend long hours grooming them. Their skin is pale, often porcelain white, with tinges of blue or faint silver. They have silverwhite or black hair, with other shades being rare but not unheard of. The avariels' eyes are rather large and more expressive than those of other elves, and they tend to be brilliant shades of blue or green. A few avariel have scintillating violet eyes as pure as amethysts. Avariels stand 5'9" tall on average, with thin, graceful limbs and angular facial features. They are the most beautiful and striking of the elven races, although too often this beauty is marred by haughtiness and condescension toward their landbound kin, whom they often pity. Avariels are even more delicate than other elves, and their movements are quick, calculated, and graceful. They prefer to wear loose fitting, diaphanous clothing that catches the wind in flight and ripples and weaves in the air. Armor is almost never worn, because it tends to weigh the avariels down and hinder their graceful motion. Avariels cannot fly while wearing heavy armor.
Drow Elf Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:CHOOSE:Subrace ~ Drow Elf Female|Subrace ~ Drow Elf Male				PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Cormanthor Drow],[PREREGION:Underdark (Menzoberranyr)]																																																							SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.34	DESC:Of the various elven subraces, none are more notorious than the drow. Descended from the original dark-skinned elven subrace called the Ssri-tel-quessir, the drow were cursed into their present appearance by the good elven deities for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have blood-red eyes, although pale eyes (so pale as to be often mistaken for white) in shades of pale lilac, silver, pink, and blue are not unknown. They also tend to be smaller and thinner than most Faerunian elves. Most drow on the surface are evil and worship Vhaeraun, but some outcasts and renegades have a more neutral attitude, and there are even groups of good drow who worship Eilistraee or other deities not of the traditional drow pantheon. Though divided by endless feuds and schisms, the drow are united in one terrible desire: they seethe with a hatred for the surface elves. By their way of reckoning, they proved themselves the superior race in the Fourth Crown War, and the fact that the Seldarine (and Corellon in particular) punished them for their success is a poison that churns in their hearts and minds eternally. They burn with hatred for the Seldarine and their coddled children, and want nothing more than to return to the surface and bring to the elves there suffering a thousand times greater than that which the drow have been forced to endure over the past ten thousand years.

They have fair skin, sometimes tinged with blue, and hair of silver-white, black, or blue; humanlike colors are somewhat rare. Their eyes are blue or green, with gold flecks. As far as the elves of Faerun go, moon elves are most like the elves presented in the Player's Handbook. Moon elves prefer to dress in rustic clothes of simple cuts and fashions that are nevertheless of fine and exquisite make. They adorn their dress with embroidered patterns, beads, and similar trappings, preferring earthen colors for everyday wear, hues that make it easy to conceal themselves in foliage. In places of safety or in times of revelry, moon elves enjoy dressing in bold colors-the more brightly colored, the better. Hair is worn in braids or ponytails, twined with wires or beads. Moon elves sometimes wear body paint or tattoos in mystic patterns, although not to extent the wild elves do.
Star Elf Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Star Elf										PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Sildeyuir],[PREREGION:Yuirwood]																																																											SOURCEPAGE:TUE p.9	DESC:The green depths of the Yuirwood hide an ancient secret long forgotten by folk beyond Aglarond's borders, and not widely known even within-the star elves, an elven subrace that retreated from Faerun to an extraplanar refuge known as Sildeyuir. Sometimes referred to in ancient texts as mithril elves, the star elves concealed the existence of their hidden kingdom for almost two thousand years, leaving behind nothing but mysterious ruins and old strong magic in the stone circles of the Yuirwood. While the star elves have kept themselves apart from the rest of Faerun for many centuries, their isolation is coming to an end. Besieged by an insidious peril from beyond the circles of the world, they face the possibility of being driven from Sildeyuir back to their ancient abode in Yuirwood.
Sun Elf Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Sun Elf										PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Evereska],[PREREGION:Evermeet],[PREREGION:Silverymoon]																																																							SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.40	DESC:The majority of Faerun's sun elves live on Evermeet, having abandoned what remained of their ancient realms during the centuries following the falls of Illefarn and Cormanthyr. They are only now returning to the mainland to reestablish their presence there. The sun elves are famed for their command of both arcane and divine magic, which exceeds that of any other living race. Works of elven high magic thousands of years old still survive in the hidden refuges of the sun elves. Sun elves are responsible for the majority of the great elven cities of legend, although other elven subraces aided the construction of many of these cities. Myth Drannor is perhaps their most famous creation, although probably not their most magnificent. Sun elf realms are the stuff legends are made of, an integral part of the history of Faerun for thousands of years. The sun elves certainly know this, for they distance themselves from nonelf races and often won't let such "lesser beings" into their lands. Sun elves have bronze skin, hair of golden blond, copper, or black, and eyes of green or gold. They favor contemplation, lore, and study over the quick games and light-hearted songs of other elves, but seem to embody the unearthly beauty, grace, and presence of the elven folk. Sun elves dress in clothing that is at the same time magnificent and understated, favoring cool colors such as blue and green. They decorate their clothes with intricate gold- or mithral-thread embroidery in exacting patterns whose subtle designs are easy to miss at first. Jewelry is simple but painstakingly crafted. Of all the elven subraces, sun elves are the most arrogant and haughty-even more so than the avariels, whose haughtiness is rooted in pity for the landbound races. Sun elves believe that they are the true elven race, the builders and the leaders of the elven realms, and that the other elven subraces fail to live up to the solemnity and dignity of their ancient stock.
Wild Elf Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Wild Elf										PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Chondalwood],[PREREGION:Elven Court],[PREREGION:Wealdath]																																																						SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.43	DESC:The wild elves of Faerun are insular and savage, and as a result are rarely seen outside their forest homes. In ages past the wild elves (or green elves, as they were more commonly known) raised great kingdoms in the forests and fielded armies to defend their homes, but with the march of time they have abandoned the trappings of civilization, becoming a furtive, reclusive race. The wild elves were always close to nature, even more so than other elves, but they have forgotten many of the high arts and lore of their people, choosing stealth and survival over building and book learning. Wild elves are stocky and strongly built for elves. Their skin tends to be dark brown, and their hair ranges from black to light brown, lightening to silvery white with age. They are quiet around anyone except their own kind, and quickly become hostile in these uncomfortable situations. Clothing is kept to a minimum among the wild elves, although they make up for this with body decoration of all sorts-tattoos, war paint, feathers, and beaded jewelry that shows a surprising streak of complex and beautiful artistry.
Wood Elf Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Wood Elf										PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Elven Court],[PREREGION:Evermeet],[PREREGION:Forest of Lethyr],[PREREGION:High Forest],[PREREGION:Wealdath],[PREREGION:Yuirwood]																																											SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.45	DESC:The wood elves are among the most numerous of Faerun's elven people, a young and confident folk who hold the old elven forest homelands in strength. Heirs to the second generation of elven nations, the wood elves see their realms as the natural successors to lands such as Eaerlann and Cormanthyr. Where the old empires expanded with strength and pride, the realms of the wood elves hope to grow with compassion and humility. The wood elves do not view their homelands as a land apart from Faerun; they understand better than their kindred that for better or worse, their fates are bound up with the fates of the humans, dwarves, and halflings around them. Also known as copper elves or sylvan elves, these people have coppery skin tinged with green, and brown, green, or hazel eyes. Hair is usually brown or black, occasionally blond or copperyred. Wood elves prefer to dress in simple clothing, similar to the moon elves but not quite so colorful. They favor a simple cut to tunic or dress, set off by common embroidery in natural designs. They are particularly fond of leather armor, and they often wear lovingly tooled and well-crafted suits even when they do not feel endangered. Their clothing, leather armor or not, is usually in dark shades of green and earth tones to better blend with their natural surroundings. They are a humble race and only rarely do they enhance their appearance with jewelry or similar accessories.

Deep Gnome Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:GnomeSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Deep Gnome			PREREGION:Underdark (Northdark)																																																																SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.49	DESC:The deep gnomes are closest thing the gnome family has to "black sheep." Many surface dwellers count the deep gnomes along with their evil neighbors, the drow and the duergar, believing them to be little more than dark reflections of the friendly rock gnomes with whom they are more familiar. In fact, the svirfneblin are just as good-hearted as their sunnier kin. However, after centuries of dealing with the everyday perils of living in the Underdark, they have become understandably distrustful of all outsiders. Compared to their better-known kin, the rock gnomes, the deep gnomes are as gray and lifeless as the subterranean caverns in which they choose to make their homes. They keep to themselves out of fear of outsiders-a fear born from numerous poor experiences with such people. To a deep gnome, the only people you can trust are other deep gnomes from your village, and preferably from your family. All others are best avoided. With strangers, most deep gnomes are sullen, reserved, and suspicious, almost to a fault. However, when they are alone with their own kind, they are friendly and respectful to each other. Few people from outside a svirfneblin community have ever seen this more pleasant side of the deep gnomes. For their part, the deep gnomes would be horrified to find themselves observed by outsiders, and they find such a person staring at them-or even looking directly at them-quite rude. Deep gnomes are gnarled and callused folk, with little fat at all on their wiry bodies. Their skin is the color of the rocks among which they live, almost as if they sprang directly from the stones themselves. They have dark gray eyes, tending toward black. Their hair is of a similar color, although it's only seen on the woman, as the men are entirely bald and beardless.

Forest Gnome Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:GnomeSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Forest Gnome		PREREGION:Great Dale																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.52	DESC:If deep gnomes are thought by some the black sheep of the gnome family (a title more fittingly reserved for the spriggans), then forest gnomes are the shy cousins. They are so reclusive that many times bigger people have "discovered" them, only to find that the forest gnomes have been living nearby for centuries. Forest gnomes are so quiet and painfully shy that they go to great lengths to avoid contact with others unless there is a great need to break their silence. Whereas the rock gnomes are friendly and loquacious and the deep gnomes are sullen and reserved, the forest gnomes are practically invisible, the wallflowers of the gnomes. They have a great love for nature, particularly deep and quiet forests far from civilization or even anyone else's homes. For this reason, many people-including other kinds of gnomes-have never seen a forest gnome. Most forest gnomes are extremely private, preferring to simply be left alone by other peoples. When among their own kind, they are a bit less reserved. They see themselves as caretakers of the forests in which they live, and about the only way to be sure to trigger a forest gnome attack is to directly harm their beloved forest. Forest gnomes are the smallest of the gnomes, averaging only 2 to 2 1/2 feet tall. Even the tallest forest gnome is less than 3 feet. They usually weigh around 25 to 30 pounds. Unlike other gnomes, they wear their hair and beards long, often almost to their feet when unbound. The males often trim their beards to a fine point or curl them into hornlike spikes extending to either side of their faces. Their skin is the color of bark, and their eyes are usually brown or blue. Their hair is brown or black, becoming gray or white with age.
Rock	KEY:Gnome ~ Rock (FR)		CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:GnomeSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	COST:0	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Rock Gnome			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Great Dale],[PREREGION:Lantan],[PREREGION:Thesk],[PREREGION:Western Heartlands]																																																							SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.55	DESC:Rock gnomes are the gnomes that most people are familiar with, so much so that when someone says "a gnome," he or she is almost always speaking of a rock gnome. Unlike their reclusive cousins, the deep gnomes and the forest gnomes, the rock gnomes are an inquisitive and loquacious people. They are renowned throughout Faerun as technicians, alchemists, and inventors, as well as illusionists of the highest order. They do not care much for living in larger cities, where their talents are in high demand, and prefer the rolling hills of the countryside. But anywhere they find themselves, they display an amazing zest for life and all the pleasures it holds. Rock gnomes are far friendlier and more outgoing than the other gnome kindreds. They are well known for their love of jokes and pranks, as well as their fondness for finely made things. As with all gnomes, they adore gems of all kinds, but rock gnomes have a particular passion for the purity and perfection of the diamond. Rock gnomes average between 3 and 3 1/2 feet tall, and weigh between 40 and 45 pounds. Their skin comes in many different shades of brown, but is unaffected by exposure to the sun. The hair of young gnomes can vary greatly in color, but in adulthood they all tend toward gray or white. The males wear their beards neatly trimmed. From a rock gnome's point of view, life is meant to be enjoyed in all its facets: work, play, and otherwise. Again, it's the process that's important, not the goal, even if those goals-like, say, finely cut gems-do end up being valuable on their own. This shows in just about everything a rock gnome does, from making a meal to working a mine to playing a practical joke. The care they put into their actions always shines through. Young rock gnomes have carefree childhoods. During their adolescence, rock gnomes are expected to learn the basics of a useful trade and to master the basics of self-defense. They are encouraged to dabble in all sorts of pastimes until they find something that perfectly fits their temperaments. They come of age at 40, an occasion for the largest party of their lives. From there, the average life expectancy is about 350 years, although some have been known to reach 500 years in age.

Common Half-Elf Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:HalfElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Common Half Elf		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Aglarond],[PREREGION:Dalelands],[PREREGION:High Forest],[PREREGION:Silverymoon],[PREREGION:Waterdeep]																																																			SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.59	DESC:Common half-elves are descended from humans and moon elves, sun elves, wild elves, or wood elves. While these people can be found all over Faerun, this section describes the half-elf culture of Aglarond, the land where the largest number of common half-elves live. Common half-elves blend human and elven features, influenced by the subrace of their elven parent and the ethnicity of their human parent. Moon half-elves have pale skin tinged bluish around the ears and chin, framing their lower faces. Sun half-elves have bronzed skin, and hair of gold. Wild half-elves have brown skin. Wood half-elves have coppery skin tinged with green highlights. Most common half-elves are a bit distant, used to being cast in the role of outsiders. In the Yuirwood, this isn't so: The half-elves make up the majority and have a long and proud history. Many half-elves come to the Yuirwood once they are old enough to leave home. Here, at last, is a place in which they can hope to be accepted. Half-elves are more slender than humans, and more heavily built than elves. Since the elves of Faerun are taller and more sturdily built than the elves of other worlds, Faerunian half-elves are very close to human size and weight. 
Half-Aquatic Elf Subrace	CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:HalfElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Half Aquatic Elf		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Dragon Coast]																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.60	DESC:Half-aquatic elves have no real society of their own. Born of human and sea elf blood, they are extremely rare, since sea elves rarely venture into human lands. Normally they live alone or in small groups along the shore, or they simply take up life in a human coastal community. Half-aquatic elves have pale green skin. Their hair can be any human color, but it usually has a faint green or blue cast to it. As they age, their hair becomes blue-silver. They have slight webbing between their fingers and toes, making them excellent swimmers. Although they cannot breathe water like their aquatic elf ancestors, half-aquatic elves feel drawn to the sea. If they seem distant or aloof, it's not because they're ignoring someone on purpose. They're always listening to the roar of the nearby surf, or imagining its sound if they travel far from the sea. Half-aquatic elves reach the age of majority at 20 years old and can live over to be over 180 years in age. Since aquatic elves are larger and heavier than most elves, half-aquatic elves have the same height and weight characteristics as a full-blooded human.
Half-Drow Elf Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:HalfElfSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Half Drow Elf		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Dalelands],[PREREGION:Dambrath]																																																															SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.62	DESC:In most lands, half-drow are rare. Since so many drow are irredeemably evil, they only mate with humans by way of rape or slavery. The only exception are the half-drow of the land of Dambrath in the Shining South, who arise from the centuries-old drow subjugation of the human folk of that land. Half-drow have dusky skin, silver or white hair, and a broad range of eye colors. They are often just as dark-hearted as their elven parents, but with a bitter resentment that comes from knowing that they are considered second-class members of drow society. In human society, half-drow are distrusted nearly as much as their full-blooded cousins. Despite this, good half-drow are much less rare than good drow. Whether this has to do with the influence of their human blood, or the desire to rebel against the drow who treat them so poorly, is difficult to tell.

They have no true homeland to call their own and as a result most spend their lives wandering the world in search of a purpose. Half-orcs are invariably the product of a human and an orc, but stories are told of half-orcs carrying the blood of dwarves, goblins, hobgoblins, and even halflings, gnomes, and elves. Orcs are a fecund race, and such stories likely have some genesis in truth. A half-orc is usually about as tall as a human and a little heavier. Their skin tends to be gray with green or even purple undertones, and their faces feature sloping brows, jutting jaws with prominent teeth, and flat, squashed noses. This and their coarse body hair make their lineage plain for all to see.

A gray orc looks less bestial than their more savage northern kin, but is still obviously nonhuman. They are somewhat hairy, with long manes of bristly hair on their heads, shoulders, and backs. Their faces are less porcine than the mountain orcs, with the exception of their tusks. They have yellow, orange, or red eyes, lupine ears, and black or gray hair. Gray orcs are more apt to wear "civilized" clothing than mountain orcs, and prefer varying shades of brown, black, blue, and other dark colors. Skin tones are usually gray with mottled patches of lighter or darker gray on the chest and flanks. Gray orc characters have the starting age, life expectancy, and height and weight characteristics of half-orcs.

In fact, many people assume that all orcs are like the savage warmongers found in these regions, and do not identify gray orcs or even half-orcs as separate races. A mountain orc is quite obviously a monstrous creature to most of the civilized folk of Faerun. Mountain orcs look vaguely like primitive humans but are a fair bit taller at seven or more feet in height; a rare few exceed eight feet in height. They have stocky, powerful necks, and their bestial heads seem to sit directly on their massive shoulders. Their eyes are always a deep shade of red, and their faces are dominated by porcine snouts and large tusks. Mountain orcs often weave braids and tiny bones into their thick matted hair, which is usually black. Their clothing is crude and primitive, often composed of unpleasant colors like blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. They are far from the cleanest race on Faerun and delight in decorating their bodies with scars and warpaint.
Orog Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:OrcSubrace.AltSubraceChoice				TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Orog			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Moonsea],[PREREGION:North],[PREREGION:Underdark (Northdark)]																																																									SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.71	DESC:Although everyone in Faerun knows about the orc hordes of the North (the mountain orcs) and the nomadic orcs of the East (the gray orcs), only a relative few know of a third subrace that hails from the deeps below ground. The Underdark is the chosen haunt of these terrible creatures, the orogs. After thousands of years of survival in the harsh and dangerous Underdark, the orogs have changed to match their home, becoming more ferocious and better able to cope with the dangers found there. Physically, an orog looks similar to a large mountain orc, except that the ears are somewhat larger, and their eyes are huge and pale. They average six and a half feet tall. Over the centuries, orogs have mastered the art of forging armor and weapons from the strange ores found in the Underdark. They favor halfplate and full plate armor, which are typically adorned with armor spikes. Orog weapons are festooned with a multitude of hooks, spines, and redundant cutting edges. An orog rarely goes anywhere without being fully armed and armored.
Tanarukk Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:OrcSubrace.PlanetouchedSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Tanarukk		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:North],[PREREGION:Underdark (Northdark)]																																																												SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.123	DESC:Bred from orc slaves and demons, tanarukks are a powerful and evil strain of planetouched who are spreading across the North. Because of their orc blood they breed rapidly, and there are more tanarukks than any other kind of planetouched. Entire tribes of the creatures have taken root in the Nether Mountains and continue to breed true, so in another twenty years they will be a serious threat to the tenuous peace in the North. With evil parentage on both sides of the family, tanarukks are almost always evil, without a drop of human blood in them to influence their disposition. &nl; Tanarukks are the descendants of orcs and tanar'ri (vrocks, in particular). Similar to tieflings, tanarukks are a mortal Faerunian creature with the bloodline of an evil outsider. They breed true with their own kind or with pureblooded orcs, and even orcs with one tanarukk grandparent have all the abilities of a tanarukk. Theoretically tanarukks could breed with goblinoids or even ogres and produce strange crossbreeds, although these are likely to be sterile. &nl; Unlike most planetouched, tanarukks have a fairly uniform appearance, resembling short, stocky orcs with stooped postures. Their hair is coarse, whether on their heads or the odd patches that grow on other parts of their bodies. They have sharp teeth and prominent lower tusks, with their lower jaw protruding farther than their small snouts. Their eyes are red and glow when angry. Their foreheads are low and ridged with horn or scales; their skin varies from gray-green to dun brown. &amp;nl Tanarukks have the same life expectancy and age categories as an orc. They use the dwarf height and weight tables.

#Lesser Air Genasi Subrace	CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:PlanetouchedSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Lesser Air Genasi	PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Calimshan],[PREREGION:Thay]																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.191		DESC:Air genasi are fast and free-willed. Because the traits that identify an air genasi are subtle, many go unrecognized for what they are for many years and are sometimes mistaken for sorcerers. Those who are overtly different quickly learn to disguise their nature from common folk, at least until they are able to protect themselves and strike out on their own.&nl; Air genasi are descended from outsiders native to the Elemental Plane of Air and humans. Most air genasi in Faerun come from bloodlines established over nine thousand years ago by the djinn who founded what is now Calimshan. A few rare air genasi derive from djinn summoned in other parts of the world, and some are said to be born of a line founded by a powerful air mephit sorcerer who lived on the Great Glacier hundreds of years ago. The numbers descended from the servants of air deities such as Akadi, Auril, and Shaundakul are unknown, but likely to be very small. Legends tell of elves similar to air genasi, possibly descended from followers of the elven goddess Aerdrie Faenya, but it is likely that these legends are just confused reports of the avariels.&nl; Air genasi look human except for one or two distinguishing features related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these features are: light blue skin, pale white skin, white hair, light blue hair, a constant breeze in their presence, flesh that is cool to the touch, voice that can be heard over any nonmagical wind, any sudden movement is accompanied by whistling wind &nl; Air genasi revel in their unusual nature, although few ever try to locate the being who founded their bloodline, since most are long dead or banished back the Elemental Plane of Air. Because the Calimshan djinn bloodlines are so old and have suffered many crossbreedings, it is almost impossible to tell by normal means if two air genasi are from the same bloodline. As a result, all air genasi treat each other as "cousins," although in an arrogant and competitive way.&nl; Air genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as a human.
#Lesser Earth Genasi Subrace	CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:PlanetouchedSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Lesser Earth Genasi	PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Mulhorand],[PREREGION:Thay]																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.191		DESC:Earth genasi are patient, stubborn, and contemplative in their decision-making. Marked at birth with obvious traits reflecting their heritage, earth genasi are often shunned by others, but their physical gifts make them able to defend themselves against most attackers. Their strength and girth means that they sometimes become bullies, attracting sycophants out of fear and respect for their power. &nl; At least three-quarters of the earth genasi in Faern are the descendants of outsiders native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and humans. The rest are descended from earth deities or servants thereof instead of elemental outsiders. Most of the elemental bloodlines originate in the North, particularly near the Spine of the World, as natural portals to the Elemental Plane of Earth form there, allowing meetings between natives of both planes. The bloodlines spring up wherever worship of earth deities is common. It is thought that the Ludwakazar clan of shield dwarves deep in the Earthspurs in Impiltur and the Tobarin family of rock gnomes in the Great Dale have elemental blood, but both are mute on the question and neither would be a true earth genasi, but something quite different. &nl; Earth genasi are obviously not human, but have mostly human features except for one or two distinguishing traits related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these features are: earthlike skin, eyes like black pits, eyes like gems, gravelly voice, very large hands and feet, iron gray hair, sweats mud instead of water, metallic sheen to skin or hair &nl; Earth genasi, like all elemental planetouched, are proud of their nature and abilities, but their pride is a quiet, confident sort rather than a boastful one. Earth genasi are pragmatic about their parentage, usually not going out of their way to learn their ancestry but not avoiding the topic either. Earth genasi have no special relationship with others of their kind, although they seem to prefer others who share their physical differences. &nl; Earth genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as a human.
Fey'ri Subrace			CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:PlanetouchedSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Fey'ri			PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Delimbiyr Vale]																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.118	DESC:The result of four noble houses of sun elves breeding with demons in an attempt to strengthen their bloodline, fey'ri are a type of planetouched that breeds true among their own kind. Marked by their fiendish blood, fey'ri are unique among most planetouched in that they have a self-sustaining community, so they are raised among their own kind. Because of this, young fey'ri do not suffer the feelings of ostracism that other planetouched do despite growing up among creatures with strong fiendish blood. Most fey'ri are evil, but a few are able to shrug off the fiendish taint's influence on their behavior and emulate some small part of the innate good nature of the elves. &nl; Fey'ri are the descendants of sun elves and demons (usually succubi in male or female form). Having bred with these demons and among their own kind, fey'ri are a distinct race and share the same common fiendish traits. In general form they resemble sun elves, although all have large batlike wings. They all have one or more unusual features reflecting their fiendish heritage, such as: fiery red eyes, fine scales all over the skin, long pointed tails, batlike ears, deep red skin &nl; Fey'ri are obviously different from normal elves and would quickly be killed by most other elves if discovered. Luckily for them, their demonic bloodline gives them several abilities, including the ability to change their shape. Thus they can pass freely among other creatures without causing an alarm. &nl; There may be other fey'ri in Faerun other than those allied with House Dlardrageth, but since the likelihood of an elf breeding with a demon is very small, such an individual would be essentially unique outside these four elven houses. The rest of this section assumes Dlardrageth fey'ri are the subject matter. &nl; Fey'ri have the same life expectancy and age categories as a sun elf.

Mercurial, proud, and often fearless, they are not content to sit and watch the world pass them by. Fire genasi have obvious physical traits that mark them as different from humans, and they are often the target of mistrust and persecution. Some fire genasi are able to use their quick wits to turn the tables on their tormentors, while others find that their barbed words only make their foes more angry. Many fire genasi are destroyed as infants by their own parents, who fear that they are demonspawn. &nl; Most fire genasi in Faerun are descended from the efreet that once ruled Calimshan. Planetouched of this derivation live all over the Lands of Intrigue, and some have traveled away from their ancestral homeland to escape the fear and prejudice that Calishites bear for genies. Chult, the Lake of Steam, and Unther also have a small number of fire genasi, for those lands bear volcanoes that sometimes act as natural portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing efreet and other fiery outsiders to make contact with humans. A large family of fire genasilike halflings was known to live in Unther, but the war with Mulhorand has displaced them and their current whereabouts are unknown. &nl; Fire genasi are obviously not fully human, having mostly human features except for one or two exceptional traits related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these features are: charcoal gray skin, deep red skin, red or orange hair that waves like flames, eyes that glow when the genasi is angry, unusually warm skin, large red teeth, always smell like smoke &nl; Fire genasi are proud of their ancestry and consider themselves superior to normal humans, although the smarter ones don't make an issue of it. Because the efreet-descended genasi of Calimshan have almost no chance of finding their original elemental ancestor (who have long since been slain, banished, or imprisoned when their empire was overthrown), they make no effort to do so and enjoy the gifts that ancestor's blood has granted them. Fire genasi enjoy the company of their own kind and have been known to form elite groups of mages or fighters that hire themselves out on the basis of their skill and heritage. They have been known to adopt the fire genasi children of human parents as well. Fire genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as a human.

At times they are fierce and destructive like terrible storms, but more often than not they present a tranquil appearance, despite whatever emotions run underneath that quiet surface. Because their elemental forebear usually has no interest in them, water genasi are often abandoned by their human parents and raised instead by aquatic creatures such as aquatic elves, dolphins, locathah, merfolk, sahuagin, or even aboleths. Water genasi usually leave their parents (real or adoptive) upon reaching maturity, taking to the open sea in order to explore, learn, and develop their own personality and place in the world. &nl; Most water genasi are descended from a water elemental outsider such as a marid (water genie) or triton. A rare few are born of outsider servants of the evil water goddess Umberlee (although it is not known why these matings eventually produce water genasi instead of tieflings). Aquatic elves tell of a lost line of sea-elf planetouched descended from minions of Deep Sashelas, but these are not true water genasi, lacking a genasi's human heritage. &nl; Water genasi look human except for one distinguishing feature related to their ancestor. Some examples of these features are: lightly scaled skin, clammy flesh, blue-green skin or hair, large blue-black eyes, webbed hands and feat &nl; Water genasi feel that they are unique and superior to the humans who bore them. They have little or no interest in others of their kind-since they can wander both the land and the seas, they feel there is room enough in the world that water genasi need not crowd each other or even meet. Only in large communities of aquatic elves are two or more water genasi likely to spend much time together. &nl; Water genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as humans.

Those who are overtly different quickly learn to disguise their nature from common folk, at least until they are able to protect themselves and strike out on their own.&nl; Air genasi are descended from outsiders native to the Elemental Plane of Air and humans. Most air genasi in Faerun come from bloodlines established over nine thousand years ago by the djinn who founded what is now Calimshan. A few rare air genasi derive from djinn summoned in other parts of the world, and some are said to be born of a line founded by a powerful air mephit sorcerer who lived on the Great Glacier hundreds of years ago. The numbers descended from the servants of air deities such as Akadi, Auril, and Shaundakul are unknown, but likely to be very small. Legends tell of elves similar to air genasi, possibly descended from followers of the elven goddess Aerdrie Faenya, but it is likely that these legends are just confused reports of the avariels.&nl; Air genasi look human except for one or two distinguishing features related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these features are: light blue skin, pale white skin, white hair, light blue hair, a constant breeze in their presence, flesh that is cool to the touch, voice that can be heard over any nonmagical wind, any sudden movement is accompanied by whistling wind &nl; Air genasi revel in their unusual nature, although few ever try to locate the being who founded their bloodline, since most are long dead or banished back the Elemental Plane of Air. Because the Calimshan djinn bloodlines are so old and have suffered many crossbreedings, it is almost impossible to tell by normal means if two air genasi are from the same bloodline. As a result, all air genasi treat each other as "cousins," although in an arrogant and competitive way.&nl; Air genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as a human.

Because the traits that identify an air genasi are subtle, many go unrecognized for what they are for many years and are sometimes mistaken for sorcerers. Those who are overtly different quickly learn to disguise their nature from common folk, at least until they are able to protect themselves and strike out on their own.&nl; Air genasi are descended from outsiders native to the Elemental Plane of Air and humans. Most air genasi in Faerun come from bloodlines established over nine thousand years ago by the djinn who founded what is now Calimshan. A few rare air genasi derive from djinn summoned in other parts of the world, and some are said to be born of a line founded by a powerful air mephit sorcerer who lived on the Great Glacier hundreds of years ago. The numbers descended from the servants of air deities such as Akadi, Auril, and Shaundakul are unknown, but likely to be very small. Legends tell of elves similar to air genasi, possibly descended from followers of the elven goddess Aerdrie Faenya, but it is likely that these legends are just confused reports of the avariels.&nl; Air genasi look human except for one or two distinguishing features related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these features are: light blue skin, pale white skin, white hair, light blue hair, a constant breeze in their presence, flesh that is cool to the touch, voice that can be heard over any nonmagical wind, any sudden movement is accompanied by whistling wind &nl; Air genasi revel in their unusual nature, although few ever try to locate the being who founded their bloodline, since most are long dead or banished back the Elemental Plane of Air. Because the Calimshan djinn bloodlines are so old and have suffered many crossbreedings, it is almost impossible to tell by normal means if two air genasi are from the same bloodline. As a result, all air genasi treat each other as "cousins," although in an arrogant and competitive way.&nl; Air genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as a human.
#Earth Genasi Subrace		CATEGORY:Internal	COST:0	TYPE:PlanetouchedSubrace.AltSubraceChoice	TEMPLATE:Subrace ~ Earth Genasi		PREMULT:1,[PREREGION:Mulhorand],[PREREGION:Thay]																																																															SOURCEPAGE:RAC p.116	DESC:Earth genasi are patient, stubborn, and contemplative in their decision-making. Marked at birth with obvious traits reflecting their heritage, earth genasi are often shunned by others, but their physical gifts make them able to defend themselves against most attackers. Their strength and girth means that they sometimes become bullies, attracting sycophants out of fear and respect for their power. &nl; At least three-quarters of the earth genasi in Faern are the descendants of outsiders native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and humans. The rest are descended from earth deities or servants thereof instead of elemental outsiders. Most of the elemental bloodlines originate in the North, particularly near the Spine of the World, as natural portals to the Elemental Plane of Earth form there, allowing meetings between natives of both planes. The bloodlines spring up wherever worship of earth deities is common. It is thought that the Ludwakazar clan of shield dwarves deep in the Earthspurs in Impiltur and the Tobarin family of rock gnomes in the Great Dale have elemental blood, but both are mute on the question and neither would be a true earth genasi, but something quite different. &nl; Earth genasi are obviously not human, but have mostly human features except for one or two distinguishing traits related to their elemental ancestor. Some examples of these features are: earthlike skin, eyes like black pits, eyes like gems, gravelly voice, very large hands and feet, iron gray hair, sweats mud instead of water, metallic sheen to skin or hair &nl; Earth genasi, like all elemental planetouched, are proud of their nature and abilities, but their pride is a quiet, confident sort rather than a boastful one. Earth genasi are pragmatic about their parentage, usually not going out of their way to learn their ancestry but not avoiding the topic either. Earth genasi have no special relationship with others of their kind, although they seem to prefer others who share their physical differences. &nl; Earth genasi have the same life expectancy and age categories as a human.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level of arcane devotee to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level arcane spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that granted access to 4th-level spells before he became an arcane devotee, he must decide to which class he adds each level of arcane devotee for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Any time he is the target of a harmless spell cast by a divine spellcaster of his patron deity, the spell functions as if affected by the Empower Spell feat, if applicable. The spell must be cast by another character- even if the arcane devotee has levels in a divine spellcasting class, he does not gain this benefit for divine spells he casts on himself.

For example, a 4th-level divine champion armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+4 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high strength or magical effects that would normally apply. If a divine champion accidentally smites a creature that is not of an opposing alignment or deity, the smite has no effect but is still used up for that day.

These modifiers are sacred bonuses if the divine champion's patron is of good alignment, or profane bonuses if her deity is of evil alignment. If the patron deity is neutral, the divine champion's alignment determines whether the bonuses are sacred or profane. If both the divine champion and her patron are neutral, the character chooses whether the bonuses are sacred or profane when she first gains the ability.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the level of divine disciple to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class granted her access to 4thlevel divine spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

Since it is a spell-like ability, the divine disciple does not need to devote a 4th-level spell slot to its use, though the imbued spells themselves take up her lower-level spell slots, as usual.

This apotheosis grants her immunity to any spell or effect that does not affect outsiders (for example, charm person cannot affect her) as well as darkvision out to 60 feet, if she does not already have it. Because of her native subtype, however, the divine disciple must still eat, breathe, and sleep, and she can be reincarnated, raised, or resurrected normally. She also gains any alignment subtypes that match alignment components she has in common with her deity. Thus, a chaotic neutral divine disciple of a chaotic evil deity gains the chaotic subtype, and a divine disciple of a neutral deity gains no additional subtypes.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the level of incantatrix to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class granted her access to 3rd-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Cooperative Metamagic		KEY:Incantatrix ~ Cooperative Metamagic					SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantatrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantatrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 2nd level, an incantatrix gains the ability to apply any metamagic feat she possesses (except Silent Spell, Still Spell, or Quicken Spell) to a spell being cast by a willing allied spellcaster. The caster need not prepare the spell in metamagic form or in a higher-level spell slot; the incantatrix simply modifies the spell during the casting. Using this ability is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, just like casting a spell, though the incantatrix can use the Concentration skill with this ability as though she were casting defensively. The incantatrix must ready an action to use cooperative metamagic when her ally begins casting and must be adjacent to the caster. The incantatrix must make a Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3 x modified spell level]) to succeed. "Modified spell level" is the level of the spell slot that the spell would occupy if it were prepared with the metamagic feat applied. Any spell level increases from metamagic feats that the caster applied also count toward the modified spell level. For example, if an incantatrix applies the Maximize Spell feat to an ally's chain lightning spell, the modified spell level is 9th (6th for the spell, +1 for the Maximize Spell feat), and the DC is 18 + (3 x 9) = 45. If she applies the same feat to an ally's silent chain lightning spell, the modified spell level is 10th and the Spellcraft DC is 48. An incantatrix can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Int modifier.																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Metamagic Effect			KEY:Incantatrix ~ Metamagic Effect						SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantatrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantatrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 3rd level, an incantatrix can attempt to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to a persistent spell effect that is already in place. For example, she could use Extend Spell to extend the duration of a wall of force or Maximize Spell to maximize the damage dealt by a cloudkill. To use this ability, the incantatrix must be adjacent to or within the spell effect and make a successful Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3 x modified spell level]). "Modified spell level" is the level of the spell slot that the spell would occupy if it were prepared with the metamagic feat applied. Spell slot increases for metamagic feats that were applied to affect the spell's casting (such as Still Spell, Silent Spell, or Quicken Spell) do not count toward the modified spell level, but adjustments for metamagic that change the spell's effect (such as Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, or Widen Spell) do count. For example, applying the Extend Spell feat to a wall of fire gives it a modified spell level of 5th (4th for the spell +1 for the Extend Spell feat), so the DC would be 18 + (3 x 5) = 33. If the wall of fire had been cast with the Silent Spell feat applied, the DC is still 33, since that feat applies to the spell's casting, not its effect. On the other hand, extending an empowered wall of fire would give it a modified spell level of 7th and a Spellcraft DC of 39. An incantatrix can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Int modifier. Using this ability is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Metamagic Spell Trigger		KEY:Incantatrix ~ Metamagic Spell Trigger					SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantatrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantatrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 5th level, an incantatrix gains the ability to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to the effect of a spell trigger item (generally a wand). To use this ability, she must have the appropriate item creation feat to make the spell trigger item she is using. Using metamagic spell trigger expends a number of additional charges from the item equal to the number of effective spell levels the metamagic feat would add to a spell. For example, an incantatrix can use Quicken Spell to modify a spell cast from a wand by spending 5 charges (1 + 4 additional charges for the spell slot increase). Alternatively, she can apply Empower Spell to the effect by spending 3 charges, or trigger it silently by spending 2 charges. The Still Spell feat confers no benefit when applied to a spell trigger item. An incantatrix cannot use this ability when using a spell trigger item that does not h ave charges, such as a strand of prayer beads.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Seize Concentration		KEY:Incantatrix ~ Seize Concentration						SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantatrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantatrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 6th level, an incantatrix gains the ability to wrest control of a spell that requires concentration (such as implosion, major image, or summon swarm) from another spellcaster within 30 feet. If the target spellcaster is willing, this transfer of concentration occurs automatically. Otherwise, the incantatrix and the target spellcaster make an opposed caster level check. A divine spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check. If the incantatrix wins, she gains control of the spell for as long as she maintains concentration or until the original spell duration expires. The spell functions as though the incantatrix were the caster (even if it is a spell she cannot cast), except that any variables determined when the spell was cast (including its caster level) remain a s determined by the original c aster. The o riginal spellcaster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it. If the incantatrix allows her concentration to lapse before the spell duration expires, the original caster may reassert control over his spell by making a successful caster level check (DC 15 + spell level). If he fails to do so, no one controls the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Instant Metamagic			KEY:Incantatrix ~ Instant Metamagic						SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantatrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantatrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:Once per day, a 7th-level or higher incantatrix can apply a single metamagic feat she possesses to a spell without preparing it that way beforehand (if she prepares spells) or increasing its casting time (if she does not prepare spells). Thus, a wizard's prepared spell works as if she had prepared it with the metamagic feat, but it does not use a higher-level spell slot. A sorcerer or bard's spell is cast without adjusting its casting time, but it works as if he had cast it with the metamagic feat. A 9th-level incantatrix can use this power twice per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Snatch Spell			KEY:Incantatrix ~ Snatch Spell							SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantatrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantatrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 8th level, an incantatrix can attempt to seize control over a persistent effect created by another spellcaster. The effect must be one that does not depend on concentration but still relies on or responds to the caster's control (such as a summon monster spell or spiritual weapon, but not a wall of fire or acid fog). Furthermore, the effect (but not necessarily the spellcaster) must be within 30 feet of the incantatrix. The target spellcaster and the incantatrix make an opposed caster level check. A divine spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check. If the incantatrix wins, she gains control of the spell until its original duration expires. The spell functions as though the incantatrix had cast it, except that any variables determined when the spell was cast (including its caster level) remain as determined by the caster. The original caster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it. If the spell is dismissible and the incantatrix wishes to dismiss it, she must make a second successful opposed caster level check to do so. If she fails, the spell remains in effect and control reverts to the original caster.																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.63
Improved Metamagic		KEY:Incantatrix ~ Improved Metamagic						SORTKEY:Class ~ Incantatrix			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incantatrix Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 10th level, an incantatrix has mastered metamagic to such an extent that whenever she uses a metamagic feat, the required increase in spell level (if any) is reduced by one (minimum +1 spell level). For example, a wizard incantatrix could prepare a quickened fireball as a 6th-level spell instead of a 7th-level spell. This benefit also applies to the incantatrix's other class abilities. Thus, the DC for using her metamagic effect or cooperative metamagic ability is reduced appropriately for the metamagic feats involved, and she spends fewer charges when using metamagic spell trigger.

This essentially means that he adds the level of runecaster to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class granted him access to 3rd-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class that granted access to 3rd-level spells before he became a runecaster, he must decide to which class he adds each level of runecaster for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

These extra features increase the cost of the rune, as shown on the table. Works When Read or Passed: Any attempt to study, identify, or fathom a rune's meaning counts as "reading" the rune. Passing through any portal that bears a rune counts as "passing" it. To affect a target, a rune must have an unbroken line of effect to it and be within 30 feet of it. A rune that is triggered when passed can be set for almost any special condition the runecaster specifies. Runes can be set to trigger according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or race (such as drow or aberration). They can also trigger based on good, evil, law, or chaos, or a creature's patron deity. They cannot, however, be set to trigger by class, Hit Dice, or level. Runes respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by creatures that travel past them ethereally.

The double has the ability scores, base AC, hit points, saves, and attack bonuses of its creator, but no equipment. (Any apparent clothing or equipment is nonfunctional.) Since it can use anything its creator can, the double can attack the creator's enemies if given a weapon or item with which to do so. Alternatively, it can function as the target of a project image spell, duplicating the creator's actions and functioning as the origin of the creator's spells when it is within his direct line of sight. Mentally commanding the double is a free action. Using it as the originator of a spell counts as an action of the sort needed to cast the spell for both the creator and the double. Causing either the creator or the double to leave the plane they share dismisses the double. The double lasts 1 round per caster level.

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Spellguard of Silverymoon ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		SORTKEY:Class ~ Spellguard of Silverymoon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Spellguard of Silverymoon Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:When a new spellguard of Silverymoon level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level spells before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level of spellguard of Silverymoon to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that granted access to 4th-level spells before he became a spellguard of Silverymoon, he must decide to which class he adds each level of spellguard for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

As long as he has this token in his possession, he may cast conjuration (summoning) spells, evocation [fire] spells, and spells with the teleportation descriptor within the wards of Silverymoon. He may also freely use magic items that produce those effects. This token does not magically appear in the spellguard's possession; he must return to Silverymoon to receive it from his superior.

Selective Spell			KEY:Spellguard of Silverymoon ~ Selective Spell				SORTKEY:Class ~ Spellguard of Silverymoon	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellguard of Silverymoon Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:Spellguards are specifically trained to minimize collateral damage when casting their combat spells. Once per day per point of Intelligence bonus (minimum once per day), a spellguard o f at least 3 rd level may d esignate a s ingle type (and subtype, if desired) of creature when casting a spell. When a single creature type has multiple subtypes, the spellguard may choose to count only one of the subtypes or all of them, at his discretion. At the spellguard's option, that type of creature is either the only type affected by the spell or the only type unaffected by it. Inorganic material, objects, and anything else that does not have a creature type i s affected normally. Casting a selective spell requires a fullround action. For example, suppose a spellguard is patrolling the forest around Silverymoon with a p arty o f Knights in S ilver made up o f two humans, an elf, and a dwarf. Suddenly, the group is rushed by goblins. The spellguard uses his selective spell ability to cast a fireball, designating humanoid (goblinoid) as the only creature type affected. The fireball detonates in the midst of the melee, and although the spellguard's companions are within the area of the spell, they are spared any ill effects. At 5th level, the spellguard may designate multiple creature types and subtypes for a s elective spell. Each type o r subtype so designated, however, uses up one additional use per day of his selective spell ability.

Though that purpose has largely become secondary to defending the city, spellguards still receive some training in serving as bodyguards. At 4th level, the spellguard of Silverymoon may cast any personal-range defensive arcane spell on another character with a touch. For this purpose, a defensive spell is one that improves AC, increases a saving throw modifier, or grants additional hit points (either by healing wounds or by bestowing temporary hit points).

# Zhentarim Spy
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Zhentarim spies are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to Swim checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Cover Identity			KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Cover Identity						SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A Zhentarim spy is rigorously trained to establish nearly flawless cover identities. For every distinct Craft or Profession skill in which she has at least 2 ranks, she may have one cover identity. Each cover identity must be a specific person (such as "Jolan Turnbuckle, bread-baker for the town of Shadowdale"), not a generic description (such as "baker"). She may at any time end an existing cover identity and establish a new one in its place. While operating under any of her cover identities, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Gather Information checks. For each additional 2 ranks (beyond the minimum 2) that the Zhentarim spy possesses in a cover identity's associated Craft or Profession skill, each of these bonuses increases by 1. At the DM's discretion, these bonuses may be reduced or eliminated in regions where the cover identity would seem out of place (bakers from Shadowdale, for example, would attract suspicion in the ruins of Myth Drannor). Establishing a new cover identity or replacing an old one means the Zhentarim spy must acquire documentation and personal effects, establish a place of business, and otherwise set up a believable second life. This process takes 1d4 tendays, during which she may do nothing else, and costs 6d10 gp. The Zhentarim spy does not need to set up a cover identity immediately for every Craft or Profession skill in which she has 2 ranks; she may wait until a good opportunity presents itself if desired. For example, she might wish to hold a cover identity option in reserve to take advantage of the unlikely cover class ability (see below). The cover identity ability does not provide any additional skills that might be necessary to make a cover identity believable, such as knowledge of the proper homeland, the ability to speak a foreign language, spellcasting ability, or the like. Thus, Zhentarim spies generally pick cover identities that complement their existing skills.																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Sneak Attack			KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Sneak Attack						SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:This ability functions like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by 1d6 points at 2nd level, and by another 1d6 points at 4th level. If a Zhentarim spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack. Furthermore, Zhentarim spy levels stack with any other appropriate class levels (such as rogue or assassin) for the purpose of overcoming improved uncanny dodge.

Undetectable Alignment		KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Undetectable Alignment				SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 2nd level, the Zhentarim spy's rigorous m ental training e nables h er t o cloud ev en d ivination spells. This ability functions like the undetectable alignment spell, except that it i s always active and, as an extraordinary ability, is subject to neither dispelling nor suppression by dead magic zones and the like.

Unlikely Cover			KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Unlikely Cover						SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 3rd level, the Zhentarim spy may designate a number of cover identities equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum one) as "unlikely covers." In such a cover identity, she is disguised as someone drastically different from herself-a member of the opposite sex or a different race, or someone with a very different body shape. She may need to spend the time to establish new cover identities if she does not have any appropriate identities available. While she operates in an unlikely cover, her normal bonuses on Disguise, Bluff, and Gather Information checks for a cover identity are doubled (to +8 on Disguise checks, +4 on Bluff and Gather Information checks, and +2 per 2 extra ranks on checks made with the cover identity's Craft or Profession skill). Furthermore, the DC for Spot checks made to penetrate her disguise increases by 4.

Slippery Mind			KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Slippery Mind						SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 4th level, the Zhentarim spy gains the slippery mind special ability (see the rogue class description on page 50 of the Player's Handbook) if she did not already have it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Deep Cover				KEY:Zhentarim Spy ~ Deep Cover						SORTKEY:Class ~ Zhentarim Spy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Zhentarim Spy Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 5th level, the Zhentarim spy may choose a number of new cover identities equal to her Intelligence bonus (minimum one). These may be the same cover identities selected for the unlikely cover ability, or they may be different ones, or they may be a mixture o f both. Unlike h er unlikely cov er i dentities, however, the identities she selects for deep cover need not be new. When the Zhentarim spy is operating within one of her deep cover identities, her mind is so thoroughly trained and conditioned to think like the person she pretends to be that any magical scrying or mind reading at a power level short of deific reveals nothing about her true nature. Only the thoughts, alignment, and emotions of the fictitious persona can be detected.
