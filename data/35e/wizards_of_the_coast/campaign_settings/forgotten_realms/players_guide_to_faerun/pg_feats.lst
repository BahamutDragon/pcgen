Arcane Preparation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																													DESC:You can prepare an arcane spell ahead of time just as a wizard does. When you do so, you need not take any extra time to apply metamagic feats upon casting that spell.																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.32		DESC:Each day, you can use one or more of your spell slots to prepare spells you know. (Usually, you do this in order to apply a metamagic feat to the spell.) Thereafter, you can cast that spell as a standard action even if you apply a metamagic feat to the spell as you cast it. Preparing a spell uses a slot of the appropriate level. Once the spell is prepared, you can't use that spell slot for anything else until you cast the prepared spell. Normal: A sorcerer or bard who applies a metamagic feat to a spell must cast it as a full-round action instead of a standard action.
Daylight Adaptation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																													PRERACE:1,Dwarf,Half-Elf,Elf,Kuo-toa,Orc										DESC:You have accustomed yourself to the painful sunlight of the surface world.																																																																																			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Daylight Blindness Override										SOURCEPAGE:p.37		DESC:Unlike other members of your race, you are not dazzled or blinded by exposure to bright light or sunlight. However, spells or effects that affect all creatures regardless of race, such as a sunbeam or sunburst spell, still affect you normally. Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You may have only one regional feat.
Delay Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																										DESC:You can cast spells that take effect after a short delay of your choosing.																																																ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.37		DESC:When casting a spell, you set a delay of 1 to 5 rounds before it takes effect. The delay time cannot be changed once set; the spell activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only area, personal, and touch spells can be affected by this feat. Any decisions you would make about the spell (including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area) are decided when the spell is cast, with any of its effects (including damage and saving throws) decided when the spell triggers. If conditions change during the delay period in ways that would make the spell impossible to cast (the target you designate moves beyond the spells range, for example), the spell fails. During the delay period, a delayed spell can be dispelled normally, and it can be detected in the area or on the target (as applicable).
Innate Spell (PG)		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic.Wizard														PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Silent Spell,Still Spell																									DESC:You have mastered a spell so thoroughly that you can now use it as a spell-like ability.																																																																																	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Innate Spell ~ Choice|1														SOURCEPAGE:p.39		DESC:Choose a spell that you know. You can now use this spell three times per day as a spell-like ability. If the innate spell has an XP cost, you pay that cost each time you use the spell. If it has a focus, you must have it to use the spell in this manner. If the innate spell has a costly material component, you need an item worth 50 times that amount to use as a focus for the spell-like ability. Otherwise, you need no components to use the innate spell as a spell-like ability. You must permanently assign one spell slot of the appropriate spell level to the innate spell. You can't use this spell slot for anything else-that is, you can cast one fewer spell per day at that spell level than you could if you didn't have an innate spell. For example, if you could normally cast three 3rd-level spells per day and you choose fireball as your innate spell, you can now cast only two 3rdlevel spells per day, but you gain three uses per day of fireball as a spell-like ability. Special: You can choose this feat more than once, selecting a different innate spell each time.
Inscribe Rune		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation.Wizard	PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=5																	PRESTAT:1,INT=13																		DESC:You can create magic runes that hold spells until triggered.																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.40		DESC:You can cast any divine spell you have access to as a rune. You must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell would reduce your XP total, you pay that cost upon beginning the rune in addition to the XP cost for making the rune itself. Likewise, material components are consumed when you begin writing the rune, but focuses are not. See Rune Magic in Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting for details on runes and rune magic. A single object of Medium size or smaller can hold only one rune. A larger object can hold one rune per 25 square feet of surface area. Runes cannot be placed on creatures, although they can be drawn on equipment a creature carries. The rune has a price equal to its spell level ? caster level ? 50 gp. (A 0- level spell counts as 1 /2 level.) You must spend 1/25 of the price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the price to inscribe the rune. Note: The rune cost multiple given here (50 gp) supersedes the one given in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting (100 gp).
Insidious Magic		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic.Wizard														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																										DESC:You can use the Shadow Weave to make your spells harder for Weave users to detect.																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.40		DESC:Any Weave user who employs a divination spell (such as detect magic), spell-like ability, or magic item that could detect the magical aura of one of your spells must make a successful level check (DC 11 + your caster level) to succeed. Similarly, a Weave user attempting to reveal the effects of one of your spells via a divination spell (such as see invisibility) must make a caster level check to succeed. The Weave user may check only once for each divination spell used, no matter how many of your spell effects are operating in that area. All creatures employing spells or spell-like abilities are considered Weave users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. This benefit does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation.
Magical Artisan		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=ItemCreation																										DESC:You have mastered the method of creating a certain kind of magic item.																						STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|FEAT|PC[TYPE=ItemCreation]			SELECT:1																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.41		DESC:Choose one item creation feat that you possess. When you make an item with that feat, you pay only 75%% of the normal cost to create the item. Special: You may gain Magical Artisan multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new item creation feat.
Pernicious Magic		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic.Wizard														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																										DESC:You can use the Shadow Weave to make your spells harder for Weave users to resist.																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:You gain a +4 bonus on caster level checks made to defeat a Weave user's spell resistance. All creatures employing spells or spell-like abilities are considered Weave users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. This benefit stacks with those from the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration feats, but it does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation.
Persistent Spell		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic.Wizard														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extend Spell																											DESC:You can make a spell last all day.																																																							ADDSPELLLEVEL:6																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:A persistent spell has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent spell must have a personal range or fixed range (for example, comprehend languages or detect magic). Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effects are discharged. You need not concentrate on spells such as detect magic or detect thoughts to be aware of the mere presence or absence of the thing detected, but you must still concentrate to gain additional information as normal. Concentration on such a spell is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot six levels higher than the spell's actual level.
Portal Master		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation.Wizard													PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wondrous Item																										DESC:You are especially proficient at creating portals-permanent magic devices that instantaneously transport those who know their secrets from one locale to another. Faerun is riddled with portals.																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:When you build a portal, you pay only 50%% of the normal cost to create the device. This benefit does not stack with that provided by the Magical Artisan feat. In addition, you know how to pass through dangerous portals safely. As a standard action, you can attempt to stabilize a malfunctioning portal temporarily. Make a Spellcraft check and add the check result to the d%% roll for the effect of the malfunctioning portal (see Table 2-2 in Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting). The portal remains stable for 1 minute, and you can retry the stabilization as often as you like.
Reactive Counterspell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General															PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Counterspell,Improved Initiative																						DESC:You can react quickly to counter spells cast by opponents.																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.42		DESC:Once per round, you can counterspell an opponent's spell even if you have not readied an action to do so. This counterspell action takes the place of your next turn. You can't use this feat when you are flat-footed. Normal: Without this feat, you must ready an action each round that you wish to use a counterspell.
Shadow Weave Magic	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																													PREMULT:1,[PRESTAT:1,WIS=15],[PREDEITY:1,Shar]									DESC:You have discovered the dangerous secret of the Shadow Weave.																																																						BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|SCHOOL.Evocation|-1	BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|SCHOOL.Transmutation|-1		BONUS:DC|SCHOOL.Enchantment|1	BONUS:DC|SCHOOL.Illusion|1	BONUS:DC|SCHOOL.Necromancy|1																						SOURCEPAGE:p.43		DESC:From now on, your spells tap the Shadow Weave instead of the Weave. You can also activate magic items that use the Shadow Weave without taking damage. The saving throw for every spell you cast from the schools of enchantment, illusion, and necromancy increases by +1. You also get a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with spells from these schools. The Shadow Weave proves less than optimal for effects involving energy or matter. Your effective caster level for spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation (except spells with the darkness descriptor) is reduced by one. A 1st-level Shadow Weave user cannot cast spells from these schools at all. You can no longer cast spells with the light descriptor. No matter what school they are from, such spells automatically fail. Your ability to use magic items that produce light effects is also limited-you cannot invoke an item's light power if its activation method is spell completion or spell trigger. From now on, any magic item you create is a Shadow Weave item (see Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting).
Signature Spell		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Mastery																											DESC:You are so familiar with a mastered spell that you can convert other prepared spells into that spell.																	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLS|ABILITY=FEAT[Spell Mastery]																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.43		DESC:Choose one spell that you have mastered with the Spell Mastery feat as your signature spell. You may now convert prepared arcane spells of that spell's level or higher into your signature spell, just as a good cleric can spontaneously cast prepared spells as cure spells. Special: You can gain Signature Spell multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different mastered spell.
Spell Thematics		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=1																															DEFINE:SpellThematicCount|0		DESC:Your spells manifest with a distinct theme or appearance.																																																																																						BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spell Thematics|SpellThematicCount												SOURCEPAGE:p.44		DESC:Due to the unusual appearance of your spells, the DC of any Spellcraft check made to identify a spell you have cast increases by +4. In addition, you may designate one spell you know per spell level as a thematic spell and cast it at +1 caster level. As you gain access to new spell levels, you can designate new thematic spells; you don't need to select this feat again to acquire new thematic spells. Nearly any theme is possible, so long as you can describe a visual link for unification. For example, your theme might be "lightning," "spheres," or "screaming skulls." If you choose spheres as your theme, your magic missiles might take the form of glowing spheres of light, and your summoned monsters might emerge from mysterious rainbow-colored globes. If your theme is "lightning," your haste spell might manifest as a bright green spark that leaps from ally to ally. You can't use this feat to make your spell manifestations invisible, nor do your spell thematics change the type of damage a spell deals, regardless of its appearance. This feat supersedes the version found in Magic of Faerun.

Spellcasting Prodigy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.LevelOneFeatOnly	VISIBLE:EXPORT																																								DESC:You have an exceptional gift for magic.																																																																																									BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spellcasting Prodigy|1														SOURCEPAGE:p.44		DESC:For the purpose of determining bonus spells, treat the ability score that controls your spellcasting (Charisma for bards and sorcerers, Wisdom for divine spellcasters, or Intelligence for wizards) as 2 points higher than its actual value.
#Tenacious Magic		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Shadow Weave Magic																										DESC:You can use the Shadow Weave to make your spells harder for Weave users to dispel.																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.45		DESC:Your spells resist dispelling attempts made by Weave users. All creatures employing spells or spell-like abilities are considered Weave users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. When a Weave user makes a dispel check to dispel one of your spells (including using dispel magic to counterspell a spell you are casting), the DC is 15 + your caster level. This benefit does not extend to spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation.
Twin Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic.Wizard														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																										DESC:You can cast a spell simultaneously with another spell just like it.																																																	ADDSPELLLEVEL:4																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.46		DESC:A spell altered by this feat takes effect twice, as if you were simultaneously casting the same spell two times on the same location or against the same target. Any variables in the spell (such as targets, shaping an area, and so on) apply to both of the resulting spells. The target suffers all the effects of both spells individually and receives a saving throw for each. In some cases, such as a twinned charm person, failure of both of the target's saving throws results in redundant effects, although any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel checks to remove the effect. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling. (For example, countering with an untwinned spell doesn't negate just half of the twinned spell.) A twinned spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.

You can activate spell trigger magic items as if you had 1 level in the selected class. The selected class also becomes a favored class for you in addition to any other favored class you have or select. For example, a multiclass human fighter/rogue who selects wizard for this feat could add levels of wizard without taking any experience penalty for multiclassing in three classes. Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You may have only one regional feat. If you are a specialist wizard and you choose either sorcerer or wizard as the selected class for this feat, you may activate spell-trigger items from your opposing schools.
