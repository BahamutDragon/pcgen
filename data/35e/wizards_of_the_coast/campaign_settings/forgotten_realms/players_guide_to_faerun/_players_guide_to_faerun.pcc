INFOTEXT:The Players Guide to Faerun is the crucial book that updates the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting to DnD 3.5
INFOTEXT:So both books are defined as one source, to avoid much complication
INFOTEXT:And the Spell Compendium is such a major source of spells, it's easier to define that as necessary, than to try and replicate so much of it here
