# DG - new ability to describe Rune Scarring for the Runescarred Berserker
# Ability Name		Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type												Visible	Define													Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																Modify VAR																																																	Source Page
Runescarring										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							VISIBLE:YES															DESC:You can scribe up to 7 scars onto your body (2 each on Chest, Upper Arms, Back of Hands and 1 on the face), each imbued with a spell like ability. Scribing a runescar takes 1 hour and costs (5GP * Spell Lvl * Caster Lvl), and also costs XP equal to 1/25th the GP spent. Each scar deals 1d6 damage per spell level when scribed. It takes a standard action to touch the rune to activate it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.32



Scribe Runescar		KEY:Runescarred Berserker ~ Scribe Runescar	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Runescarred Berserker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike																		DESC:At 1st level, a runescarred berserker learns how to carve a runescar into her own skin. A runescar is a means of storing a spell, much like a scroll. The berserker knows only a limited number of spells with which to imbue runescars, selected from the runescarred berserker spell list below. To learn a runescar spell, the berserker must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell level. A runescar berserker can only cast spells by crafting them as runescars; she has no other spellcasting capability and cannot use spell completion or spell trigger magic items based on spells from this list. Scribing a runescar takes 1 hour, the expenditure of materials equal to 5 gp x spell level x caster level, and the expenditure of XP equal to 1/25th the gp spent. The character may set the caster level of the runescar at anywhere from the minimum class level necessary for her to know the rune to her own runescarred berserker class level. She may scribe a runescar only on her own body. The act of scribing a runescar is painful and deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level at the end of the scribing time. (The berserker is free to heal this damage by any normal means afterward-the runescar remains until activated.) A runescarred berserker can bear no more than seven runescars at any one time: two on the chest, two on the upper arms, two on the backs of the hands, and one on the face. Runescars are dormant until activated and cannot be dispelled (although they can be suppressed). Runescars are considered divine spells, although a berserker does not actively prepare or cast them. The save DC, if necessary, is 10 + spell level + the berserker's Wisdom score. To activate a runescar, the character must take a standard action and touch the rune. All runescar spells target only the runescarred berserker or an item in her possession, even if the spell scribed could normally be bestowed on another subject. After activation, the runescar's magic is discharged, and the rune fades to nothing but a faint outline. Typically, a berserker's skin is crisscrossed with dozens of old, discharged runescars.																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.32
