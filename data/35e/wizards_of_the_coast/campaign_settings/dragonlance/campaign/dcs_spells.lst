Bestow Curse, Greater		KEY:Bestow Curse (Greater)	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Bard=6|Cleric=7|Sorcerer,Wizard=8							SCHOOL:Necromancy															COMPS:V,S										CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Creature touched																								DURATION:Permanent						SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.104
Billim's Bifrost Bridge											CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation										COMPS:V, S, M									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:Crystal bridge whose area is up to two 5-ft. squares/level (see text)															DURATION:1 minute/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:This spell causes an anchored bridge of solid crystal to form, stretching from two areas indicated during the casting (both of which must be in range of the spell) to join in the center. The bridge cannot form in an area accupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. It can join two areas of differing heights, as long as the bridge does not climb or descend at an angle of more than 45 degrees (in other words, the vertical distance cannot exceed the horizontal distance between its anchor points). The bifrost bridge is 1 inch thick per four caster level. It can support up to 1,000 pounds of weight per inch of thickness. If the weight limit is exceeded, the bridge instantly crumbles into a fine white powder and vanishes in 1 round. Each 5-foot square of the bridge has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the bridge automatically, but it has hardness 5. If any part of the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, the entire bifrist bridge collapses. Material Component: A rectangular piece of quartz.
Crackling Sphere												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity						COMPS:V, S, M									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:3-ft.-radius sphere																							DURATION:1 round/level (D)					SAVEINFO:Reflex negates			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:A crackling globe of electricity flied in whichever direction you point, electrocuting those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round, though if it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d4 points of electrical damage for every two levels of the spellcaster (maximum 5d4). (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save.) The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and crackles. The surface of the sphere is yielding, so does not cause damage except from the electricity. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
Dalamar's Lightning Lance										CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity						COMPS:V, S, M									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:1 lightning-lance/five levels																						DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fortitude half (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:You create a crackling lance of lightning that you can hurl at your foes. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack roll to hit. The lance deals 3d6 points of damage from the impact of the strike, plus 1d6 electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The impact damage is not subject to being reduced by protection from the elements (electricity), spark shield, and similar magic or effects, but the target is entitled a Fortitude save to halve the electricity damage. You can create and hurl a second lightning-lance at 10th level, and a third at 15th level. All bolts must be aimed at enemies within 30 feet of each other. Material Component: An amber, crystal, or glass rod.
Deep Freeze													CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Cold							COMPS:V, S, M	COMPS:A silver charm shaped like a snowflake.	CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Creature touched																								DURATION:1 round/level (see text)				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You cause the creature touched to slowly freeze into a block of ice. You must succeed at a melee touch attack, at which point the traget creature is allowed a saving throw to resist the magic. If the creature fails, you deal 6d6 points of subdual damage to the target, and the target suffers a -4 penalty on all attacks, saves, and checks for the duration of the spell. Each round, the target takes an additional 6d6 points of subdual damage on your action. The deep freeze can be dispelled noamally during this time. If the target is rendered unconscious while under the spell's effect, it freezes solid (along with all worn, carried, or held items), becoming an inert statue of living ice. The creature is not dead, but exists in a state of suspended animation from which it can only be revived though break enchantment, limited wish, wish, or miracle. If not revived, the creature remains in the deep freeze for a period of 1 year per caster level. Material
Disjoin													CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6								SCHOOL:Abjuration															COMPS:V, S, XP									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)	TARGETAREA:One creature, magical effect, or object																				DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You choose a single magical effect or magic item to disjoin. A disjoined spell or magic item is separated into its individual magic components. This ends a spell or spell-like effect in the same manner as dispel magic. A permanent magic item is suppressed (inoperative) for 1 round per caster level, and must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's, whichever is better. If you cast this spell on a creature, you can shoose to target a specific item or spell effect on that creature. If you do not designate a specific spell effect or item, disjoin affects a randomly determined spell effect or magic item affecting the creature or in its possession. XP Cost: 200 XP
Divine Retribution											CLASSES:Cleric=9											SCHOOL:Abjuration															COMPS:V, S, DF									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:10 minutes/level															SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You select a single form of attack (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or force) when you cast this spell. For the duration of the spell, any attack based upon that element that strikes the caster is absorbed and instantly reflected upon the originator of the attack. Effect, area, and touch range spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that use the named form of energy are all equally affected. Ehen it is reflected, the effect is altered, becoming either Sacred or Profane (depending upon the alignment of the cleric's deity), thus a creature that may normalyy be immune to its own attacks may now be vulnerable instead. This Sacred/Profane attack is equally effective, egardless of the actually alignment of the originator. For example, a cleric of Sargonnas casts divine retribution upon herself, selecting fire to be protected against, knowing she is to face a red dragon. When the red dragon uses his fire breath, the divine retribution absorbs the damage and returns it upon the dragon as a Profane attack, though it resembles the same fiery breath and the dragon's chaotic evil alignment. The creature is still allowed spell resistance and a saving throw against its own attack.
Drown										TYPE:Divine			CLASSES:Druid=6											SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Water							COMPS:V,S										CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One living creature																							DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates		SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Earthen Shield												CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3								SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation										COMPS:V, S										CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:Wall of earth up 5 feet long/level and 1 foot thick (S)																	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:This spell creates a small, localized wall of earth, which rises from the ground. You create one wall section 5 feet long, 5 feet tall, and 1 foot thick per level. For example, a 7th-level caster would create a wall 5 feet tall and 1 foot thick that was 20 feet long and then turned and continued another 15 feet. The earthen shield cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The earthen shield must be vertical and must rest upon a firm foundation, merging with existing earth. You can make the wall up to 10 feet tall by stacking one section on top of another, but that is the maximum height the earthen shield can reach. You can make the wall 2 or more feet thick by stacking one section behind another. The earthen shield is defensive in nature, used to provide cover from attackers. Each 5-foot length of the shield has 100 hit points per foot of thickness. Creatures can hit the shield automatically, and its hardness is 0. A section of shield whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. if a creature tries to break through the wall with a single effort, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + 5 per foot of thickness (on a successful check, a 5-foot section of the wall is destroyed). The earthen shield requires a DC 15 climb check.
Electrical Storm												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity						COMPS:V, S, M									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:Cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)																				DURATION:1 round/level (D)					SAVEINFO:Fortitude half			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:Crackling bolts of electricity arc through the spell's area, dealing 4d6 electricity damage to all creatures within (Fort save half). A creature that fails on its Fortitude save is dazed for 1 round. Any creature thet enters the spell's area is subject to its effects as soon as it sets foot in the electrical storm. In addition, on your next turn in each following round, any creature currently in the electrical storm takes damage and must save agin as described above. Material Component: A small copper key.
Elemental Dart												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Air|Cold|Earth|Electricity|Fire|Water	COMPS:V, S										CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:Up to five creatures or objects, no two of which can be more 30 ft. apart														DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:Fortitude half			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:From raw elemental matter, you form a magical dart of energy that streaks forward and strikes the target you designate. You choose to create an acid, cold, electricity, or fire dart when you cast the spell. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The dart deals 1d6 point of damage, +1 point per caster level (maximum 1d6+10). A creature struck by a dart can attempt a Fortitude save for half damage. You can't single out specific parts of a creature to attack. Unlike magic missile, you can damage inanimate objects with an elemental dart. At every odd caster level past 3rd, you gain an additional dart. You create two darts at 5th level, three at 7th level, four at 9th level, and the maximum number of five darts at 11th level or higher. You can attack with multiple darts in the same action in which you cast elemental dart at no penalty. If oyu fire multiple darts, you can have them strike a single target or several targets. A single dart can strike only one target. You must designate targets before you make attack rolls, check for spell resistance, or roll damage. Since the darts are composed of elemental energy, they may deal greater damage against targets susceptible to elemental damage - such as using a fire dart against a white dragon, for example. Additionally, it is possible to be protected against elemental darts by appropriate spells, such as protection from elements, resist elements, and the like.
Fistandantilus's Portal											CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8									SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation										COMPS:V, S, M, XP									CASTTIME:3 rounds			RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:See text																									DURATION:Concentration + 1 round				SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:Casting Fistandantilus's portal opens an interdimensional connection between two places on the same plane of existence, allowing travel between the locations in either direction. The portal itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. The portal has a front and back. Creatures moving through the portal from the front are transported to the other location; creatures moving through it from the back are not. The interdimensional connection is forged through the Astral Plane, so anything that blocks astral travel will also block the usage of the portal. Much like the teleportation spell, you must have a clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. You can't create a portal if you don't know where the terminus will end up. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the portal will form. Areas of strong physical or magical energies may make traversing a portal more hazadous or even impossible. Use the following table to determine the success of the portal's opening: Material Component: Ruby dust that is used to form the outline of the portal (cost 1,000 gp). XP-Cost: 500 XP
Hardening													CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6			DOMAINS:Forge=7				SCHOOL:Transmutation														COMPS:V, S, M									CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One item of a volume no greater that 10 cu. ft./level (see text)																DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:Yes (object)	SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:This spell increases the hardness of materials (see Table 8-12: Substances Hardness and Hit Points in the Player's Handbook). Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every two caster levels, increase by 1 the hardness of the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material's resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (base hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have a new hardness of 16 for purpose of ignoring damage caused by someone using the sunder action. The sword's hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other characteristics are not affected. The hardening spell does not in any way affect resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on. This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet per level of the spellcaster. If cast upon a metal or mineral, the volume is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level. Material Component: A pinch of diamond dust worth at least 100 gp per cubic foot of the item to be hardened.
Magius's Light of Truth											CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Lawful|Light						COMPS:V, S, AF, XP								CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:Instantaneous	TARGETAREA:120 ft. cone																													SAVEINFO:Will partial			SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:The spell used by Palin to help defeat the Chaos during the Chaos War, Magius's light of truth was developed by the famous war-mage during the time of Huma, though it had never before been used until it was given to Palin by his uncle, the archamge Raistlin Majere, with the permission of the Orders of High Sorcery. When this spell is cast, it creates a radiant cone of pure light, drawing it from the spirit of the spellcaster and channeling it through an artifact of light. Against nonlawful creatures, the spell has multiple effects, depending upon the creature's alignment. If the spellcaster is on his home plane, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least one day per caster level. Any creatures of neutrality (neutral good, neutral, neutral evil) caught within the cone of light are dazed 1d6 rounds and are dealt 3d6 points of damage (a successful Will save negates the daze effect and reduces the damage by one-half). Against creatures of chaos (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, chaotic evil) light of truth deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half damage if a Will save is successful. If the creature fails on its Will save, it is subject to additional effects depending upon its Hit Dice:	DESC:&nl;Hit Dice / Effect	DESC:&nl;15 or more - Dazed	DESC:&nl;Less than 15 - Stunned, dazed	DESC:&nl;Less than 10 - Paralyzed, stunned, dazed	DESC:&nl;Less than 5 - Killed, paralyzed, stunned, dazed The effects are cumulative. Dazed: The creature is dazed 1d6 rounds. Stunned: The creature is stunned 2d6 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed for 2d6 minutes. Killed: Living creatures die. Constructs and undead creatures are destroyed. Focus: An artifact or intelligent magic item (minimum caster level 15th) of lawful alignment. XP Cost: 500 XP

When you cast this spell, you summon gouts of flame from the ground, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage to all within the area of effect. In addition, any creature affected must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire (see Catching on Fire in the Dungeon's Master Guide). Material Component: A small cylinder of sulfur soaked in a drop of oil.
Plague of Rats								TYPE:Divine										DOMAINS:Pestilence (Dragonlance)=5	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning										COMPS:V,S,DF									CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:One swarm of rats/2 levels, each of which is adjacent to at least one other swarm													DURATION:1 round/level												SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.110

Share Animal's Mind											CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=3										SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting					COMPS:V, S, AF									CASTTIME:1 full round		RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:One animal of Medium size or smaller																					DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:You take control of the target animal's body. For as long as you maintain concentration, you see through the animal's eyes and control over the animal's actions. You receive the input of the animal's senses and can make use of all its special attacks and qualities. You can undertake any action the animal can physically accomplish, even if the animal would normally lack the intelligence to perform the action in question. You can control the animal at a distance of up to 1 mile (the spell's range only applies when you first establish control of the animal). If you force the animal to perform actions contrary to its nature or exceedingly dangerous (such as forcing the animal to walk off a cliff, or fly down the gullet of a dragon, for example), the animal is allowed another saving throw. Attacking foes who are one size larger than the animal (or smaller) is not exceedingly dangerous and does not provide the animal with an opportunity to make another saving throw. While you control the animal, you are limited to a single move action every round in your own body. You can still see through your own eyes and defend yourself normally. When in doubt whether something is an "animal" as defined by the spell, check Monster Manual ( the creature's type must be Animal). Focus: A piece of clay molded to approximate the chosen animal's form.
Shocking Spark												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity						COMPS:V, S, M									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One creature or object																							DURATION:Instantaneous						SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:Yes (object)	SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:A powerful crackling spark of electricity arcs from your hand at the target you designate. Make a ranged touch attack; if you hit, you deal 4d6 points of electricity damage. If the opponent is wearing metal armor (or made out of metal, carrying a lot of metal, or similar conditions), you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to attack, dealing x3 damage on critical. You create a second spark at 6th level, and a third spark at 10th level (the maximum effect). Material Component: An iron ring
Spark Shield												CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=4								SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity						COMPS:V, S, M, DF									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:1 round/level (D)					SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:This spell surrounds you in an aura of crackling electricity, both offering protection against electrical attacks as well as causing damage to each creature who attacks in melee. Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d4 points of electrical damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). If they strike you with a metal weapon, or are wearing metal armor, or carrying a lot of metal, they take 2d4 points of electrical damage +2 points per caster level (maximum +15). If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you unless the weapon is at leat 1/2 metal in composition (a spear or polearm is not). Against electrical attacks, you take only half damage. If that attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. When casting this spell, you appear to be sheated in tiny lightning bolts that undulate across your body. The electricity provides equal illumination to a torch (20 feet). The color of the electricity is blue-white, though the color can be almost any hue as determined by the caster. Arcane Material Component: Two thin copper bracelets, one worn on each wrist.
Spirit Walk													CLASSES:Cleric=6|Sorcerer,Wizard=7								SCHOOL:Necromancy															COMPS:V, S, AF, DF								CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:1 round/level (D)															SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:By focusing your energy, you are able to separate your spirit from your body, allowing it to travel anywhere on the same plane of existence. Distance is not a factor, but the locale to be visited in your spirit form must be known - a place familiar to you. While in your spirit form, you can see and hear things, just as if you were there. You can also be seen and be heard, though you are unable to actually interact in that location. You cannot cast spells through your spirit form, nor does it allow magically enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see up to 10 feet away. Lead sheeting or magical protection (such as antimagic field, mind blank, or nondetection) blocks you from noticing individuals in the area you have traveled to, though you can feel that your senses are being blocked somehow. While your spirit is out of your body, your body is paralyzed and completely helpless. Arcane Focus: A quartz or obsidian figurine.
Stone Shards												CLASSES:Sorcerer,Spellthief,Wizard=2							SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Earth							COMPS:V, S										CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One stone/3 levels																								DURATION:1 minute/level or until used			SAVEINFO:Reflex negates (see text)	SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:This spell enables you to transform ordinary stones (no larger than a sling bullet) into explosive, grenadelike weapons. Throwing a stone is a standard action. The stones have a range increment of 20 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target with one of the transmuted stones. Each stone bursts upon striking the target or any hard surface. A direct hit from one of the exploding stones deals 2d6 points of damage to the target, and 1d6 points of damage to those within 5 feet of the point of impact. A creature struck directly with one of the stones is not entitled to a saving throw, but those within the blast area are allowed to make a Reflex saving throw to negate the damage.
Storm Wall													CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4									SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity						COMPS:V, S, M									CASTTIME:1 action			RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:Opaque sheet of electricity up to 20 ft. long/caster level or a ring of lightning with a radius of up to 5 ft./2 caster levels; either form 20 ft. high	DURATION:Concentration + 1 round/level			SAVEINFO:See text				SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCELONG:Dragonlance Campaign Setting	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:An immobile, sparking curtain of radiant electricity springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth miniature bolts of lightning, causing 2d4 points of electricity damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of electricity damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d4 points of electrical damage +1 point of electrical damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to metal creatures, creatures wearing metal armor or carrying a lot of metal objects. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall by making a successful Reflex save. (If the creature ends up on the sparking side of the wall, it takes 2d4 points of damage, as normal.) The storm wall can be smothered by using enough dirt or sand to ground the electricity. For each cubic foot of sand used, one corresponding foot of the wall can be smothered. Material Component: A lodestone.

The talons give you two natural claw attacks per round, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage (plus Strength modifier) per successful melee attack. You can instead attack with a weapon in one hand, and make a claw attack with yout other hand as a secondary attack (-5 on your attack roll, and half Strength modifier on the damage roll) without penalizing your primary attack. You are considered armed.
