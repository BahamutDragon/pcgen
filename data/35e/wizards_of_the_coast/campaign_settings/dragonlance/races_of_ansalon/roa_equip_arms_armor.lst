#####
#The Dagger is an Example of a weapon, while the Saddlebags is an item that is set up to be used as a container for other
#items. The first field is the item's name and is required.
#
#The PROFICIENCY tag is only used with weapons, armor and shields. It tells PCGen what Weapon Proficiency name to use from the weapprofs.lst, armorprofs.lst or shieldprofs.lst file.
#
#The TYPE tag is used for many filtering and PRExxx tags. TYPE:Armor items should also have the type of SLOTS it uses. This
#is usually TYPE:Suit. TYPE:Container is a special type name. It activates the CONTAINS tag in the item. Every TYPE:Weapon
#item must be also have either TYPE:Melee or TYPE:Ranged (TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Foo). TYPE:Double is a special weapon tag. It
#activates three ALTxxx tags for the second head statistics.
#
#The CONTAINS tag is used to define how much and what a container can hold. Any object with CONTAINS must also be TYPE:Container
#for the CONTAINS tag to be activated.
#
#The COST tag sets the cost of the item.
#
#The WT tag is holding the item's weight.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the item. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#CRITMULT, CRITRANGE, DAMAGE, WIELD, and RANGE are tags that are associated with weapons. They can be used to set up the
#various weapon stats.

#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Item. F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,
#C=Colossal.

#The EQMOD tag calls an equipment modifier to be applied to the base item before looking at other tags. You will need to use
#the equipment modifier's KEY with this tag, not it's name.
