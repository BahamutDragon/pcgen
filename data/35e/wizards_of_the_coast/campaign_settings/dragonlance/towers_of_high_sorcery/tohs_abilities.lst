#Magic of Betrayal		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Betrayal	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.BlackOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Black Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, a Black Robe wizard who knows this secret may Empower or Extend any necromancy spell she casts. The spell functions as though she had applied the appropriate metamagic feat, but does not use a higher-level spell slot. When she does so, a backlash of negative energy deals 2d6 points of damage to a single living ally within 30 feet, chosen by the wizard (who may not choose an undead ally, who would benefit from the negative energy). The ally is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + one-half caster level + Intelligence modifier) for half damage.
#Magic of Darkness		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Darkness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.BlackOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Black Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, a Black Robe wizard who knows this secret can imbue a damaging spell with negative energy. Half of the damage dealt by such a spell is negative energy damage, and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy or similar magic (although death ward negates it). The remainder of the damage is dealt as normal for the spell. Undead are healed by negative energy, so damage dealt to undead creatures simply averages out to nothing for a spell modified in this way. (Assume that the healing takes place first, granting the undead creature temporary hit points above its maximum if necessary, with equivalent damage then dealt to leave the creature back where it started.)
#Magic of Fear		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Fear		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.BlackOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Black Order	DESC:A Black Robe wizard who knows this secret can make her spells more intimidating. As a full-round action, the wizard can cast any spell that deals damage and has a normal casting time of 1 standard action. Then, as a free action, she can immediately attempt to demoralize one opponent within 30 feet by making an Intimidate check against the opponent's modified character level (see the Intimidate skill, page 76 of the Player's Handbook). The wizard receives a circumstance bonus on the Intimidate check equal to the level of the spell she casts.
#Magic of Hunger		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Hunger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.BlackOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Black Order	DESC:A Black Robe wizard who knows this secret may draw even further upon her own resources to increase the scope of her magic. Each day, she may prepare one extra spell of any level she can cast at the cost of 1 point of Constitution damage per spell level. This ability damage heals normally but cannot be magically restored.
#Magic of Pain		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Pain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.BlackOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Black Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, the Black Robe wizard who knows this secret may cast any spell that deals hit point damage to inflict pain beyond the spell's normal effects. Any creature damaged by such a spell must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + Constitution modifier) or suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for one round due to the lingering pain the spell inflicts. As a price for this wracking pain, the Black Robe herself takes 1d6 points of damage when the spell is cast.
#Red
#Magic of Change		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Change		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.RedOrder		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Red Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, a wizard who knows this secret may Enlarge or Extend any transmutation spell he casts. The spell functions as though he had applied the appropriate metamagic feat, but does not use a higher-level spell slot.
#Magic of Deception	KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Deception	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.RedOrder		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Red Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, a wizard who knows this secret may Enlarge or Extend any Illusion spell he casts. The spell functions as though he had applied the appropriate metamagic feat, but does not use a higher-level spell slot.
#Magic of Independence	KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Independence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.RedOrder		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Red Order	DESC:A Red Robe wizard who knows this secret casts spells that are harder to dispel. When another spellcaster makes a dispel check against one of the wizard's spells (including using dispel magic to counterspell a spell the wizard is casting), the DC is 15 + the wizard's caster level.
#Magic of Mystery		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Mystery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.RedOrder		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Red Order	DESC:A Red Robe wizard who knows this secret casts spells that are harder to detect and identify. When another spellcaster attempts to use a divination spell (such as detect magic), or a spell-like ability or magic item that might detect the magical aura of one of the wizard's spells, the other caster must make a level check (DC 11 + the wizard's caster level) to successfully detect the spell. Similarly, a spellcaster attempting to use a divination (such as see invisibility) to reveal the effects of one of the wizard's spells must make a level check to reveal the spell's effects. Any given caster can check only once for each divination spell or effect used, no matter how many of the wizard's spell effects may be operating in an area. In addition, when another spellcaster attempts to identify the spell a Red Robe wizard is casting (for instance, to counterspell it), the DC of the required Spellcraft check is increased by +1 for every 2 class levels the Red Robe wizard has attained.
#Magic of Purity		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Purity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.RedOrder		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ Red Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, a Red Robe wizard who knows this secret can imbue any spell that deals hit point damage with pure arcane energy. Half of the damage dealt by such a spell comes from this arcane energy, and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy or similar magic. The remainder of the damage is dealt as normal for the spell.
#White
#Magic of Defense		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Defense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.WhiteOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ White Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, a wizard who knows this secret may Empower or Extend any Abjuration spell she casts. The spell functions as though she had applied the appropriate metamagic feat, but does not use a higher-level spell slot.
#Magic of Radiance		KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Radiance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.WhiteOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ White Order	DESC:Once per day for every two class levels attained, a White Robe wizard who knows this secret can imbue any spell that deals hit point damage with radiant energy. Half of the damage dealt by such a spell comes from this radiant energy, and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy or similar magic. The remainder of the damage dealt is as normal for the spell. Against undead, a spell modified in this way deals half again as much damage as normal (double the radiant energy damage). As a side effect, radiant spells give off as much illumination as a light spell of equivalent caster level, and this light lingers in the area for one round after the end of the spell's duration (or one round for an instantaneous spell).
#Magic of Resistance	KEY:Order Secret ~ Magic of Resistance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard of High Sorcery Order Secret.WhiteOrder	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Wizard of High Sorcery ~ White Order	DESC:This secret allows a White Robe wizard to more easily counter or dispel the magic cast by others.

The wizard gains a competence bonus equal to +1 per two class levels on all Concentration checks made to cast or direct spells (but does not gain a Concentration check bonus while casting defensively).
