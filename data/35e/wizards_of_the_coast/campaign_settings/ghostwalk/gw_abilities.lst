Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Arboreal Guardian ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arboreal Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Arboreal Guardians gain proficiency with shortbows (but not composite shortbows). A druid who becomes an Arboreal Guardian can use a shortbow without violating her spiritual oaths. Arboreal Guardians gain no proficiency with any armor or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																							AUTO:WEAPONPROF|Shortbow																						SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Spellcasting			KEY:Arboreal Guardian ~ Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arboreal Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:An Arboreal Guardian continues training in magic. Thus, at every other Arboreal Guardian level starting at 2nd, the character gains new spells known and spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, additional uses of wild shape, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of Arboreal Guardian to the level of some other divine spellcasting class she has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Bond's Call				KEY:Arboreal Guardian ~ Bond's Call				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arboreal Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:An Arboreal Guardian may make an Intuit Direction check (DC 15) to determine the direction to her spirit tree.

Unhindered Charge			KEY:Arboreal Guardian ~ Unhindered Charge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arboreal Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:When making a charge or taking the run action, an Arboreal Guardian of 3rd level or higher can pass unhindered through normal inanimate living plants, similar to a druid's woodland stride ability. Unlike woodland stride, she can also pass unhindered through larger plants such as trees, including her own spirit tree, when using this ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Wood Speech				KEY:Arboreal Guardian ~ Wood Speech				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arboreal Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:An Arboreal Guardian of 3rd level or higher can telepathically communicate with her spirit tree or with any of its other Arboreal Guardians at a range of 1 mile. This allows the Guardian to initiate the telepathic contact (previously she could be contacted by her spirit tree, but could not initiate this contact).																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Hunter's Mercy			KEY:Arboreal Guardian ~ Hunter's Mercy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arboreal Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:Once per day as a standard action, a Guardian of 5th level or higher can focus her concentration so her first successful attack with a bow in the next round is automatically a critical hit. This works like the hunter's mercy spell, except that activating this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity.																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Blindsight				KEY:Arboreal Guardian ~ Blindsight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arboreal Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:Like her bonded spirit tree, a Guardian of 5th level or higher can sense creatures without using her eyes, giving her the blindsight ability with a range of 30 feet. She can activate this ability once per day as a free action, lasting a number of rounds equal to her class level.

# Bone Collector
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Bone Collector ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Bone collectors gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Spells				KEY:Bone Collector ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:A bone collector has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the bone collector must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a bone collector with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Bone collector bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the bone collector's Wisdom modifier (if any). When the bone collector gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, she gets only bonus spells. The bone collector's spell list appears below. A bone collector prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does.

Recognize Undead			KEY:Bone Collector ~ Recognize Undead			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:A bone collector has trained her senses to such an extent than she can more easily recognize an undead creature for what it is. She gains a +4 bonus on Spot checks or Will saving throws to penetrate an undead's disguise or an illusion spell that changes its appearance. If an undead creature is not attempting to disguise its nature or naturally appears much like a living creature, the bone collector gains a Spot check (DC 10 + undead's Cha modifier) to realize the creature is undead. See the description of the Disguise skill in the Player's Handbook for information on repeat attempts to penetrate a disguise.																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Lesser Bone Armor			KEY:Bone Collector ~ Lesser Bone Armor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Using her knowledge of undeath and magic, a bone collector can craft certain kinds of magical armor (including shields) that imitate or hamper undead abilities. She can craft armor with a +1 enhancement bonus or imbue magic armor with any of the following properties: death ward, energy drain, shadow, silent moves. This ability works as if she had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat and met all prerequisites for the abilities being added (so she could create shadow armor even if she didn't otherwise have access to the invisibility prerequisite of the shadow property). All other rules for creating magic armor apply (cost to create, creation time, and so on). Any armor the bone collector crafts bears a noticeable motif of death; it may be decorated with actual bones, bear images of skulls, and so on. A bone collector with another spellcasting class and the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat adds her class level to her other spellcasting class level to determine her effective caster level for meeting the special requirement for crafting armor with enhancement bonuses, so a Clr8/Bone collector 4 is counted as a 12th-level spellcaster for the purpose of crafting magic armor and therefore could craft armor with a +4 enhancement bonus (see Creating Armor in Chapter 8 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide).																																SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Lesser Bone Weapon		KEY:Bone Collector ~ Lesser Bone Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:In a fashion similar to the lesser bone armor ability, a bone collector of 2nd level or higher can craft certain kinds of magic weapons that imitate undead attacks or harm undead. She can craft weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus or can imbue magic weapons with any of the following properties: flaming, ghost touch, truesilver. This ability works as if she had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat and met all prerequisites for the abilities being added (so she could create a flaming weapon even if she didn't otherwise have access to the fireball prerequisite of the flaming property). All other rules for creating magic weapons apply (cost to create, creation time, and so on). Any weapon the bone collector crafts bears a noticeable motif of death; it may be decorated with actual bones, bear images of skulls, and so on. A bone collector with another spellcasting class and the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat adds her class level to her other spellcasting class level to determine her effective caster level for meeting the special requirement for crafting weapons with enhancement bonuses, so a Clr8/Bone collector 4 is counted as a 12th-level spellcaster for the purpose of crafting magic weapons and therefore could craft a weapon with a +4 enhancement bonus (see Creating Weapons in Chapter 8 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide).																											SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Negative Energy Shroud		KEY:Bone Collector ~ Negative Energy Shroud		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:By surrounding herself with a weak aura of negative energy, a bone collector of 3rd level or higher can confuse attempts to discern her living nature. Undead creatures perceive her as a fellow undead, spells such as detect undead and deathwatch perceive her as an undead creature, and so on. Mindless undead ignore her unless they have specific orders to attack other undead creatures, and intelligent ones are likely to assume she is a vampire or other sort of undead that looks alive. The shroud gives her a +2 bonus on saving throws against attacks based on negative energy (such as enervation and inflict spells), but causes all healing spells cast upon her to cure only half the normal damage. Actions by the bone collector may give observers clues to her living state (such as reacting to pain or holding her breath when entering water). Attacking an undead creature causes this ability to end immediately. This ability may be used once per day and lasts up to 10 minutes per class level. [1/day for up to %1 minutes]|BoneCollectorLVL*10																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Greater Bone Armor		KEY:Bone Collector ~ Greater Bone Armor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:In a fashion similar to the lesser bone armor ability, a bone collector of 4th level or higher can craft armor (including shields) with up to a +3 enhancement bonus or with the following properties: absorbing, cold resistance, etherealness, ghost touch.																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Greater Bone Weapon		KEY:Bone Collector ~ Greater Bone Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:A bone collector of 5th level or higher can craft weapons with up to a +3 enhancement bonus or with the following properties: disruption, flaming burst, ghost bane, undead bane, vampiric.																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Undead Channel			KEY:Bone Collector ~ Undead Channel				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bone Collector Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:Once per day, a 6th-level bone collector may absorb any one magical effect from an undead creature's attack, such as an ability score drain or damage, a negative level, a corrupting touch, or a paralyzing touch. This absorption does not require a readied action and can be activated by a bone collector in response to an attack by an undead. The absorbed attack has no effect upon the bone collector, but remains as a stored magical effect within her body up to 24 hours after the attack. She may activate this stored effect as a free action and discharge it upon a target by making a touch attack, affecting the target as if the original undead creature were making the attack. Once activated, the stored effect works like a touch spell and triggers upon the next creature or object she touches.

SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Spellcasting			KEY:Deathwarden Chanter ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deathwarden Chanter Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:A Deathwarden chanter continues training in divine magic. Thus, when a new Deathwarden chanter level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (additional uses of wild shape, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of Deathwarden chanter to the level of some other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Smite Undead			KEY:Deathwarden Chanter ~ Smite Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deathwarden Chanter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DEFINE:SmiteUndeadTimesPerDay|0				DESC:With this ability, a chanter can attempt to smite undead with a normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. This extra damage is from positive energy and is not affected by damage reduction. If the chanter accidentally smites a creature that is not undead, the smite has no effect but is still used up. If the chanter has a smite ability from another class (such as paladin), he may use that smite ability separately or combine them into a single strike if the target meets all criteria for all smites (such as evil and undead for a paladin/chanter).

Iron Soul				KEY:Deathwarden Chanter ~ Iron Soul					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deathwarden Chanter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:Upon attaining 2nd level, a Deathwarden chanter gets a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects and on saving throws to remove a negative level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Great Rune				KEY:Deathwarden Chanter ~ Great Rune				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deathwarden Chanter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike							DEFINE:GreatRuneLevel|0	DEFINE:POOL_Great_Rune|0	DESC:Deathwarden chanters come to understand how to create powerful runes, which they can inscribe on items and locations. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the chanter chooses one rune from Table 1-6: Deathwarden Chanter Runes. His level + Wisdom modifier determines how many runes he can choose from at any given time. He can't choose the same rune twice. A rune must be drawn, painted, or engraved on a solid surface or object. Some are active runes, which begin functioning as soon as they are completed, while others are passive runes, triggered by certain conditions set at the time of the rune's creation. Passive runes are given triggering conditions similar to a glyph of warding and protect an area up to 5 square feet per caster level. This area may be a flat surface, an object, a doorway, or a section of corridor. Some runes require a sacrifice by the chanter. For example, a rune that functions like a spell glyph from a glyph of warding requires the chanter to use one of his spell slots to power that rune. Until the rune is triggered or negated, the chanter cannot use that spell slot. Once the rune is triggered or negated, the chanter can once again prepare spells with that slot after his next period of rest and time of prayer. Drawing a rune takes 10 minutes and requires concentration, just as if the chanter were casting a spell. A chanter can finish all but the last symbol of a rune, allowing him to finish it later as a single standard action (a chanter can complete another chanter's rune only if he knows that rune and succeeds on a Spellcraft check against DC 20). However, an incomplete rune is vulnerable to outside interference-any creature walking upon or disturbing the incomplete rune negates it entirely, just as if it were a spell that had been interrupted during casting. A completed rune is anywhere from 1 to 5 feet in diameter, depending on the desires of the chanter who created it. Once completed, a rune is no more difficult to notice than an ordinary drawing. Safely removing a rune requires the use of dispel magic or a similar spell (the dispel check is made against the caster level of the chanter who created it) or a Disable Device check (DC 25 + 1/2 chanter's class level + chanter's Wis modifier). For runes that have saving throws, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 chanter's class level + chanter's Wis modifier. A chanter can dissipate one of his own runes by touching it and spending a standard action concentrating on it. If the dissipated rune requires a sacrifice to create it (such as a spell slot), the sacrificed ability cannot be used until the rune is discharged or dissipated, after which it returns at the normal rate for its type (such as after 8 hours of rest, when other spells are prepared). All runes have a duration of "permanent until discharged" unless otherwise stated.

Deep Chant				KEY:Deathwarden Chanter ~ Deep Chant				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deathwarden Chanter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DEFINE:DeepChantTimesPerDay|0					DESC:This ability, gained by a chanter at 5th level, has two different functions, both of which require a full-round action and only one of which can be used per day. First, it can be used to send a telepathic message to all Deathwarden dwarves within a 1- mile radius of the chanter's location. This message can be no more than ten words long. Second, a deep chant can act as a boosted turn undead attempt, as if the chanter had the Divine Energy Focus feat. This does not count toward his normal number of turning attempts per day and does not stack with the Divine Energy Focus feat.

The chanter uses his caster level, not his chanter level, to determine the modifier to the effect's save DC. This ability works even if the ghost is within the Manifest Ward.

# Runes
Spell Rune (Passive)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Spell Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,1										DESC:This rune functions like the spell glyph version of a glyph of warding. The chanter sacrifices a cleric spell slot of the stored spell's level to power the rune, so a rune of hold person would use one of the chanter's 2nd-level cleric spell slots. The target's save DC is based on the chanter's rune save DC and not the save DC of the spell.
Ward Rune (Passive)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Ward Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,2										DESC:A chanter must have the deep chant ability to learn this rune. The ward rune is a powerful alarm with two effects. First, the creature that triggers the rune must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. Second, the rune acts as the first form of the deep chant ability (see below), transmitting a short message to all Deathwarden dwarves within 1 mile. A chanter can have only one of these runes in effect at any time; creating a second one causes the first one to dissipate.
Turning Rune (Passive)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Turning Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,3										DESC:A chanter must sacrifice one use of his turn undead ability to create this rune. When triggered, the rune activates as if the chanter himself were using his turn undead ability at that location. This rune is often used to protect sites that suffer frequent attacks by undead that otherwise would not have a cleric protecting them.
Armor Rune (Active)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Armor Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,4										DESC:When completed, the rune emanates a magic vestment spell to a radius of 5 feet, affecting all allies of the chanter within this emanation. The power of the rune lasts 12 hours. A chanter can have only one of these runes in effect at any time; creating a second one causes the first one to dissipate.
Thunder Rune (Active)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Thunder Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,5										DESC:When this rune is completed, a loud peal of thunder erupts from it. All enemies within 60 feet of the rune are dazed for 1 round and must make Fortitude saves or be deafened. This is a sonic effect. The deafness is similar to that caused by a thunderstone (permanent, but cannot be negated with dispel magic or similar spells, although remove deafness works). A chanter can draw this rune once per day.
Law Rune (Active)			KEY:Great Rune ~ Law Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,6										DESC:This rune affects creatures within 60 feet of it, providing all lawful beings a +2 competence bonus on saving throws and increasing the DC of all law spells cast from within this area by 2. A chanter can have only one of these runes in effect at any time; creating a second one causes the first one to dissipate.
Clan Rune (Active)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Clan Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,7										DESC:All dwarves within 30 feet of this rune gain a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks. This effect begins once the rune is inscribed and lasts 24 hours. A chanter can have only one of these runes in effect at any time; creating a second one causes the first one to dissipate.
Veil Rune (Active)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Veil Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,8										DESC:This rune draws upon the power of the Veil itself. Living creatures within 60 feet of the rune are fatigued as the power of the Veil saps their life energy (leaving the area negates the fatigue). Ghosts within 60 feet of the rune must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 chanter's class level + chanter's Cha modifier) every round or succumb to the Calling. Up to 20 creatures can be excluded from this effect; the names of these creatures are written into the rune during its creation. A chanter can draw this rune once per day.
Song Rune (Active)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Song Rune						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,9										DESC:This rune constantly emits a low chant in the language of the Deathwardens. All allies of the chanter within 60 feet of the rune gain three benefits. First, they are immune to fear effects. Second, they stabilize automatically when their hit points drop to -1 or lower (as if wearing a periapt of wound closure). Third, they gain a +2 bonus on saves against sonic effects. The rune lasts 1 minute per class level. A chanter can have only one of these runes in effect at any time; creating a second one causes the first one to dissipate.
Ancestor Rune (Active)		KEY:Great Rune ~ Ancestor Rune					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Great Rune.SpecialQuality							PREVARGTEQ:GreatRuneLevel,10										DESC:This powerful rune calls one of the chanter's dead ancestors back from beyond the Veil to fight on his behalf. The rune acts as a planar ally spell, but always summons a dwarf cleric or fighter with the celestial or fiendish template and with a class level no greater than the chanter's caster level. Completing this rune is very draining, and for an entire week after its completion, the chanter gains two negative levels. These negative levels never result in actual level loss and cannot be removed in any way (including by restoration spells) before the week is over. During the creation of this rune, the chanter sacrifices 100 gp worth of treasure or magic items per level of the ancestor called. The ancestor remains for no more than 6 hours. A chanter can use this rune no more than once per week.
