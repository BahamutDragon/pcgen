Truesilver		KEY:Truesilver		TYPE:Weapon.Ammunition	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	PRETYPE:1,Enhancement						SPROP:This ability incorporates magically purified and hardened silver into the weapon. It is treated as a silver weapon for the purpose of harming creatures particularly vulnerable to silver, such as ghosts. Furthermore, a truesilver weapon allows sneak attacks or critical hits on ghosts. Even though it is a change to the composition of the weapon rather than simply a magical property, truesilver can be added to an existing weapon.


# Merciful: The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all the damage it deals is subdual damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until commanded to resume it. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this property bestow the merciful effect on their ammunition.
# Screaming: Upon command, a screaming weapon emits a low hum that is grating on the ears but does not harm the wielder. Screaming weapons that hit produce a louder high-pitched sound and deal an extra 1d6 points of sonic damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this property bestow the sonic energy upon their ammunition. Screaming weapons deal this extra damage even within the area of a silence spell. Screaming weapons do not have any additional adverse affects upon creatures that use enhanced hearing, although such creatures dislike screaming weapons.
# Vampiric: Any living opponent struck by a vampiric weapon must make a Fortitude save (DC 16) or lose an additional 1d4 hit points, which are immediately added to the wielder's current hit point total. Any hit points above the wielder's maximum are treated as temporary hit points (multiple additions of temporary hit points don't stack) and disappear after 1 hour.
# Venomous: Once per day, a venomous weapon can inflict a poison spell (DC 14) upon a creature struck by the weapon (or projectile). The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be used in the same round that the weapon (or projectile) strikes.
