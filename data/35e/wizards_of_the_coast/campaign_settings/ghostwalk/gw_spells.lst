DESC:You make one undead-including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment-look different. You can make it seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change the creature's body type. For example, a wight could look human, humanoid, or like any other generally human-shaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature, such as a mole or a beard, or make it look like an entirely different creature. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. It does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the undead or its equipment. A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe. Note: Creatures get Will saves to recognize the glamer as an illusion if they interact with it (such as by touching the undead and having that sensory input not match what they see, in the case of this spell). Focus: A cocoon of a death's head moth.

DESC:You shroud yourself with invisible negative energy so that nonintelligent undead perceive you as a fellow undead creature, ignoring you. Your appearance does not change, and while intelligent undead do not immediately recognize you as alive, they are likely to question whether you are actually undead. If used in conjunction with a disguise or an illusion to appear undead, this spell gives you a +5 bonus on your Disguise check. If you attack an undead creature while this spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends. When using this spell, inflict spells heal you and cure spells hurt you. You are treated as if you were undead for the purpose of all spells and effects. A successful turn (or rebuke) attempt against an undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be panicked (or cowering) for 10 rounds. A turn attempt that would destroy (or command) undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will save (DC 15 + cleric's Charisma modifier) or be stunned (or charmed as with charm monster) for 10 rounds. Material Component: Dust or bone fragments from any destroyed undead creature.

DESC:You cause the skeleton of the target corporeal undead to become thicker and as strong as stone. This gives the target a +3 natural armor bonus to AC. It has no effect if the creature has no skeleton (such as an undead plant or octopus) but works normally on creatures that have exoskeletons (such as insects). Another version of this spell is rumored to exist that works on living creatures, but causes wracking pains because of the radical alteration of its skeleton. The other version has fallen out of use because few creatures willingly subject themselves to it (except perhaps worshipers of Loviatar). Arcane Focus: A miniature skull carved of granite.

You can protect yourself against only a natural occurrence or condition, not against a spell or the action of a creature (such as the breath of a dragon or the swords of a group of bandits). You must specify the condition against which you wish to protect yourself, and the spell is effective against only that condition. Should you be subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell, you feel no discomfort and take no damage from the condition. However, the spell does not protect any items carried on your person. At the end of the spell's duration, the condition has full normal effects on you if you are still subjected to it. Material Components: An ointment of peach syrup and cinnabar.

DESC:You give a weapon the undead bane property in addition to any other properties it has. Against undead, your weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) is +2 higher than normal and it deals +2d6 points of bonus damage against undead. The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the undead bane property. At caster level 9 (paladin level 18) and above, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not already a magic weapon. Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together, such as in the same quiver. Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their transmutation after they have been fired. The weapon is considered blessed, which means it has special effects on certain creatures. Any weapon affected by this spell glows with a serene gray radiance that sheds as much light as a candle.

DESC:You cause a corporeal undead to give off cold blue energy that disrupts the life force of living creatures but has no effect on objects or undead. The target creature does an additional 2d4 points of damage with its melee attacks. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the creature attacks it. If it succeeds, the creature is unaffected by that casting of the undead torch. If the undead creature is destroyed, the undead torch continues to burn at the location of its destruction until the duration ends, and creatures that come in contact with the remains take damage. If the undead creature assumes an incorporeal state (such as a vampire assuming gaseous form), the spell disperses harmlessly. Material Component: A living or dead firefly or glowworm.

DESC:You must be using your deity's favored weapon to cast this spell. You may use the weapon as if you had proficiency with it even if you normally do not. The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and an additional special ability (see the list below). A double weapon gains this enhancement bonus and special ability for only one of its two heads, as chosen by the caster. If your deity's weapon is "unarmed strike," your hand is treated as if under the effects of a magic fang (or greater magic fang, as appropriate) spell, that hand is considered armed, the special ability functions normally, and you can touch creatures without invoking the special ability if you desire. When your caster level reaches 9th, the enhancement bonus of the weapon increases to +2. At 12th level, the bonus rises to +3, at 15th level it is +4, and at 18th level it is +5.

# Spell Name				Description
Anti-Ectoplasm Shell.MOD		DESC:As antilife shell, except that it affects only ectoplasm, whether inert or part of an ectoplasmic creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Black Lungs.MOD				DESC:You cause the target to succumb to an infection and corruption of the lungs. An affected creature's speed is reduced by half, it loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls. Remove disease may end the effects of this spell early. This spell was created by the clerics of Khostren.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blessing of the Snake Mother.MOD	DESC:This spell causes the target to assume some of the qualities of the yuan-ti tainted one template, which provides several benefits. First, the target gains the Alertness feat. Second, the target's Constitution score increases by 2. Third, the target becomes completely immune to snake venom and yuan-ti poison. The target assumes a more feral and snakelike appearance (slitted pupils, elongated teeth, and so on) and is considered a yuan-ti for the purposes of all spells and effects (such as being subject to a ranger's favored enemy bonus against yuan-ti, not being able to form a ghost if slain, and so on). This spell was created by the yuan-ti to temporarily bolster their ranks with followers in a short period of time. Most other clerics would never consider casting this spell. The spell is normally used on willing victims, since it grants the caster no control over the target. Material Component: A few drops of the mixture that yuan-ti use to create tainted ones, which the target of the spell must swallow.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bonerattle.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a deep resonating vibration that damages bone. It does not affect creatures that do not have true bones (such as elementals, incorporeal creatures, most golems, oozes, plants, or purely ectoplasmic creatures) or that are under the effect of spells that alter their bones (such as stone bones, or a polymorph spell to turn into a boneless creature), but does affect creatures with exoskeletons instead of humanlike bones (such as vermin). The spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d4). Arcane Material Component: A tiny bell carved from a bone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bottomless Hate.MOD			DESC:You fill yourself with a terrible hatred against your favored enemies. Against them you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls for every three caster levels. This spell is suppressed by spells such as calm emotions.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Charm Person or Ghost.MOD		DESC:As charm person, except that it also affects ghosts.
Contingent Spell Lock.MOD		DESC:You transfer some of your currently prepared spells or available spell slots to a hidden part of your soul so that, if you die, when you appear on the Ethereal Plane, you have those spells or spell slots available for use (normally, dying and appearing on the Ethereal Plane causes you to lose all prepared spells and unused spell slots). You can transfer one spell per spell level that you can cast into this hidden part of your soul. Once you transfer the spells or spell slots in this manner, you cannot access them in any way-it is as if you had used those spell slots. The next time you choose to ready or prepare spells, you may leave those transferred spells or slots in place, or you may recover them along with your other spells or spell slots (which means they would not be available if you died). The transferred spells or spell slots may be used by your ghost in the normal manner, requiring the appropriate components and so on. If you are raised from the dead, the transferred spells become inaccessible again (although you can choose to recover them the next time you ready or prepare spells, as described above).
Create Ectoplasm.MOD			DESC:You create raw ectoplasm. The ectoplasm forms from your hands, eyes, or mouth, and may be pale gray, light blue, light green, or pale yellow. You may create sticky or slippery ectoplasm. The ectoplasm does not vanish until the spell duration has expired, but if the spell is dispelled and the ectoplasm has been in existence for more than 10 minutes, it vanishes instantly.
Death Lock.MOD				DESC:If the subject creature dies while the spell is in effect, its soul immediately passes on to the True Afterlife and cannot form a ghost. The subject can still be raised from the dead or even brought back as a ghost by magic (such as with the raise ghost spell); this spell only prevents a newly slain creature from forming a ghost of its own volition.
Delay Manifestation.MOD			DESC:You prevent the subject creature from manifesting as a ghost for the duration of the spell. If the subject dies, it appears on the Ethereal Plane as normal, but cannot enter the Material Plane while the spell is in effect. This spell works only on an ethereal ghost or a living creature with a physical body; it cannot be cast upon the body of someone who is already dead, because this spell affects a creature's soul and a dead body has no soul to affect.
Detect Ghost.MOD				DESC:You detect ghosts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.	DESC:&nl;1st Round: Presence or absence of ghosts.	DESC:&nl;2nd Round: Number of different ghosts.	DESC:&nl;3rd Round: The location of each ghost.
Dispel Possession.MOD			DESC:You force a being that is possessing a creature out of its host body. The possessor acts as if it had left its host voluntarily (a ghost appears next to the host, a person using magic jar returns to its receptacle if in range or dies if it is not, and so on). Alternatively, this spell may be used as a form of dispel magic to dispel a charm, dominate, or similar effect on a target. Material Component: powered silver worth 1 gp.
Disrupt Ectoplasm.MOD			DESC:You direct a ray of energy that damages ectoplasm. You must make a ranged touch attack roll to hit, and if the ray hits a ghost or object made of ectoplasm, it deals 1d6 points of damage to it. This damage bypasses the hardness of ectoplasmic objects and the damage reduction of ectoplasmic creatures.
Dominate Person or Ghost.MOD		DESC:As dominate person, except that it also affects ghosts.
Ecotplasmic Decay.MOD			DESC:You create a barely visible spread of energy that is harmful to ectoplasm but harmless to everything else. All ectoplasmic creatures and objects in the area take 1d6 points of damage per caster level. Material Component: A flat, sharpened disk made of resin.
Ectoplasmic Web.MOD			DESC:As web, except as noted below and that the strands are made of ectoplasm and therefore affect incorporeal creatures. Material Component: A bit of spider web and splinters from a sphere made of resin.
Ethereal Alarm.MOD			DESC:As alarm, but detecting only ethereal creatures that enter the warded area. The spell does not give you the ability to see the ethereal creatures once the alarm is triggered.
Forced Incorporeality.MOD		DESC:The target ghost is enveloped in an orange haze that forces it to be incorporeal for the duration of the spell. Forced incorporeality counters and dispels forced manifestation.
Forced Manifestation.MOD		DESC:The target creature is enveloped in a violet haze that forces it to manifest fully for the duration of the spell. Forced manifestation counters and dispels forced incorporeality.
Ghost Bane Weapon.MOD			DESC:You give a weapon the ghost bane property in addition to any other properties it has. Against ghosts, your weapon's enhancement bonus (if any) is 2 higher than normal and it deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the ghost bane property. At caster level 9th and higher, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not already a magic weapon. Alternatively, you can affect up to 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same type, and they have to be together, such as in the same quiver. Projectiles (but not thrown weapons) lose their ghost bane property when fired. Any weapon affected by this spell glows with witchlight (see the Witchlight feat).
Ghost Companion.MOD			DESC:The touched creature dies painlessly. Instead of passing immediately beyond the Veil of Souls, the creature's soul remains on the Ethereal Plane and attempts to enter the Material Plane as a ghost. Normally, this is used by ghost characters with a special nonhumanoid companion (such as a mage's familiar, a druid or ranger's animal companion, or a paladin's special mount) to allow the companion to travel with them in ghost form. When the spell expires, the ghost creature dies the true death and its soul passes beyond the Veil of Souls. It can be raised or resurrected before the spell duration expires, of course.
Ghost Lock.MOD				DESC:If the nonhumanoid subject creature dies while this spell is in effect, the creature's soul does not immediately enter the realm of the dead, and it can instead attempt to enter the Material Plane as a ghost, just as if it were a type of creature (humanoid) normally capable of such. Once the creature becomes a ghost, it can remain so until the spell duration expires, at which time it immediately passes through the Veil of Souls to the True Afterlife. The creature may willingly do this before the duration expires.
Ghost Touch Armor.MOD			DESC:The subject's armor gains the ghost touch property. Material Component: A shield made of resin.
Ghost Venom.MOD				DESC:As poison, except the poison affects only ghosts and other ectoplasmic creatures.
Glyph of Turning.MOD			DESC:As glyph of warding, except that instead of a spell effect or a blast of energy, the spell unleashes a burst of positive or negative energy, depending on whether you channel positive or negative energy. When you cast this spell, it uses one of your turning attempts for the day. If you have a feat or special ability that alters your turning check (such as Empower Turning), you may apply that modifier to the turning or rebuking stored in the glyph. When the glyph is triggered, the turning or rebuking attempt functions as if you were making the turning roll. A successful turning or rebuking attempt causes the undead to flee the glyph. If the result is that the undead are commanded, they guard the area of the glyph for 24 hours and then are released from the effects of the command. The commanded undead do not serve you.
Hail of Ectoplasm.MOD			DESC:An explosion of spheres of hardened ectoplasm occurs from a point you designate. The spheres deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to creatures within the effect. The ectoplasm decays into nothingness after the spell takes effect. Material Component: A handful of resin marbles.
Hold Person or Ghost.MOD		DESC:As hold person, except that it also affects ghosts.
Incorporeal Disharmonics.MOD		DESC:You create a wave of sonic energy that is harmful to incorporeal creatures. The target creature cannot avoid the damage with its incorporeal miss chance and takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per two caster levels. All creatures in adjacent squares take 1 point of sonic damage from the residual effects of the energy wave. Focus: A silver tuning fork.
I Smell Your Fear.MOD			DESC:As locate creature, except as noted above and below. Material Component: A sample of the target's flesh, blood, hair, ectoplasm, or some other physical part.
Irresistible Force.MOD			DESC:Charging yourself with divine energy, you become the epitome of force in motion. You are protected by freedom of movement. You may charge as long as you move at least 5 feet. You may pass through enemy squares as if they were occupied by allies. You gain a +10 bonus on bull rush attempts. You gain a +10 bonus on checks made to avoid being tripped. If you are pinned, you can still move 5 feet as part of your turn, as long as you are strong enough to move the person pinning you. When moving in combat, you act as if you had the Mobility feat.
Painless Death.MOD			DESC:The touched creature dies painlessly and instantly.
Persuade to Manifest.MOD		DESC:This spell sends a powerful signal to the soul of a creature that has died and not yet manifested on the Material Plane or passed on to the True Afterlife. The soul immediately appears on the Ethereal Plane and can immediately make a Wisdom check with a +10 morale bonus to manifest on the Material Plane. If that check is failed, the ghost may make Wisdom checks normally every minute to manifest.
Pleasant Visage.MOD			DESC:You disguise the wounds of a ghost who has a disturbing, repulsive, or gruesome appearance, making it appear completely normal (although still a ghost). The spell does not change the ghost's features or disguise it in any way; it conceals the manner of the ghost's death so that it can walk about in polite society.
Preserve Ectoplasm.MOD			DESC:As purify food and drink, but affecting only ectoplasm. Material Component: A small loop of gold wire.
Proper State.MOD				DESC:You transform a willing incorporeal undead creature into a ghost. If its previous class and level are unknown, it becomes a ghost of the same race as you, with warrior levels equal to its undead Hit Dice. If the undead's previous race, class, and level were known (such as if the undead were a former ally that became the spawn of a shadow), it becomes a ghost of its former self. In any case, the creature's character level is no greater than the Hit Dice it had as an undead. For example, a 5th-level dwarf fighter that became a shadow's spawn and was turned into a ghost with this spell would now be a 2nd-level fighter. Levels lost in this manner are handled as if the character had lost levels from an undead's energy drain attack. A creature redeemed with this spell retains the alignment it had as an undead creature, although it is not strongly attached to that alignment and can change it over time or with the aid of an atonement spell. Because only humanoids can become ghosts, this spell works only on incorporeal undead that are vaguely humanoid. For example, it cannot convert a spectral steed (a horselike undead), a nightwing nightshade (a batlike creature), a nightwalker nightshade (a giantlike creature), or a nightcrawler (a wormlike creature) into a ghost.
Protection from Possession.MOD	DESC:This spell wards a creature against mental control and possession attempts. The spell blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (as by a magic jar attack or certain ghost feats) or to exercise mental control over the creature (as by a vampire's supernatural domination ability, which works similarly to dominate person). The protection does not prevent a vampire's domination itself, but it prevents the vampire from mentally commanding the protected creature. If the protection from possession effect ends before the domination effect does, the vampire would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the spell keeps out a possessing life force, but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. Arcane Material Component: A bit of powdered silver, which is used to mark the forehead of the target creature.
Raise Ghost.MOD				DESC:As raise dead, except that this spell can bring back only a ghost who has been killed. It does not restore life to a dead body, but instead brings back a slain ghost as a ghost. The spell requires some of the ghost's original ectoplasm (some of the ghost's ectoplasm that has been preserved with magic or alchemy is sufficient). Alternatively, you may cast it on a dead creature's body to bring it back as a ghost. The creature's soul is aware that it will return as a ghost instead of a living creature and can refuse to accept the spell if it does not want this to happen. This form of the spell works only on creatures that can become ghosts. As with other forms of this magic, if cast within the Manifest Ward, a raised ghost does not lose a level or a Constitution point when brought back from the dead.
Repel Ectoplasm.MOD			DESC:As repel wood, but affecting only ectoplasm, whether inert or part of an ectoplasmic creature. Large manifestations of ectoplasm (such as a wall of ectoplasm spell) are not considered "fixed firmly" for the purpose of this spell and are pushed back by the waves of energy.
Sherem Transformation.MOD		DESC:You enhance the abilities of an unborn human child, giving the child exceptional sorcerous ability (if female) or exceptional clarity of mind (if male). Upon reaching adulthood, the child may select the Kihu- Sherem Guardian or Sherem-Lar Sorcery feats. While the spell affects an unborn child, it is targeted at the pregnant mother, who may resist the spell with a Will saving throw. If the mother is bearing multiple children, the spell randomly affects one of the unborn (in these cases, the spell is usually cast multiple times in order to affect all of them). If the mother is from an unbroken line of sherem-lar sorcerers at least ten generations long, a female child born of this spell may choose the Sherezem-Lar Sorcery feat. This spell is normally used on only Bazareene nobles, and most nobles consider it a crime to use the spell on anyone but a noble. Conversely, most people outside of Bazareene consider magically altering an unborn child to be a repugnant act and would never allow it. Focus: A flawless emerald worth at least 1,000 gp. Material Components: Blood from a Bazareene sorcerer of at least 6th level, an iron ring that has touched lava, and three golden spheres worth 50 gp each.
Song of the Calling.MOD			DESC:You force a ghost to succumb to the Calling and depart immediately for the True Afterlife. Each level in the eidolon class the target ghost has gives it a -1 penalty on its saving throw against this spell.
Spittle Spray.MOD				DESC:You can spit out to close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). If you have a poison bite attack, this spell allows you to spit your poison out to this range. You make a ranged touch attack to hit your foe, and if you succeed, the target must make a saving throw against your poison as if it had been bitten. This spell is normally used by the yuan-ti and has no significant effect if used with normal spittle.
Unmovable Object.MOD			DESC:Charging yourself with divine energy, you bond yourself to the ground beneath your feet and become the epitome of stability. The spell ends instantly if you move from your current position and does not work unless you are in contact with the ground. You gain a +2 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. You gain a +10 bonus to resist a bull rush (this bonus does not include the +4 bonus for being "exceptionally stable," but exceptionally stable creatures do get that bonus in addition to the bonus from this spell). You gain a +10 bonus to resist all trip attacks (but not to your attempts to trip someone in return). You gain a +10 resistance bonus on any roll made to resist an effect that would cause you to move from your current location. For example, while you are not immune to enchantment effects, you gain a +10 resistance bonus on saving throws (or Charisma checks, in the case of effects such as charm person) to resist commands that would cause you to leave your current position. If the ground you stand on disappears or cannot support your weight (such as with disintegrate or transmute rock to mud), this spell ends and the existing conditions affect you normally.
Wall of Ectoplasm.MOD			DESC:This spell creates an anchored plane of ectoplasm or a hemisphere of ectoplasm, depending upon the version selected. A wall of ectoplasm cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ectoplasm is semisolid (not raw)-about the consistency of packed snow-and retains its shape rather than collapsing into a formless mass. Because ectoplasm is a ghost touch material, it is an impenetrable barrier to incorporeal creatures (although they may attack the wall or go around it). The ectoplasm is opaque and blocks line of effect. Ectoplasm Plane: A sheet of ectoplasm appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level and covers up to a 10-foot-square per caster level (so a 6th-level wizard could create a wall of ectoplasm 30 feet long and 20 feet high, a wall 60 feet long and 10 feet high, and so on). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need be anchored only on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides. The wall is primarily defensive in nature and is used to stop pursuers from following you and the like. Each 10-foot square of wall has hardness 0 and 2 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall without making an attack roll. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. A creature can break through the wall with a Strength check (DC 12 + caster level). Hemisphere: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet +1 foot per caster level. Thus, a 7th-level caster can create a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. It is as hard to break through as the ectoplasm plane variation. You can create the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though these creatures get a Reflex saving throw to avoid being trapped. Material Component: A cube of resin and a drop of oil.
Summon Undead I.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I (PH 285), except that you summon an undead creature. Summon undead I conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list in the accompanying sidebar. You choose which creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. Summoned undead do not count toward the total Hit Dice of undead that you can control with animate dead or the other command undead abilities. No undead creature you summon can have more Hit Dice than your caster level +1. Focus: A tiny bag, a small (not lit) candle, and a carved bone from any humanoid.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Undead II.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that you can summon one undead from the 2nd-level list or two undead of the same kind from the 1st-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Undead III.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that you can summon one undead from the 2nd-level list or two undead of the same kind from the 1st-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Undead IV.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that you can summon one undead from the 4th-level list, two undead of the same kind from the 3rd-level list, or four undead of the same kind from a lower-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Undead V.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that you can summon one undead from the 5th-level list, two undead of the same kind from the 4thlevel list, or four undead of the same kind from a lower-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
