Hengeyokai Racial Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:-2 Wisdom. Hengeyokai tend to be flighty and weak-willed. A hengeyokai's physical ability scores vary widely in its animal and hybrid forms; the character's generated ability scores apply to its human form. In hybrid form, a hengeyokai gains a +2 adjustment to one physical ability score, as shown on Table 1-2: Hengeyokai Hybrid Forms. Its physical ability scores in animal form are average for its animal type, as shown on Table 1-3: Hengeyokai Animal Forms (page 12).	DESC:&nl;Alternate Form: Hengeyokai can change shape, assuming one of three possible forms. This supernatural ability functions like the polymorph other spell, but a hengeyokai can change form a number of times per day equal to 1 plus his character level. Thus, a 1st-level hengeyokai can switch from human form to animal form and back again in a single day. Changing form is a full-round action that does provoke attacks of opportunity, as with the polymorph self spell. A hengeyokai's animal form is a normal animal of Small or smaller size. Possible animal forms include badger, carp, cat, crab, crane, dog, fox, hare, monkey, raccoon dog, rat, sparrow, and weasel. Equipment the hengeyokai is wearing or carrying transforms to become part of the animal form (as with polymorph other), and magic items cease functioning while the hengeyokai remains in animal form. In animal form, the hengeyokai has low-light vision and the supernatural ability to communicate with other animals of its kind. This is the same as a familiar's ability to speak with animals of its type. Hengeyokai have the size, speed, AC, damage rating, and physical ability scores shown on Table 1-3: Hengeyokai Animal Forms. In animal form, a hengeyokai is effectively disguised as an animal, gaining a +10 bonus on Disguise checks while in this form. Hengeyokai in hybrid form retain their low-light vision and the ability to communicate with animals of their type. Their physical characteristics are based on their abilities in human form, modified as shown on Table 1-2: Hengeyokai Hybrid Forms. In this form, a hengeyokai can typically wear light or medium armor without modification, but wearing heavy armor is impossible. Equipment worn or carried by a hengeyokai in human form does not transform when the hengeyokai assumes hybrid form. When a hengeyokai in animal form assumes hybrid form, her equipment returns to its normal form and magic items resume functioning.	DESC:&nl;Shapechanger: Hengeyokai are shapechangers, not humanoids. As such, they are immune to spells that specifically target humanoids (including charm person and hold person), but are susceptible to any spells that target shapechangers.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Samurai ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Samurai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Samurai are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor. Samurai are not proficient with shields. Note that armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Pick Pocket, and Tumble. Also, Swim checks suffer a -1 penalty for every 5 pounds of armor and equipment carried.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Ancestral Daisho					KEY:Samurai ~ Ancestral Daisho				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Samurai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:All samurai begin play with a katana and a wakizashi-two masterwork weapons. These are weapons that belonged to the samurai's ancestors, and protecting the weapons is an important point of honor for the samurai. As a samurai acquires treasure through adventuring, he has the option of awakening the supernatural abilities latent in the weapons. This option allows a samurai who prefers to use his ancestral blade to wield a magic weapon, while a samurai who wields a tetsubo against Shadowlands fiends can use his treasure to acquire new jade or magic weapons. At any time, a samurai may retreat to a temple or shrine and spend time in prayer in order to awaken the ancestral spirits in his katana or wakizashi. (Most samurai improve their katanas and not their wakizashis.) This requires a sacrifice of valuable items worth the amount shown on Table 2-2: Ancestral Daisho. This sacrifice does not have to be gold-the character can sacrifice magic items or other goods worth the required amount, rather than selling his goods (at half value) to pay for the sacrifice. The samurai must meet the minimum character level (including any prestige class levels) shown on the table, and he must spend one day per 1,000 gp sacrificed in the shrine or temple. During this time, he must spend at least 8 hours each day kneeling before his ancestors and his weapons, not stopping to eat or rest. Many samurai request the assistance of a shugenja in this process, but a shugenja is not required. The values shown on Table 2-2 are the total value of sacrifice required to bring a single weapon to the listed weapon bonus. If a samurai already has a +3 katana, he can raise it to a +4 katana by sacrificing 14,000 gp and spending two weeks in prayer. If the same samurai wanted to bring his masterwork wakizashi to a +1 wakizashi, he would have to sacrifice 2,000 gp. Before a samurai's ancestral sword becomes a +1 weapon, it is an ordinary masterwork weapon in every way. Its latent supernatural powers do not cause it to be considered a magic weapon until those powers are awakened. A samurai who loses his ancestral swords is dishonored until he can recover them. He cannot enhance any other weapon in this way. Note: In some campaigns, a samurai might begin play with a different ancestral weapon, such as a tulwar (scimitar) or a jian (longsword).																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.21	DESC:&nl;At 4th level, the weapon is considered honorable for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.

Additionally, the samurai code of bushido requires that he be obedient to his lord, accept death at any time and face it bravely, avenge any dishonor, and shun any appearance of cowardice. The core principles of bushido are honor, loyalty, and courage. Violating these precepts results in dishonor, which may result in a samurai being stripped of his family name or being asked to commit seppuku (ritual suicide).

# Shaman
Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Shaman ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Shamans are proficient with all simple weapons and with light armor. Note that armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Pick Pocket, and Tumble. Also, Swim checks suffer a -1 penalty for every 5 pounds of armor and equipment carried.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Spells						KEY:Shaman ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:A shaman casts divine spells according to Table 2-3: The Shaman. A shaman may prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list (see Chapter 7: Magic and Spells), provided he can cast spells of that level. (Alignment restrictions mean that casting some spells may have unpleasant consequences.) The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a shaman's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the shaman's Wisdom modifier. Shamans do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as gifts from the many spirits (nature spirits, animal spirits, ancestor spirits, and others) with whom the shaman deals. Each shaman must choose a time at which he must spend an hour each day in quiet conversation with the spirits to regain his daily allotment of spells (typically, this hour is at dawn or noon for good shamans and at dusk or midnight for evil ones). Time spent resting has no effect on whether a shaman can prepare spells. In addition to his standard spells, a shaman gets one domain spell of each spell level, starting at 1st. When a shaman prepares a domain spell, it must come from one of his two domains (see below for details).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Spirits, Domains, and Domain Spells		KEY:Shaman ~ Spirits Domains and Domain Spells	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Choose two domains for your shaman. Each domain represents an individual spirit with which you have a special relationship-a spirit of the dead (usually one of your ancestors), an animal spirit, or a nature spirit. Each spirit gives you access to a domain spell at each spell level, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. Your shaman gets the granted powers of both domains you select. With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a shaman prepares one or the other each day. If a domain spell is not on the Shaman Spells list, a shaman can only prepare it in his domain slot. Domain spells and granted powers are given in Shaman Domains (see Chapter 7). When a shaman reaches 11th level, he can choose a third domain, and gains access to the spells and granted power of this domain. Each day, he can prepare two domain spells of certain spell levels, as shown on Table 2-3.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Spontaneous Casting				KEY:Shaman ~ Spontaneous Casting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Good shamans can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that they haven't prepared ahead of time. The shaman can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name). For example, a good shaman who has prepared bless (a 1st-level spell) may lose bless in order to cast cure light wounds (also a 1st-level spell). Good shamans can cast cure spells in this way because they are especially proficient at wielding positive energy. An evil shaman, on the other hand, can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with "inflict" in the title). Such shamans are especially proficient at wielding negative energy. A neutral shaman can convert spells either to cure spells or to inflict spells (player's choice), depending on whether the shaman is more proficient at wielding positive or negative energy. Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the neutral shaman turns or rebukes undead (see below). A shaman can't use spontaneous casting to convert domain spells into cure or inflict spells. These spells arise from the particular powers of the shaman's chosen spirits, not divine energy in general.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells	KEY:Shaman ~ Alignment Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:A shaman can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own. A good shaman cannot cast evil spells, and vice versa. Spells associated with the alignments of chaos, evil, good, and law are identified as such on the "School, Subschool and Descriptors" line of the spell description.

Animal Companion					KEY:Shaman ~ Animal Companion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:A 1st-level shaman may begin play with an animal companion. This animal is one that the shaman has befriended with the spell animal friendship. It can have up to 2 Hit Dice. (While the shaman is 1st level, this particular animal is loyal enough to stay with him, even though an adventuring shaman usually can only maintain animal friends whose Hit Dice total up to his level.) Alternatively, the shaman may have more than one animal companion provided the animals' total Hit Dice don't exceed 2. The shaman can also cast animal friendship in play (see the spell description in the Player's Handbook).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Spirit Sight					KEY:Shaman ~ Spirit Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:A shaman of 2nd level and above can see ethereal creatures (including spirits) as easily as he sees material creatures and objects. The shaman can easily distinguish between ethereal creatures and material ones, because ethereal creatures appear translucent and indistinct.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Turn or Rebuke Undead				KEY:Shaman ~ Turn or Rebuke Undead			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:When a shaman reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to turn or rebuke undead. He may use this ability a number of times per day equal to three plus his Charisma modifier. He turns undead as a cleric of two levels lower would. Neutral shamans must choose to either turn or rebuke undead (see Spontaneous Casting above).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Extra Turning					KEY:Shaman ~ Extra Turning				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:As a feat, a shaman may take Extra Turning. This feat allows the shaman to turn undead four more times per day than normal. A shaman can take this feat multiple times, gaining four extra daily turning attempts each time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Bonus Feat						KEY:Shaman ~ Bonus Feat					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shaman Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a shaman gains a bonus martial arts feat. The shaman must choose these feats from the following list: Defensive Throw, Deflect Arrows (Grappling Block), Dodge, Expertise (Karmic Strike, Improved Trip, Defensive Strike, Superior Expertise), Great Throw, Improved Grapple (Choke Hold, Earth's Embrace), Stunning Fist (Falling Star Strike, Freezing the Lifeblood, Unbalancing Strike, Pain Touch).

They are not proficient with any type of armor, nor with shields. It is considered inappropriate for a shugenja to wear armor, and many samurai consider it an insult to their station to have a nonsamurai wearing the armor that they believe is a badge of their rank. Likewise, while a shugenja is entitled to wear the wakizashi as a member of the noble class, wearing a katana is considered an indication that the wearer is prepared to use it in defense, and most shugenjas would rather leave the swordplay to the samurai. Note that armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Pick Pocket, and Tumble. Also, Swim checks suffer a -1 penalty for every 5 pounds of armor and equipment carried.

Spells						KEY:Shugenja ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shugenja Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:A shugenja casts divine spells, but her spell knowledge is limited, much like that of a sorcerer. Your shugenja begins play knowing four 0-level spells (also called inori) and two 1st-level spells of your choice, plus one 0-level spell and one 1st-level spell that are determined by your school. At each level, the shugenja gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2-5: Shugenja Spells Known. One spell of every level is determined by the shugenja's school; sometimes these spells are normal spells on the shugenja spell list, but often they are additions to the spell list. These spells are listed with the shugenja spell list in Chapter 7: Magic and Spells. (Note: The number of spells a shugenja knows is not affected by her Charisma bonus, if any; the numbers on Table 2-5 are fixed.) A shugenja is limited to casting a certain number of spells of each level per day, but she need not prepare her spells in advance. The number of spells she can cast per day is improved by her bonus spells, if any. For instance, at 1st level, Kitsu Mari can cast four 1st-level spells per day-three for being 1st level (see Table 2-4: The Shugenja), plus one thanks to her high Charisma. However, she only knows three 1st-level spells: cure light wounds (her school spell of that level), bless, and burning hands (see Table 2-5: Shugenja Spells Known). In any given day, she can cast cure light wounds four times, cast bless four times, cast burning hands four times, or cast some combination of the three spells a total of four times. She does not have to decide ahead of time which spells she'll cast. A shugenja may use a higher-level slot to cast a lower-level spell if she so chooses. For example, if an 8th-level shugenja has used up all her 3rd-level spell slots for the day but wants to cast another one, she could use a 4th-level slot to do so. The spell is still treated as its actual level, not the level of the slot used to cast it. To learn or cast a spell, a shugenja must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against shugenja spells is 10 + the spell's level + the shugenja's Charisma modifier. Shugenjas do not have spellbooks, though they write their spells on ofudas. These ofudas serve as divine focus items and must be read as part of the spellcasting process. Shugenjas can use the Scribe Scroll feat to create magic scrolls that work the same as a wizard's or cleric's scrolls. When casting metamagic spells, remember that the shugenja has not prepared the spell in advance, and is doing so on the spot. The shugenja, therefore, must take more time to cast a metamagic spell than a regular spell. If its normal casting time is 1 action, casting a metamagic spell is a fullround action for a shugenja. For spells with a longer casting time, it takes an extra fullround action to cast the spell. Shugenjas cannot use the Quicken Spell metamagic feat.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Element Focus					KEY:Shugenja ~ Element Focus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shugenja Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:All shugenjas have a favored element: air, earth, fire, or water. A shugenja's choice of specialized element is determined by the clan schools in which she studies. At least half the spells a shugenja knows at each spell level must belong to her favored element, and the spell dictated by her school also belongs to that element. This is reflected on Table 2-5, which indicates how many spells of each level must be spells of the shugenja's favored element. At 1st level, for example, the shugenja Kitsu Mari must know at least three 0-level water spells-one water spell determined by her school and two additional water spells, plus two other 0-level spells of any element. She also knows one 1st-level water spell from her school, one additional 1st-level water spell, and one 1st-level spell of any element. Shugenjas automatically gain the benefits of the Spell Focus feat for spells from their favored element. As the cost of specializing in one element, a shugenja is prohibited from learning spells associated with a different element. The prohibited element is dictated by the favored element, as described below.

Air							KEY:Shugenja ~ Air						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shugenja Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Air spells are subtle, involving travel, intuition, influence, divination, and illusion. Earth is the prohibited element for air shugenjas.

Earth							KEY:Shugenja ~ Earth						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shugenja Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Earth spells involve resilience and resolve, health and growth, the body and its strength.

Water is the prohibited element for fire shugenjas. The Agasha school of the Phoenix clan specializes in fire magic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Water							KEY:Shugenja ~ Water						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shugenja Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Water spells involve transformation, cleansing, healing, and friendship. Fire is the prohibited element for water shugenjas. The Kitsu school of the Lion clan and the Iuchi school of the Unicorn clan specialize in water magic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.26
#The shugenjas of the Phoenix clan's Isawa school can specialize in any of the four elements. The Isawa school also trains shugenjas who specialize in the fifth element, Void. See the Void disciple prestige class in Chapter 3: Prestige Classes.
Sense Elements					KEY:Shugenja ~ Sense Elements				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shugenja Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:One of the first "spells" a shugenja learns-a magical effect so basic that it becomes a spell-like ability-is the ability to sense elements. As a full-round action, a shugenja can become aware of all sources of one chosen element (air, earth, fire, or water) within 10 feet of herself. The shugenja learns the size of the objects but not their precise location or actual nature. By concentrating longer, a shugenja can either extend her magical senses or gather more information about the elements she has detected. Each additional round spent in concentration allows the shugenja to add 5 feet to the radius of her sense ability, to a maximum of 5 additional feet per shugenja level. Thus, at 4th level, Kitsu Mari can sense elements to a maximum range of 30 feet by concentrating for five full rounds. Alternatively, the shugenja can focus on one source of the sensed element per round, attempting a Spellcraft check to determine more about that single item. The amount of information she learns depends on her Spellcraft check result: (See Table). In subsequent rounds, a shugenja can either retry her Spellcraft check on the same item, shift her attention to a different item, or extend the range of her senses. A 1st-level shugenja can use this ability three times per day. Every five levels she advances as a shugenja allows her to use the ability an additional time per day (four times at 5th level, five times at 10th level, and so on). Like many divination spells, a shugenja's sense elements ability is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. For example, Kitsu Mari enters a room and concentrates to sense water. (Although she is a water shugenja, she could just as easily sense any other element, including fire.) She becomes aware of all sources of water within 10 feet. A basin of water rests on the nightstand, a person lurks behind the door (living creatures are made of all four elements) holding a vial of poison-Kitsu Mari discovers three sources of water within 10 feet of her: one Medium-size, one Small, and one Fine. Focusing on the Medium-size source and concentrating for a round, she makes a Spellcraft check and gets a result of 31. She learns that the Medium-size source of water is a creature, that it is natural, and where it is. If the assassin behind the door has not already jumped out to attack her, she has learned that a creature is hiding behind the door . . . but more likely, she has learned this too late.

Note that armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Pick Pocket, and Tumble. Also, Swim checks suffer a -1 penalty for every 5 pounds of armor and equipment carried.

SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Spells						KEY:Sohei ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Sohei Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a sohei gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the sohei must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a sohei with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Sohei bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a Difficulty Class of 10 + spell level + Wisdom modifier. When the sohei gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 4th level, the sohei gets only bonus spells. A sohei without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. The sohei's spell list appears in Chapter 7. A sohei has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare. A sohei prepares and casts spells just as a cleric or shaman does. Through 3rd level, a sohei has no caster level. Starting at 4th level, a sohei's caster level is one-half her class level.

Ki Frenzy						KEY:Sohei ~ Ki Frenzy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Sohei Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Starting at 1st level, a sohei gains the ability to focus her ki power into a frenzy of berserk energy. In this frenzied state, she temporarily gains +2 to Strength and +2 to Dexterity. Her speed increases by 10 feet, and she can choose to make a flurry of blows with a full attack action in melee, making one extra attack per round while suffering a -2 penalty on every attack. While in a ki frenzy, a sohei cannot use skills or abilities that require patience or concentration, such as moving silently or casting spells. (She cannot use any class skills in a frenzy.) She can use any feat she might have except for Expertise, item creation feats, metamagic feats, and Skill Focus (if it's tied to a skill that requires patience or concentration). A ki frenzy lasts for a number of rounds equal to three + the sohei's Constitution modifier. The sohei may prematurely end the frenzy voluntarily. At the end of the frenzy, the sohei is fatigued (-2 to Strength, -2 to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of that encounter. The sohei can only enter a frenzy once per encounter, and only a certain number of times per day (determined by level). Entering a frenzy takes no time itself, but the sohei can only do it during her action, not in response to somebody else's action.

If a sohei of at least 9th level makes a successful Will or Fortitude saving throw that would normally reduce the spell's effect, she suffers no effect from the spell at all. Only those spells with a Saving Throw entry of "Will partial," "Fortitude half," or similar entries can be negated through this ability.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Wu Jen ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wu Jen Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Wu jen are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor nor with shields. Armor of any type interferes with a wu jen's movements, which can cause her spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). Note that armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Pick Pocket, and Tumble. Also, Swim checks suffer a -1 penalty for every 5 pounds of armor and equipment carried.

Spells						KEY:Wu Jen ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wu Jen Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:A wu jen casts arcane spells. She is limited to a certain number of spells of each spell level per day, according to her class level. A wu jen must prepare spells ahead of time by getting a good night's sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wu jen decides which spells to prepare (see Preparing Wizard Spells in the Player's Handbook). To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a wu jen must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level. A wu jen's bonus spells are based on Intelligence. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against wu jen spells is 10 + the spell's level + the wu jen's Intelligence modifier.

Elemental Mastery					KEY:Wu Jen ~ Elemental Mastery				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wu Jen Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:The spells of a wu jen are divided into five elemental groups: earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. When a wu jen learns all the spells of a single element up to the highest level of spells she can cast, she is considered a master of that element. Thereafter, whenever the wu jen casts a spell of that element, the saving throw DC is increased by 2, while the wu jen herself gets a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against spells of that element. This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by the Spell Focus feat. Note that when the wu jen gains the ability to cast higher-level spells, she loses her mastery until she learns all the spells of that element at the new spell level. Certain spells on the wu jen spell list are designated "All"; this means they belong to all elemental groups, and a wu jen must learn these spells in order to achieve mastery of any element.

The spell's level does not change, and once the choice of spell and modification are chosen, they cannot be changed. As the wu jen goes up in level, she can choose the same spell to be modified in different ways with multiple spell secrets. She does not need to know the feat she applies to the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.31
Spellbooks						KEY:Wu Jen ~ Spellbooks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wu Jen Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Wu jen must study their spellbooks each day to prepare their spells, much like wizards. A wu jen cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook (except for read magic, which all wu jen can prepare from memory). A wu jen begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wu jen spells plus three 1st-level spells of the player's choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wu jen has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell. Each time the wu jen achieves a new level, she gains two new spells of any level or levels that she can cast (according to her new level). For example, when Hideyori achieves 5th level, she can add two 3rd-level spells to her spellbook.

Possible taboos include: . Cannot eat meat. . Cannot own more than she can carry. . Must make a daily offering (such as food, flowers, or incense) to one or many spirit powers. . Cannot bathe. . Cannot cut her hair. . Cannot touch a dead body. . Cannot drink alcohol. . Cannot wear a certain color. . Cannot light a fire. .
