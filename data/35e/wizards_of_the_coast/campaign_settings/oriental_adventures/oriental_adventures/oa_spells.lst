###Block: Spell Descriptions
# TODO: Review CLASSES and make sure Class listed isn't school/domain only.
# Spell Name				Description
Accuracy.MOD				DESC:Doubles weapon's range increment.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Accuracy.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you enchant one or more thrown weapons or one projectile weapon (bow, crossbow, sling, or the like) to improve the chance of hitting distant targets. For the duration of the spell, the range increment for the affected thrown weapons or single projectile weapon is doubled. Material Component: Ink, written in a mystical character on each weapon affected by the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Advice.MOD					DESC:Subject follows your advice, even if complex or self destructive.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Advice.MOD					DESC:You influence the actions of the targeted creature by offering profound and thoughtful advice grounded in your wisdom and experience. You must word your advice in such a manner as to make it sound reasonable, even if it is not, but you are not limited to a few sentences. If the target creature fails its saving throw, it does its best to follow your advice, carrying out the suggested course of action to the best of its ability. If the action would place the creature in great peril or cause its death, the victim can attempt a second saving throw-this time with a +4 circumstance bonus-just before taking the final plunge to its doom.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aiming at the Target.MOD		DESC:Cast while concentrating on another spell for +10 bonus on Concentration checks.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aiming at the Target.MOD		DESC:When you cast this spell, you increase your ability to concentrate on a spell you have already cast. This spell is one of only two spells that you can cast while maintaining concentration on another spell (the other being finding the center). This spell gives you a +10 circumstance bonus on Concentration checks you make to maintain concentration on another spell, and lasts as long as your concentration on the other spell. Casting aiming at the target is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ancestral Vengeance.MOD			DESC:Ancestral spirit deals 1d6/two levels damage (maximum 5d6), 1d6/level (maximum 10d6) to undead.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ancestral Vengeance.MOD			DESC:When you cast this spell, you call out to an ancestral spirit, listing the crimes of your target and urging your ancestor to punish the miscreant. (The target's alignment is irrelevant to the success of the spell.) The ancestral spirit imposes this punishment in the form of a sharp blow to the target. This attack hits automatically and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6), or 1d6 points per caster level (maximum 10d6) if the target is undead. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces the damage by half.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Fire.MOD				DESC:Turn a Small or smaller quantity of fire into an animated object.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Fire.MOD				DESC:As animate wood, but you can only animate a Small or smaller quantity of fire. Animated fire deals fire damage equal to its slam damage (with no Strength penalty), has the burn special attack of a fire elemental (save DC 11), and the fire subtype. Material Component: A handful of charcoal, sulfur, and soda ash.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Water.MOD				DESC:Turn a Small or smaller quantity of water into an animated object.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Water.MOD				DESC:As animate wood, but you can only animate a Small or smaller quantity of water. Material Component: A small vial of pure spring water mixed with cinnabar oil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Wood.MOD				DESC:As animate objects, but Small or smaller wooden object.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Wood.MOD				DESC:You imbue a Small or smaller object made of wood with mobility and a semblance of life. The animated wood then attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate. Statistics for animated objects are found in the Monster Manual. The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. Material Component: A mixture of powdered cinnabar and ground peach pit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Apparition.MOD				DESC:Subject's face looks terrifying; viewers may become shaken.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Apparition.MOD				DESC:This spell causes the subject's face to appear horrible and terrifying. You can create nearly any combination of hideous features-blue skin, parrot face, elephantine nose, rotting tusks, or anything else you can imagine. You can not duplicate the appearance of any known creature, however. Creatures-excluding you and your allies-who view the recipient must make successful Will saving throws or become shaken. Shaken creatures suffer a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws. Material Component: A miniature palette dotted with paints of assorted colors.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Attraction.MOD				DESC:Attacks are drawn to the subject creature, dealing more damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Attraction.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, a mystical aura surrounds the subject creature, drawing attacks to the creature and making successful attacks more effective. The subject takes an additional +1 point of damage per caster level (max +5) from each melee or ranged attack that deals damage to it. This spell does not increase damage from spells.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Backbiter.MOD				DESC:Large wooden-hafted weapon strikes wielder.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Backbiter.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you place an enchantment on a Large or larger wooden-hafted weapon (such as a bo, naginata, nunchaku, three-section staff, or similar weapon). The next time that weapon is used to make a melee attack, its shaft twists around so that the weapon strikes the wielder instead. The weapon's wielder makes a normal attack roll upon himself and deals normal damage if he hits. He cannot choose to deal subdual damage or otherwise reduce the damage he deals, although any damage reduction he has still applies. Once the attacker damages himself with the affected weapon, the spell is discharged. Unattended magic weapons targeted by this spell receive a Will save; if successful, the spell has no effect. See Attack an Object in the Player 's Handbook for information concerning object saving throws. Focus: A dagger.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blood of Fire.MOD				DESC:Four blood missiles deal 2d8 damage each.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blood of Fire.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you cut a mystic pattern into one palm with a knife and enchant your own blood. The spell creates one missile of blood per three caster levels (maximum of five missiles). You can then send these missiles of blood streaking from the upturned palm, which explode on impact. You can choose a separate target for each missile, but you must make a ranged touch attack for each missile. A direct hit deals 2d8 points of damage with no saving throw allowed. Creatures within 5 feet of a creature struck by a missile must make successful Reflex saves or take the same damage. (Missiles that miss their target do not cause damage to any creature.) Material Component: Your blood. Cutting the pattern in your palm deals 2 points of damage to you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bo of Water.MOD				DESC:Melee attack deals 1d8+1/two levels damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bo of Water.MOD				DESC:A 6-foot-long staff formed of water, which you can use with proficiency, springs forth from your hands. You wield this staff as if it were a quarterstaff. Attacks with the bo of water are regular melee attacks. The bo deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). The bo is considered a +1 weapon for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body Outside Body.MOD			DESC:Create one duplicate of yourself per 5 levels.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body Outside Body.MOD			DESC:This spell creates one or more duplicates of you. These duplicates share all your ability scores, personality, class levels, skills, feats, and memories. They carry the same arms, armor, and equipment as you do (but only have mundane versions of your magical gear), and they cannot cast spells. The duplicates you create have one-quarter of your hit point total at the time of casting. They are obedient to you and friendly toward one another and your companions. You may order them to take any actions, even ones that you would normally not take (such as charging the dragon or jumping off a cliff ). They can do anything you can, except cast spells or use spell-completion or spell-trigger items. They take damage as normal, but if one is slain, it disappears and you instantly take 10 points of damage. At the end of the spell duration, all the duplicates (and any equipment created with them) disappear without causing damage to you. The duplicates are completely indistinguishable from you. Material Component: A few hairs from your head or beard.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Castigate.MOD				DESC:Creatures of different alignment take 2d6 or 5d6 damage and are deafened for 1d4 rounds.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Castigate.MOD				DESC:By means of this spell, you deliver a blasting rebuke upon your foes. Creatures within the area are affected based on their alignment in relation to yours. Creatures whose alignment differs from yours in one component (lawful-neutralchaotic or good-neutral-evil) take 2d6 points of damage. Those whose alignment differs from yours in both components (both lawful-neutral-chaotic and good-neutral-evil) take 5d6 points of damage. Thus, if you are lawful good, you deal 2d6 points of damage to those of lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral good, or chaotic good alignment, and 5d6 points of damage to those of neutral, chaotic neutral, neutral evil, and chaotic evil alignment. A successful Fortitude save reduces damage in either case by half. Creatures of any alignment different from the caster's who fail their saving throws are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A deafened character, in addition to the obvious effects, automatically fails Listen checks, suffers a -4 penalty on initiative, and has a 20%% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal (V) component that he tries to cast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Chameleon.MOD				DESC:Subject gets +10 to Hide checks.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Chameleon.MOD				DESC:This spell alters the coloration of the recipient to match that of the surrounding background. The creature gains a +10 circumstance bonus on its Hide check. When moving through areas where the background changes gradually (such as stepping from the edge of a forest into a green field), the coloration changes immediately. When the background changes abruptly (from forest to gray stone wall), 1 round is required to effect the change in coloration. Material Component: The shed skin of a small lizard.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Circle of Flame.MOD			DESC:Flames deal 1d8+1/level damage in all directions.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Circle of Flame.MOD			DESC:Fire bursts in all directions from the point of origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20) to nearby creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloud Chariot.MOD				DESC:You and allies fly 100 miles in 10 minutes.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloud Chariot.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to soar on a magic chariot formed of cloud. When you cast the spell, you and any willing allies you are touching lift into the air on a small cloud and then fly away in whatever direction you desire. You fly at the incredible speed of 10 miles per minute, so that over the spell's duration you can cover a distance of 100 miles. You and your passengers feel none of the effects of this swift movement, and the ride is perfectly steady and calm-even in the worst weather. At the end of the spell, the cloud settles gently to the ground and disappears. Material Component: A small ball of cotton.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cobra's Breath.MOD			DESC:Spit poison in 10-ft. cone for 1d3 Con damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cobra's Breath.MOD			DESC:Your saliva changes into a virulent poison that you then spit forth in a 10-foot cone. Creatures within the cone must make a successful Fortitude saving throw or take 1d3 points of temporary Constitution damage. (There is no secondary damage.) The poison does not affect you. Material Component: A cobra's fang.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Commune with Greater Spirit.MOD	DESC:Ask any spirit one question/level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Commune with Greater Spirit.MOD	DESC:As commune with lesser spirit, but this spell can contact any spirit creature, whatever its Hit Dice. You can ask one question per level, but you must ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. The answers given are correct within the limits of the spirit's knowledge. "Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because even the greatest spirits are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the spirit's interests, the DM should give a short phrase (five words or less) as an answer instead. Material Component: Incense and a small offering worth 25 gp. XP Cost: 100 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Commune with Lesser Spirit.MOD	DESC:Lesser spirit answers one question/two levels.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Commune with Lesser Spirit.MOD	DESC:You contact a local spirit-any spirit creature with 4 or fewer HD. You must know the identity of the spirit (which you can learn through the trance spell), and you must be within 10 feet of the spirit's location. You may ask up to one question per 2 caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The spirit's knowledge is limited to matters within its immediate area, so the spirit of a great tree in the village could not answer questions about events outside the village. Spirits usually answer questions literally and do not volunteer any information. If the spirit's alignment is different from yours, the spirit gets a Will save to resist the spell. If the spirit has been subject to commune with lesser spirit within the past week, the new spell fails. Good spirits generally try to be helpful in answering questions, while evil spirits always try to distort the information they give (though they generally give literally truthful answers). Material Component: Incense and a small offering worth 10 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Compel.MOD					DESC:Changes the alignment of one creature.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Compel.MOD					DESC:You force the subject of the spell to change alignment, specifying the creature's new alignment. Creatures whose alignments are listed as "always" a specific alignment, and characters who would lose class abilities if they changed to the alignment you specify, gain a +4 bonus on their saving throws against the spell. Outsiders with an alignment-based type modifier (Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful) are immune to the effects of this spell. Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the spell thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. If the subject's comrades have an alignment outlook that differs significantly from his, he may abandon them or even take actions against them. This is up to the discretion of the DM; the spell has no effect on determining this, as it is more a matter of conscience. Another compel spell, a wish, or a miracle is required to reverse the effects of the spell; the subject makes no attempt to return to the former alignment. In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible. Thus, if a spellcaster were to cast compel upon him again, causing him to revert to his former alignment or following a new one, he would again receive a saving throw as outlined above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Create Spring.MOD				DESC:Creates a spring of fresh water.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Create Spring.MOD				DESC:A spring of water bubbles forth from the natural rock or earth you touch. The spring cannot arise from creatures, plants, or artificial constructions such as buildings. The spring puts forth six gallons of water per hour. The water is fresh, clear (at the source), and cool. No more than one spring may be created every 100 yards. Focus: A bamboo cane.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Creeping Darkness.MOD			DESC:Cloud of inky blackness moves at your command.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Creeping Darkness.MOD			DESC:This spell creates an amorphous cloud of inky blackness. You can shape and move the cloud as you desire during the duration of the spell if you maintain concentration on it and it remains within the range of the spell. You can move it up to 20 feet per round. It can seep through the smallest cracks and float through the air, as you desire. Creatures whose visual organs are within the cloud cannot see by normal vision or darkvision. The cloud also engulfs all sound within it, preventing creatures whose vocal organs are within the cloud from speaking or casting spells, and those whose auditory organs are within the cloud from hearing. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 5 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 2 rounds. Material Component: A whisker from an old black cat and a tiny bottle of smoke captured on a moonless night.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dance of the Unicorn.MOD		DESC:Purifying mist washes the air clean of smoke, dust, and poisons.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dance of the Unicorn.MOD		DESC:You surround yourself with a purifying swirling mist with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that washes the air clean of smoke, dust, and poisons. Nonmagical contaminants, including inhaled poisons, are automatically negated within the cloud. Magical effects, including acid fog, cloudkill, and green dragon breath, are negated only if your level is greater than the offending spell's caster level (or the dragon's HD). If your level is lower than the caster level, the dance of the unicorn grants everyone within the mist a +4 bonus on their saving throws against the effect. The cloud of mist leaves everything within its area damp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dancing Blade.MOD				DESC:Target sword fights independently.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dancing Blade.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you cause the target sword to hover and fight in the air, defending the character you designate. The sword must be either unattended or in the possession of the willing ally who will benefit from the spell. The sword fights using that character's base attack bonus and its base damage, with no adjustment for Strength or other ability scores. If the character is not proficient with the sword, the sword suffers a -4 penalty on its attack rolls. The sword stays within 5 feet of the character you designate, and drops to the ground if that character is dying or dead. Controlling the sword requires no concentration, and the character can fight with another weapon at the same time. The dancing blade prevents two opponents from receiving a flanking bonus against the character, though additional opponents can still gain a flanking bonus. Material Component: A tiny stick puppet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Decapitating Scarf.MOD			DESC:Successful ranged attack decapitates target.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Decapitating Scarf.MOD			DESC:As iron scarf, but if you succeed with your ranged attack roll, the scarf wraps around the target's neck. The target may then attempt a Fortitude saving throw; failure indicates that you are able to yank the scarf and decapitate the victim. This spell works only against creatures with heads, and decapitation is only effective against living creatures (except vampires). Oozes and many aberrations have no heads and are thus immune to this spell. Constructs and most undead are not harmed by the removal of their heads, so the spell is ineffective against them. Living creatures that make successful Fortitude saves take 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d4) before freeing themselves from the decapitating scarf.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Curse.MOD				DESC:Detects curses on one person or object.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Curse.MOD				DESC:You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been cursed or carries a curse. You can determine the general nature of the curse with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20). In scanning a cursed scroll, you could learn that the curse causes misfortune to the reader, but you could not tell the specific effects. If you succeed at the Spellcraft check, you receive a +4 bonus to your effective level when casting remove curse on the item or person analyzed with this spell. Note: The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Material Component: A small gem worth at least 10 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Disease.MOD			DESC:Detects disease in one creature or object.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Disease.MOD			DESC:You determine whether a creature, object, or area is infected with disease or carries disease. You can determine the exact type of disease with a successful Wisdom check (DC 20). A character with the Heal skill may try a Heal check (DC 20) if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Heal check prior to the Wisdom check. Note: The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Taint.MOD				DESC:Reveals Shadowlands Taint in creatures or objects.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Taint.MOD				DESC:You can sense the presence of the Shadowlands Taint. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject: 1st Round: Presence or absence of the Taint within the area. 2nd Round: Number of Tainted creatures in the area and the strength of the strongest Tainted aura present. If you are free of Taint, the strongest Tainted aura is "overwhelming" (see below), and the strength of the Tainted aura is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell-like ability ends. While stunned, you can't act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain a +2 bonus on attacks against you. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each Tainted aura. If a Tainted aura is outside your line of sight, you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Strength: The strength of a Tainted aura depends on the Taint score of the creature you are detecting. (A Shadowlands creature has a Taint score equal to half its Charisma score, +1 for undead and +2 for outsiders, such as Shadowlands oni.) Taint Score Aura Strength Lingering Dim 1 Faint 2-4 Moderate 5-10 Strong 11+ Overwhelming If an aura falls into more than one strength category, you learn the stronger of the two. Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength: Original Strength Duration Faint 1d6 minutes Moderate 1d6?10 minutes Strong 1d6 hours Overwhelming 1d6 days Each round, you can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Discern Shapechanger.MOD		DESC:Penetrates disguises and shape changes.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Discern Shapechanger.MOD		DESC:With a standard action spent in concentration, you can see the true form of polymorphed, disguised, or transmuted creatures within 60 feet. Each round, you can examine one creature you can see and determine whether it is polymorphed, disguised, or transmuted, and what its true form is. If you look at a shapechanger in its true form, you know that it is a shapechanger, but cannot determine what other forms it might be capable of assuming. For purposes of this spell, a shapechanger is any creature with the shapechanger type or a supernatural or extraordinary ability that allows it to assume an alternate form. A wu jen who knows polymorph self is not a shapechanger (since a spell is not a supernatural or extraordinary ability), but a spirit centipede is (since it has the exceptional ability to assume alternate forms, though its type is outsider). Material Component: A balm of honey and lotus flower, smeared on your eyelids.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dispel Taint.MOD				DESC:+4 bonus against attacks.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dispel Taint.MOD				DESC:Shimmering, white, holy energy surrounds you. This power has three effects: 1. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by Shadowlands creatures and creatures with a Taint score. 2. On making a successful melee touch attack against an oni or another outsider or elemental with the Shadowlands subtype, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature negates the effects with a Will save (SR applies). This use discharges and ends the spell. 3. With a touch, you can automatically dispel any one spell cast by a Tainted creature or any one maho spell. Exception: Spells that can't be dispelled by dispel magic also can't be dispelled by dispel Taint. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dream Sight.MOD				DESC:Your spirit can hear and see at a distance for 1 min./level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dream Sight.MOD				DESC:You fall into a deep sleep while your spirit leaves your body in incorporeal form and travels to distant locations. Your spirit can move 100 feet per round, and can see and hear anything you could if you were in the same location. The spirit can be blocked by any spell that wards incorporeal creatures, and it can be detected and attacked in the same way as incorporeal creatures can. A shaman can use commune with lesser spirit or commune with greater spirit (if you are over 4th level) to contact you, you cannot see creatures protected by invisibility to spirits, and you are warded by a protection from spirits spell. Your spirit can do nothing but move and observe-it cannot speak, attack, cast spells, or perform any other action. At the end of the spell, your spirit instantaneously returns to your body and you wake up. If your body is disturbed while your spirit is wandering, the spell ends immediately. Material Component: A stick of incense worth at least 5 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earthbolt.MOD				DESC:Flying earth deals 1d6/level to creatures along its path.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earthbolt.MOD				DESC:With a shout, you strike the ground at your feet and create a bolt of geomantic force. This bolt travels through the earth, causing the earth, rock, or sand to fly into the air, striking creatures along its path. A creature caught in the area takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). This spell functions only if you are standing on dirt, clay, stone, or sand. It does not function if you are on a wooden floor or other surface.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Elemental Burst.MOD			DESC:Target explodes in a burst of pure element (wood, metal, stone, fire, or water).|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Elemental Burst.MOD			DESC:When you cast this spell, you designate a target point-an item composed of one of the five elements (wood, fire, water, stone, or air). The item then releases the magical energy within it in a sudden, explosive burst. The effects of the burst depend on the element that makes up the target item: Wood, Metal, or Stone: The item throws off sharp slivers. Creatures within the burst take 1d8 points of damage (half with a successful Reflex save). Fire: The fire shoots out glowing sparks, causing 1d4 points of damage (no damage with a successful Reflex save). This is a fire effect. Water:Water pushes out in a sharp wave, knocking creatures within the burst prone. A successful Reflex save allows an affected creature to remain standing. Creatures add a +4 bonus on their saving throws for each size category they are larger than Medium-size, or a -4 penalty for each size category they are smaller than Medium-size. Creatures with more than two legs, or otherwise exceptionally stable creatures, get a +4 stability bonus. The spell does not noticeably affect the structure of the target item.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Elemental Ward.MOD			DESC:Drive elementals away.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Elemental Ward.MOD			DESC:This spell allows you to drive off elementals of a specific type by uttering a fearsome cry. When you cast the spell, all elementals within the spell's area flee the area unless they make successful Will saving throws. The spell ends if you try to force the barrier against an elemental that has failed its saving throw. Material Component: A small quantity of the element opposed to the type being warded against-fire for water elementals, earth for air elementals, air for earth elementals, or water for fire elementals.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Entangling Scarf.MOD			DESC:Scarf entangles a foe.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Entangling Scarf.MOD			DESC:This spell is similar to iron scarf, but you use the scarf to entangle a foe instead of dealing damage. As with iron scarf, you seize a silk scarf and lash it toward one creature within range, and the scarf magically extends to reach the target and wrap around it. You must have a line of sight to the target. You make a ranged attack roll on the target. If you hit, the target must make a successful saving throw or become entangled. An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity. The entangled creature cannot move. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with an Escape Artist check (DC 20), or the scarf can be burst with a Strength check (DC 26). Focus: A silk scarf.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fatigue.MOD					DESC:Creature touched becomes fatigued.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fatigue.MOD					DESC:The subject becomes fatigued, suffering an effective penalty of -2 to Strength and Dexterity. A fatigued character cannot run or charge and becomes exhausted by doing something that would normally cause fatigue. If the subject is already fatigued when you cast the spell, it becomes exhausted, moving at half normal speed and suffering an effective penalty of -6 to Strength and Dexterity. The subject can negate the effects of the spell through normal rest. The creature must rest for 8 hours to remove the fatigue.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fiery Eyes.MOD				DESC:Your eyes glow, illuminating area; focusing beams causes ignition.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fiery Eyes.MOD				DESC:This spell causes your eyes to glow with an unnatural fire. You can determine the color of the light, from a reddish glow to brilliant yellow. Your eyes project beams of bright light to a range of 3 feet, clearly illuminating the area. By fixing your sight on one spot within 3 feet of your eyes for 3 rounds, you can cause combustible materials, but not other creatures, to burst into flames. If other creatures carry or wear the affected items, however, these flames cause 1d6 points of damage to the creature immediately and may cause further damage (see Catching on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Finding the Center.MOD			DESC:Cast to maintain concentration without concentrating.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Finding the Center.MOD			DESC:As aiming at the target, except that you no longer need to maintain conscious concentration on the spell you cast before this one. Your unconscious mind maintains the concentration required for the spell. You can take other actions, including movement, attacks, and even spellcasting, as normal. The only way to disrupt your concentration on the other spell while finding the center is still in effect is to kill you or hamper your mind in some way (as through feeblemind, confusion, insanity, or dominate person).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Breath.MOD				DESC:You can breathe fire once/round; flame deals 1d8/2 levels (maximum 10d8) damage to one target within 15 ft.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Breath.MOD				DESC:You gain the ability to breathe a gout of flame as a standard action, once per round for the duration of the spell. The flame targets one creature within 15 feet of you, and you must succeed at a ranged touch attack to affect the target. If you succeed, the target takes 1d8 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8). Combustible objects may be ignited- attended or magic items must make saving throws or burst into flames.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Shuriken.MOD				DESC:Throw 3 or more shuriken formed of fire; each deals 1 point of damage + 1d4 fire damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Shuriken.MOD				DESC:This spell creates shuriken formed of magical fire that you can throw like normal shuriken (they do not burn your hands). You are automatically considered proficient with the fire shuriken. You create three fire shuriken if you are 1st to 6th level, six if you are 7th to 12th level, and nine if you are 13th level or higher. You can throw three fire shuriken as a standard action, but all three must target the same creature. If you create more than three shuriken, you can throw the remaining shuriken on subsequent rounds. They have a range increment of 10 feet. A single fire shuriken deals 1 point of normal damage and an additional 1d4 points of fire damage. If you score a critical hit, the shuriken damage is doubled and the fire damage increases to 1d8. Do not apply your Strength modifier to the shuriken damage. If you are making a sneak attack, add the extra damage only to the damage of the first shuriken you throw in a round. Material Component: A shuriken coated with pine sap and sulfur.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Wings.MOD				DESC:Your arms become flaming wings; you can fly or burn things.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Wings.MOD				DESC:This spell transforms your arms into wings of brilliant fire, resembling those of a phoenix. The flame does not damage you or any items you carry. Since your arms are transformed, you cannot hold items in your hands or cast spells while using the fire wings, but rings, bracers, and other items worn on your arms when you cast the spell still function normally. The wings allow you to fly at a speed of 60 feet, with good maneuverability. You can charge but not run while flying, and you cannot carry more than a light load aloft. If the spell duration expires while you are aloft, you fall normally. You can make unarmed attacks with the fire wings, but you are not considered proficient with them and thus suffer a -4 penalty on your attack rolls. A successful unarmed strike deals 2d6 points of fire damage in addition to your normal unarmed attack damage. The wings can be extinguished (and the spell canceled) by a quench spell, immersion in water, or a wind of hurricane or greater force. Material Component: The feather of a bird, which you must burn when you cast the spell. Focus: A golden amulet shaped like a phoenix.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fires of Purity.MOD			DESC:Target bursts into magical flame, becoming a dangerous weapon.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fires of Purity.MOD			DESC:The creature you touch bursts into magical flames that do not harm the target, but are quite capable of harming anyone else who comes into contact with them. The target deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with a successful melee attack. Creatures hitting the target with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take 1d6 points of fire damage, and must succeed at a Reflex save (the same DC as the spell) or catch fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds (see Catching on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide). A burning creature can take a move-equivalent action to put out the flame. The target gains fire immunity for the duration of the spell, but takes double damage from cold except on a successful save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Force Shapechange.MOD			DESC:Forces shapechangers into natural form.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Force Shapechange.MOD			DESC:With this spell, you force any shapechanger to revert into its true form. When you cast the spell, you specify the targets you know or believe to be shapechangers. Any shapechangers targeted by the spell must attempt Will saving throws. If they fail their saves, they revert to their true form amid wracking pain, which causes them 3d10 points of damage. If the saving throw is successful, they retain their current form, but still suffer extreme pain, taking half damage. The shapechanger is locked into its true form for 1 round per caster level, but the spell deals the 3d10 points of damage only when the change first occurs. For purposes of this spell, a shapechanger is any creature with the shapechanger type or a supernatural or extraordinary ability that allows it to assume an alternate form. A wu jen who knows polymorph self is not a shapechanger (since a spell is not a supernatural or extraordinary ability), but a spirit centipede is (since it has the exceptional ability to assume alternate forms, though its type is outsider). This spell has no effect on creatures under the effect of alter self, polymorph self, or other spell effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghost Light.MOD				DESC:Ghostly green radiance causes fear.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghost Light.MOD				DESC:With this spell, you create a ghostly green radiance anywhere within range that shines with the brightness of a torch. You can use the light to illuminate some object, or you can shape it in any form of Medium-size or smaller. You can control the movement of the light as long as you maintain concentration on the spell. Thus, you can shape the light into a human form and make it seem to walk or fly, for example. You can also change the shape of the light at any time during the spell's duration. The light is imbued with unearthly power, and causes fear in creatures within 30 feet of its location. Creatures in this area must make successful Will saving throws or become shaken, suffering a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws. Material Component: A bit of phosphorus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Giant Size.MOD				DESC:You become Huge or larger.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Giant Size.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, your body assumes truly gigantic proportions. The spell causes you to grow to Huge or larger size, depending on your caster level. Your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, natural armor, and size modifier to AC and attacks all change based on your new size, as shown on the table below. The only equipment that changes size with you is ordinary, mundane clothing, so you may not be able to use weapons or magic items effectively in your giant form. Material Component: The scale of a dragon or hairs from the head of a giant.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Spirit Ally.MOD			DESC:As lesser spirit ally, but up to 24 HD.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Spirit Ally.MOD			DESC:As lesser spirit ally, except you may call a single spirit of up to 24 HD or a number of spirits of the same type whose HD total no more than 24. The spirits agree to help you and request your return favor together.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Spirit Binding.MOD		DESC:As lesser spirit binding, but up to 24 HD.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Greater Spirit Binding.MOD		DESC:As lesser spirit binding, except you may call a single spirit of up to 24 HD or a number of spirits of the same type whose HD total no more than 24. Each spirit gets a saving throw, makes independent attempts to escape, and must be persuaded to aid you individually.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hail of Stone.MOD				DESC:Rain of stone makes ranged attack dealing 1d3/level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hail of Stone.MOD				DESC:You create a rain of stones, causing damage to creatures and objects within the area. Make a ranged attack roll (not a touch attack roll) on every creature and relevant object in the area. A successful hit deals 1d3 points of damage per level (maximum 5d3). Material Component: A piece of jade worth at least 5 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heart Ripper.MOD				DESC:Kills 1d4 living creatures with less than 2 HD.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heart Ripper.MOD				DESC:With the sweep of a hand, you send invisible bolts of force surging toward the targets. If a target has fewer than 5 Hit Dice and it fails its saving throw, the unleashed power caves in the creature's chest and drives its heart from the body, instantly killing the creature. This spell affects creatures with the fewest Hit Dice first and then affects those with the next lowest Hit Dice, and so on, until reaching the maximum given above or until it has targeted all creatures within the 20-foot cube. Undead, constructs, oozes, and other creatures with no anatomy or no heart are unaffected by the spell, as are all creatures with more than 5 Hit Dice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Horse's Nose.MOD				DESC:Grants the scent special ability.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Horse's Nose.MOD				DESC:You gain the Scent special ability (fully described in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). You can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. You can detect opponents by sense of smell within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet; if it is downwind, the range is only 15 feet. Strong and overpowering scents increase the range (as noted in the DMG). You can note a creature's presence; determining the direction of the scent requires a move-equivalent action, and you can pinpoint the creature's location if you move to within 5 feet of it. You can make a Wisdom check to find or follow a track by scent. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. Modifiers to the DC are listed in the DMG. Water ruins the trail. You can identify familiar odors just like you identify familiar sights. However, an odor is not necessarily familiar to you if your only previous exposure to it was while you were not under the influence of horse's nose. You only recognize odors that you could detect normally (without the aid of this spell).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Blast.MOD				DESC:Cone of ice deals 1d6 points of subdual damage/two levels and frostbite.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Blast.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you spit forth a cone of icy crystals, engulfing creatures within a cone area. Affected creatures are covered with a thin layer of ice, taking 1d6 points of subdual damage per two caster levels (maximum of 10d6). In addition, creatures suffer from a temporary frostbite condition, making them fatigued. Fatigued creatures cannot run or charge and suffer a -2 effective penalty to Strength and Dexterity. The frostbite effect lasts 3 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates both the subdual damage and the frostbite effect. Material Component: A mouthful of water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Knife.MOD				DESC:Dagger made of ice deals 1d8 damage plus 1d8 cold damage and 2 Dexterity damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Knife.MOD				DESC:A magical shard of ice springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed at a normal ranged attack to hit. For every two caster levels, you gain a +2 bonus on the ranged attack roll. The shard deals 1d8 points of piercing damage, plus 1d8 points of cold damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage. (Creatures that are immune to cold damage take no Dexterity damage.) A successful Fortitude save reduces the cold damage by half and negates the Dexterity damage. A miss creates a shower of ice crystals in a 10-foot-radius burst centered where the shard lands (see Grenadelike Weapon Attacks in the Player's Handbook). The icy burst deals 1d8 points of splash damage. A creature within the burst area can make a Reflex save to take half damage. Material Component: A drop of water or piece of ice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Internal Fire.MOD				DESC:Targets burst into flame from the inside out.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Internal Fire.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a deadly raging heat in the internal organs of the targets, causing them to burst into flame from the inside. Death occurs instantly. A successful Fortitude save instead deals 6d6 points of damage, +1 point per caster level. Focus: An iron brazier filled with red-hot charcoal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility to Enemies.MOD		DESC:As invisibility to spirits, but all hostile creatures are affected.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility to Enemies.MOD		DESC:As invisibility to spirits, but the warded creature is invisible to all creatures who may have hostile intentions against it. Mindless creatures are not affected by the spell and can see the warded creature normally, since they are incapable of forming hostile intentions. Animals and other creatures with Intelligence scores lower than 5 are also not affected, since their motivations are based on survival, not on hostile intent. Focus: A white robe covered with handwritten symbols and verses.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility to Spirits.MOD		DESC:Spirits can't perceive 1 subject/level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility to Spirits.MOD		DESC:If a spirit fails its saving throw, it can't perceive the warded creatures and acts as though the warded creatures are not there. The warded creatures can move freely among spirits without being noticed, although they are perfectly visible to all other types of creatures. If a warded creature touches or attacks a spirit (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients. Note: A spirit gets one saving throw against the spell. It either sees all the warded creatures or none of them. Material Component: Red ink, with which you write prayers and scriptures on each warded creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Iron Scarf.MOD				DESC:Silk scarf becomes ranged weapon dealing 1d8+1/level damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Iron Scarf.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you seize a silk scarf and lash it toward one creature within range. You must have a line of sight to the target. You make a ranged attack roll on the target as the scarf magically extends and becomes as hard as iron on impact. If you hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +5). Focus: A silk scarf.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Jade Aura.MOD				DESC:+4 AC, +4 resistance, and 25 SR against evil spells.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Jade Aura.MOD				DESC:A radiance of shimmering jade color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to maho and other evil magic, and blinding Tainted and Shadowlands creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects. First, the warded creatures gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from Taint, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by Tainted creatures. Second, the warded creatures gain SR 25 against evil spells and spells cast by maho-tsukai, oni, or other Tainted or Shadowlands creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from Taint does. Finally, if a creature with a Taint score or the Shadowlands subtype succeeds at a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blindness/deafness, but against jade aura's save DC). Focus: A tiny statue carved from jade, representing one of the Seven Fortunes. The statue costs at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Jade Strike.MOD				DESC:Damages and blinds Shadowlands creatures.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Jade Strike.MOD				DESC:You call up holy jade power to smite your enemies. Only Tainted creatures, undead, and creatures with the Shadowlands subtype are harmed by the spell; other creatures are unaffected. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to undead and creatures with the Shadowlands subtype, and blinds them for 1 round. A successful Reflex save reduces damage to half and negates the blinding effect. The spell deals only half damage against creatures with a Taint score (and without the Shadowlands subtype), and they are not blinded. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Reflex save. In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50%% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Kiss of the Toad.MOD			DESC:Poisonous touch deals 1d6 Con damage, repeats in 1 min|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Kiss of the Toad.MOD			DESC:Your touch becomes poisonous, inflicting poison upon a creature you touch with a successful melee touch attack. The poison deals 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage immediately and another 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 caster's level + caster's Intelligence modifier). Focus: A tattoo of a toad on your skin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know Motivation.MOD			DESC:Sense basic needs and emotions of creatures.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know Motivation.MOD			DESC:You can sense the basic needs, drives, and emotions of creatures within the spell area. Each round, you can focus your attention on one creature within the area and learn what is currently motivating its actions-for example, hunger, thirst, fear, fatigue, pain, uncertainty, rage, hatred, curiosity, hostility, friendliness, love, and so on. Focus: A prayer written on a strip of cloth and tied around your forehead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know the Shadows.MOD			DESC:+20 to Hide checks in darkened areas.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know the Shadows.MOD			DESC:You bend surrounding shadows and blend them to yourself, making yourself one with the darkness. As long as you remain within 10 feet of some kind of shadow (except your own shadow) or within at least moderate darkness, your ability to hide is greatly enhanced. You can hide yourself from view in the open without anything to hide behind, even while being observed, and you gain a +20 circumstance bonus on Hide checks. Unlike invisibility, this spell's effects do not end when you attack, though you cannot hide and attack at the same time. You are clearly visible while attacking (and thus do not gain a +2 bonus on your attack for being invisible, nor is your target denied its Dexterity bonus to AC), but you can use a moveequivalent action to hide again after attacking (or hide as part of a move action), and you still gain the +20 circumstance bonus on your Hide check. Your opponent can ready an action to attack you when you come into view to attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Spirit Ally.MOD			DESC:Exchange services with an 8 HD spirit.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Spirit Ally.MOD			DESC:By casting this spell, you request the services of a spirit (of up to 8 HD) that shares your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual spirit's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the casting of the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask the spirit to perform one task for you, and the spirit may request some service in return. The more demanding your request, the greater return favor the spirit asks for. This bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the spirit begin in the round after it arrives. If you agree to the service, the spirit performs the task you requested, reports back to you afterward (if possible), and returns to its home. You are honor bound to perform the return favor. A spirit may accept some form of payment, such as a magic item, in return for its service. The spirit may keep it or may deliver the item to another shaman somewhere else, where it can help the spirit's cause. Note: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, lesser spirit ally is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Spirit Binding.MOD		DESC:Traps spirit until it performs a task|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lesser Spirit Binding.MOD		DESC:Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a spirit to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called spirit is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The type of spirit to be bound must be known and stated. If it has a specific, proper, or given name, this must be used in casting the spell. The target spirit must attempt a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the spirit is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep the creature from being called). The spirit can escape from the trap with a successful SR roll, dimensional travel, or a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor cast on the spirit prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see Calling in the Player's Handbook) to make the trap more secure. If the spirit does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the spirit to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the spirit's Charisma check. The DM then assigns a bonus based on the service and reward, from +0 to +6. This bonus applies to your Charisma check. If the spirit wins the opposed check, it refuses service. You can make new offers, bribes, and the like or offer again the old ones every 24 hours. You can repeat this until the spirit promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the spirit breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the spirit need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The spirit might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the spirit cannot complete though its own actions (such as "Wait here" or "Defend this area against attack"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the spirit gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, lesser spirit binding is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lightning Blade.MOD			DESC:Creates sword blade of crackling energy; deals total 1d6 damage/level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lightning Blade.MOD			DESC:When you cast this spell, a sword blade of crackling electrical energy appears in the hand of the creature you touch (who must be a willing recipient). It is the size of a normal longsword, but is virtually weightless. It is treated as a martial weapon for purposes of determining who is proficient with its use. The wielder can use the blade in two ways-to make a melee touch attack to deliver electrical damage, or to fire a bolt of lightning as a ranged touch attack with an absolute range of 30 feet. Over the entire duration of the spell, the blade can deliver damage up to 1d6 per caster level (maximum 10d6). For any given attack, the blade's wielder decides (before making an attack roll) how many dice the blade deals with a successful hit, up to the maximum damage potential remaining in the spell. If the attack roll is successful, the blade deals the specified damage to the target. If the attack roll misses, those dice of damage are lost. Since the blade is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier does not apply to the damage, which is all electricity damage. It can harm any creature that is harmed by electricity. The spell does not function underwater.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Circle against Taint.MOD	DESC:As protection from Taint, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Circle against Taint.MOD	DESC:As protection from Taint, except that it encompasses a much larger area and its duration is longer. Unlike protection from Taint, this spell has a special function that you may choose when casting the spell. A magic circle can be focused inward rather than outward. In this case, it serves as an immobile, temporary magical prison for a called creature. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. (See Calling in the Player 's Handbook for more information on using this spell in conjunction with calling spells.) You must beat a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from Taint spell for that creature only. This spell is not cumulative with protection from Taint and vice versa.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magnetism.MOD				DESC:Draw iron or steel objects to yourself.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magnetism.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to draw iron or steel objects to yourself by projecting a magnetic ray at any object within range. The magnetic ray draws objects toward you with an effective Strength score of 30. Each round the spell lasts, you can target one item with a ranged touch attack. If you hit an item that another creature is holding (such as a weapon), you and the creature holding the item must make opposed rolls, as if you were making a normal disarm attempt. You add your base attack bonus and the ray's Strength bonus (+10) to your roll. Your opponent uses a melee attack roll, modified by +4 if she is using a weapon in two hands. If the weapon is larger or smaller than your size, your opponent gets an additional +/-4 per size category difference. If you win the opposed roll, the weapon flies from your opponent's hand to your own. If you hit an attended item, such as a weapon at someone's belt, the creature wearing the item can make a Reflex save to keep hold of the item. If you hit an unattended item that is not secured or too heavy for the ray to lift, it flies to your hand. If the item is secured in some way, you can make a Strength check (using the Strength bonus of the ray) to break or burst whatever is securing it. Material Component: A piece of lodestone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Master of the Rolling River.MOD	DESC:Wave of water deals 1d8/two levels damage and bull rush.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Master of the Rolling River.MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you create a huge wave of water that slams into one or more targets within range. If there is no large, natural source of water (a river, lake, or ocean) within the spell range, you can affect only one target. If such a source of water exists within the range of the spell, the spell creates a burst centered on a location you designate. In either case, the water deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 7d8) to the target or to creatures within the area. In addition, all affected creatures suffer a bull rush attack, forcing them to make opposed Strength checks against the wave of water. The water has an effective Strength of 16 and is considered Medium-size (or 20 and Large if cast near water). You designate the direction the wave pushes when you cast the spell; creatures who lose the opposed Strength check are pushed 5 feet, plus 1 foot for every point by which the wave beats their Strength checks, in that direction. It is possible for a wave arising from a body of water to push characters into the water. The wave puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames if they are carried by the target or located within the area and they are of Large size or smaller. Magical fires are targeted by a dispel magic effect as if you had cast that spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Melt.MOD					DESC:Melt ice and snow or deal 2 points of damage/level to cold creatures.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Melt.MOD					DESC:This spell allows you to melt ice and snow or deal damage to cold creatures. You can melt ice or snow as specified above, with no saving throw or spell resistance applicable. Targeted cold creatures take 2 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10 points), half with a successful saving throw. A creature's spell resistance applies. Material Component: A few crystals of rock salt and a pinch of soot.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Metal Skin.MOD				DESC:This spell transforms the skin of the recipient into a gleaming metallic surface. The recipient's natural armor bonus becomes +8 (unless it was already better than +8), but the creature also becomes somewhat slow and stiff, suffering a -2 penalty to effective Dexterity for the duration of the spell. Material Component: A small piece of rhinoceros hide.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Minute Form.MOD				DESC:You become Tiny or smaller.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Minute Form.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, your body becomes very small. The spell causes you to shrink to Tiny or smaller size, depending on your caster level. Your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and size modifier to AC and attacks all change based on your new size, as shown on the table below. None of your ability scores can be reduced below 1 by this spell. The only equipment that changes size with you is ordinary, mundane clothing, so you may not be able to use weapons or magic items effectively in your minute form. Material Component: A flea.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty to -2. Material Component: A live leech|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Poison Needles.MOD			DESC:As rain of needles, but the needles drip with poison. You can attack only one target, and you must succeed on a normal ranged attack to harm the target. If you hit, the target suffers the effect of the poison needles. You can choose one of the following effects: . 1d8 points of temporary Constitution damage immediately and another 1d8 points of temporary Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 caster's level + caster's Intelligence modifier). . Paralysis for 2d6 minutes, negated by a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 caster's level + caster's Intelligence modifier). . 1d10 points of temporary Dexterity damage immediately and another 1d10 points of temporary Dexterity damage 1 minute later.

Possess.MOD					DESC:As possess animal, but you can take over the body of any creature. The possessed creature retains no memory of actions performed during the possession or knowledge of who possessed it. Material Component: A bowl of incense.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Possess Animal.MOD			DESC:Your soul inhabits and controls an animal's body.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Possess Animal.MOD			DESC:By casting this spell, you project your spirit into the body of an animal, forcing the animal to behave as you direct it. Your own body lies lifeless for the duration of the spell. The animal must be a normal animal (not a beast, magical beast, vermin, or other monster type) and must have fewer Hit Dice than your level. The animal's soul remains in its body, but it has no control over that body while your spirit is there. While in the animal's body, you keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. For every 2 points of damage taken by the animal body while you are possessing it, you take 1 point of damage as well. If the animal body is killed while you are possessing it, you must make a Fortitude save (DC 10) or die as well. If your body is destroyed while your spirit is in the animal's body, you die at the end of the spell's duration. Material Component: A bowl of incense and a morsel of food appealing to the animal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Protection from Charm.MOD		DESC:The recipient of this spell gains a +1 resistance bonus for every three caster levels (maximum +5) on any Will saving throw against charm or compulsion effects. Material Component: A piece or hair or other item from the body of a creature with an innate charm or dominate person ability, such as a succubus or vampire.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Protection from Spirits.MOD		DESC:Keeps spirits at bay.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Protection from Spirits.MOD		DESC:This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 5 feet. The barrier moves with the subject and has two major effects. First, the subject gets a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against attacks made by spirits. Second, the barrier prevents spirits from entering the area. This protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against a blocked spirit. Spell resistance can allow a spirit to overcome this protection and enter the circle. Focus: A gingko wand with paper prayer strips attached.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Protection from Taint.MOD		DESC:+2 AC and saves, counter mind control, hedge out oni.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Protection from Taint.MOD		DESC:This spell wards a creature from attacks by Shadowlands creatures and creatures with the Shadowlands Taint, from mental control, and from summoned or conjured creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects: First, the subject gets a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made by creatures with the Shadowlands subtype and creatures with a Taint score. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over the creature (as by a vampire's supernatural domination ability, which works similar to dominate person). The protection does not prevent a vampire's domination itself, but it prevents the vampire from mentally commanding the protected creature. If the protection from Taint effect ends before the domination effect does, the vampire would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures (see the Monster Manual). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good elementals and outsiders are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rain of Needles.MOD			DESC:Ranged attacks deal 1d4 damage/level to a number of targets up to your level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rain of Needles.MOD			DESC:When you cast this spell, you hurl a needle in the direction of one target. The spell multiplies this single needle into a hail of needles that deal damage to the targets you select. You make a normal ranged attack against each target separately, suffering no penalty for lack of proficiency. The needles, combined, do 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d4), but you can divide this damage up among the targets you select. Thus, a 4th-level wu jen can target a single creature with an attack that deals 4d4 points of damage if successful, two creatures for 2d4 points of damage each, four creatures for 1d4 points of damage each, or some other division of the damage dice. Material Component: A long metal needle.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reanimation.MOD				DESC:Dead creature restored to half-life with 1 hp.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reanimation.MOD				DESC:You restore a semblance of life to a deceased creature. You can reanimate creatures that have been dead up to one day per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return (see Bringing Back the Dead in the Player's Handbook). If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work. This spell cannot fully bind the soul back into the body, and the reanimated subject is in a state of halflife- neither dead nor fully alive. The reanimated creature has 1 hit point and can take only a single move-equivalent action each round. It cannot attack, use spells, or activate magic items. It can speak (if it could while fully alive), but its speech is slow and slurred. The creature's memory is cloudy and confused, and it has trouble remembering even the basic details of its past life and friends. If left unwatched, the creature is prone to wander off randomly with no conception of where it is going or where it has been. If wounded again, the creature can be healed, but cannot rise above 1 hit point. It can gain temporary hit points, but cannot increase its hit point total through Constitution increase or any other means. The creature can be killed again (and reanimated again), and it can be restored to full life through any spell that would restore a fully dead creature to life (such as raise dead). As with gentle repose, time spent reanimated does not count against the time limit on raising the creature from the dead. The body does not decay while it is reanimated. A reanimated creature is not undead, and cannot be turned, harmed by positive energy or holy water, or healed by negative energy. A greater restoration spell fully restores the creature's memory but does not improve its physical state. Arcane Material Component: A white shawl and incense. Divine Material Component: A strip of white cloth inscribed with prayers and a stick of incense. Arcane Focus: A golden amulet shaped like a phoenix.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Rebuke.MOD					DESC:With a thunderous rebuke, you stun one creature of your choice within range. If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, it is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC. Attackers gain a +2 bonus to attack it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Remove Fatigue.MOD			DESC:The creatures you touch gain the benefits of 8 hours of restful sleep. If a subject was fatigued, the fatigue and its penalties are removed. If a subject was already well rested, it does not need to rest or sleep during the next 24 hours. Arcane spellcasters must still rest their minds for 8 hours in order to prepare or ready their spells.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scales of the Lizard.MOD		DESC:Scaly skin grants +2 natural armor bonus to AC.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scales of the Lizard.MOD		DESC:When you cast this spell, your skin toughens and shimmers as if covered with scales. You gain a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +3 at 3rd level, +4 at 6th level, and +5 at 12th level and up. Since the AC bonus is a natural armor bonus, it does not stack with any natural armor you may already have. Focus: A tattoo of a lizard on your skin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secret Signs.MOD				DESC:Target understands your nonverbal message.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secret Signs.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to communicate a simple message to one other intelligent creature within range, using nonverbal means. You can wave a hand, place a scroll on a table, raise an eyebrow, or make any other sign, and the spell allows the target to understand your message. You can communicate a complete thought of twenty-five words or less by means of this spell, and the target understands your message despite any barrier of language. You can use this spell even if you are bound and gagged, so long as the focus item is on your person. Focus: A small glass cone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Servant Horde.MOD				DESC:Create 2d6+1/level (max. +15) unseen servants.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Servant Horde.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a number of invisible, mindless, shapeless forces that perform simple tasks at your command. They can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. They can also be used for common laboring tasks, provided that you carefully direct them. They could serve at a banquet, help dig earthworks, row a ship, act as porters, or assist in a farmer's fields. Each servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so, thus allowing you to command one servant to clean the floor and then turn your attention elsewhere as long as you remain within range. Servants can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and so forth. They have an effective Strength score of 2 (so they can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). They can trigger traps and such, but they can exert only 20 pounds of force, and that is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. Their speed is 15 feet. The servants cannot attack in any way; they are never allowed an attack roll. They cannot be killed, but they dissipate if they take 6 points of damage from area attacks. (They get no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send a servant beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), that servant ceases to exist. Material Component: A small stick crossbar to which many lengths of knotted thread are attached.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Smoke Ladder.MOD				DESC:Smoke transforms into ladder up to 10-ft. long/level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Smoke Ladder.MOD				DESC:Using this spell, you can mold and shape ordinary smoke into a misty ladder. Reaching into the smoke given off by a fire, you cast the spell while shaping the ladder. The ladder weighs virtually nothing, and you can easily handle a smoke ladder of any length. Furthermore, the ladder is always steady and rigid; it need not be supported or leaned against an object. You simply place it in the desired position and climb. You can extend the spell's duration by casting the spell again on the smoke ladder. Focus: A large fire of green wood.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snake Barrier.MOD				DESC:Keeps reptiles at bay.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snake Barrier.MOD				DESC:This spell creates an invisible barrier that prevents reptiles, reptilian creatures, and dragons from crossing it. Affected creatures are aware of the barrier's presence and purpose, and reptiles that are not overtly hostile avoid the barrier and those protected by it. Reptilian creatures with hostile intent may try to penetrate the barrier. Affected creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice must make a successful Will saving throw to cross at all. Any affected creature that crosses the barrier takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), with a successful Fortitude saving throw reducing the damage by half. Intelligent reptilian creatures that encounter the barrier usually find it infuriating, and are much less likely to befriend and aid the caster. Material Component: A shed snakeskin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snake Darts.MOD				DESC:Two snakes hit one or two targets, dealing 2d6 damage each and injecting poison (1d6 Condamage, repeats in 1 min.)|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snake Darts.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, your snake tattoos (the spell's focus) transform into real snakes that fly from you to the target or targets you select, striking like darts and injecting poison into the victims. The snakes always hit, and deal 2d6 points of damage from the impact alone. The poison deals 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage immediately and another 1d6 points of temporary Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of ability damage can be negated by a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 caster's level + caster's Intelligence modifier). After striking the targets, the snakes fly back to you. You must swallow the living snakes before you can cast the spell again; doing so is a standard action that causes you no harm. When you swallow the snakes, the tattoos reappear on your arms. Focus: Two snake tattoos on your skin, usually one coiled around each forearm.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Spirit Needle.MOD				DESC:Needle pins spirit in place, in corporeal form.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spirit Needle.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you hurl a long needle at a spirit creature, making a normal ranged attack against the spirit. The needle can hit incorporeal and even ethereal creatures, though it has no enhancement bonus. If you hit, the spirit becomes corporeal and is held in place, unable to move for the duration of the spell (though it can still take nonmovement actions, including attacks). The spirit takes no damage from the needle, but it becomes much more vulnerable to further attacks, losing any Dexterity bonus to AC and giving attackers a +4 bonus on attack rolls, in addition to losing the protective benefits of incorporeality. The spirit cannot remove the needle that pins it in place, but another creature can remove it by using the aid another action. A pinned spirit is unable to use any supernatural or spell-like ability to alter its substance (such as gaseous form, ethereal jaunt, or becoming incorporeal again) or transport itself (including dimension door and teleport). Focus: A long metal needle.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spirit Self.MOD				DESC:Your incorporeal spirit separates from your body.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spirit Self.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to send your spirit outside your body in an incorporeal form, while maintaining some semblance of life in your physical body. Your spirit has a speed of 90 feet, but it cannot move more than 200 feet from your body. Your spirit can be blocked by any spell that wards incorporeal creatures, and it can be detected and attacked in the same way as incorporeal creatures can. A shaman can use commune with lesser spirit or commune with greater spirit (if you are higher than 4th level) to contact you, you cannot see creatures protected by invisibility to spirits, and you are warded by a protection from spirits spell. Your spirit can cast spells that have only verbal components, but it cannot otherwise attack or affect the physical world. Your body, meanwhile, assumes a half-awake state. In your spirit form, you can issue commands to your body as long as you are within 5 feet of it. It can take only simple actions- walking, talking (in a slow, slurred fashion), or eating. It is not helpless, but it can only take partial actions. It loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), and foes gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it. Damage taken by either your spirit or your body is subtracted from your hit point total. If either your spirit or your body is destroyed, you die. If your body moves more than 200 feet from you, and your spirit is unable to follow (because of a protection from spirits spell or some other reason), you die. If you are otherwise prevented from returning to your body at the expiration of the spell, you die. Material Component: A small prayer wheel.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Steam Breath.MOD				DESC:1d6 damage per level, 30-ft. cone.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Steam Breath.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to expel a powerful breath of superheated steam, which billows forth from your mouth and fills a cone with scalding clouds of mist. Creatures within the cone take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). The steam clouds dissipate instantly after their damage is done. Material Component: A glowing piece of charcoal doused with water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Substitution.MOD				DESC:Half the damage you take is transferred to a figure of a spirit or deity.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Substitution.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a mystic connection between you and a specially prepared figure representing your deity or a spirit you revere. For the duration of the spell, you take only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those inflicted by special abilities) that deal you hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by you is taken by the figure instead. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and disintegration, are not affected. If you suffer a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with the figure because it is not hit point damage. The spell is discharged when the figure runs out of hit points (i.e. when they reach 0).When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the figure, but damage already split is not reassigned to you. Material Component: Offerings to a spirit you revere worth 10 gp. Focus: A figure of a spirit you revere, made of glass, wood, stone, or iron. The statue's hit points and cost depend on the substance of which it is made. A glass figure has 10 hit points and costs 25 gp, a wood figure has 25 hit points and costs 250 gp, a stone figure has 50 hit points and costs 375 gp, and an iron figure has 100 hit points and costs 750 gp. You may use this figure for multiple castings of this spell, but you cannot repair it or restore its lost hit points.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summoning Wind.MOD			DESC:Send a short message 10 miles/level to ten creatures/level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summoning Wind.MOD			DESC:You send a message or sound on the wind to a number of specific creatures that you identify while casting the spell. The specific identity of each recipient need not be known, but you must be able to distinguish them by their position or some feature other than race or character class. For example, you could send the message to the soldiers of your palace guard or to the governors of all the provinces in the empire. The summoning wind travels to each recipient, provided that it can find a way from you to their locations. (It can't pass through walls, for instance.) The summoning wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the recipients. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound and dissipates. You can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the summoning wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the summoning wind to move as slowly as one mile per hour or as quickly as one mile per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, summoning wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. This spell is commonly used to rally troops, send warnings, or disseminate proclamations.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Surelife.MOD				DESC:Protects you from one kind of certain death.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Surelife.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to protect yourself against some condition- such as being immersed in boiling oil or being buried under an avalanche-that would ordinarily cause certain death. You can only protect yourself against a natural occurrence or condition, not against a spell or the action of a creature (such as the breath of a dragon or the swords of a group of bandits). You must specify the condition against which you wish to protect yourself, and the spell is effective only against that condition. Should you be subjected to that condition during the duration of the spell, you feel no discomfort and take no damage from the condition. However, the spell does not protect any items carried on your person. At the end of the spell's duration, the condition has full normal effects on you if you are still subjected to it. Material Component: An ointment of peach syrup and cinnabar.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sustain.MOD					DESC:Recipients need no food or drink for 6 hours/level.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sustain.MOD					DESC:The recipients of the spell can go without food or water for the duration of the spell, feeling no hunger and suffering no ill effects from the deprivation. An affected creature can eat or drink normally without difficulty. When the spell ends, the creatures must resume normal eating and drinking habits, but do not feel any adverse effects from the missed meals. The size of the creature is not a factor; a tiny lizard and a dragon are both fully nourished by the spell. If a target of the spell is suffering from hunger and thirst, the spell relieves the creature as if it had eaten one healthy meal for every 6 hours of the spell's duration. Material Component: A flask of warm sake and a rice cake.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Swim.MOD					DESC:Subject can swim like a native swimmer.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Swim.MOD					DESC:This spell gives the recipient the ability to swim with the ease of a fish, though it does not impart the ability to breathe water. The creature can swim at its normal (land) speed without making Swim checks, so long as it is not carrying more than a light load. It gains a +8 competence bonus on any Swim checks to perform some special action or avoid a hazard, though it still suffers the normal penalty for weight carried (-1 per 5 pounds carried). It can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened when swimming. The creature can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. If the creature is carrying more than a light load, it still gains the +8 competence bonus on Swim checks, but it must make Swim checks to move (including the normal penalty for weight carried). The other benefits of the spell still apply. Material Component: A goldfish scale.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sword of Darkness.MOD			DESC:Blade of negative energy attacks your opponents.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sword of Darkness.MOD			DESC:A blade made of pure negative energy appears and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal creatures. The blade attacks with your base attack bonus and bestows one negative level per hit. It threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 and bestows two negative levels with a critical hit. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as HD, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: -1 competence penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from her highest available level. Negative levels stack. Assuming the subject survives, he regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level. Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the subject's levels, but the negative levels from the sword of darkness don't last long enough to do so. If the sword strikes an undead creature, it gives that creature 5 temporary hit points per two caster levels (maximum 25 temporary hit points) for 1 hour. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon, but your lack of proficiency does not hinder it either. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). Subsequent rounds of attacking the same target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if its base attack bonus would allow it to. The sword of darkness cannot be attacked or damaged. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the sword of darkness strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. Material Component: A katana or long sword worth at least 100 gp, which is shattered against a stone while casting the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sword of Deception.MOD			DESC:Blade of energy attacks your opponents and reduces their next saving throw rolls.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sword of Deception.MOD			DESC:A blade made of pale green force appears and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal creatures. The blade attacks with the base attack bonus of a fighter whose level is equal to your caster level, and it deals 1d4 points of damage per hit. It threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 and deals double damage with a critical hit. In addition, each hit on a single creature inflicts a -1 luck penalty on that creature's next saving throw roll (-2 with a critical hit). Successive hits increase this penalty, to a maximum of -5 on a single creature. This saving throw penalty lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation. Remove curse and similar spells can cancel the penalty. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). Subsequent rounds of attacking the same target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if its base attack bonus would allow it to. The sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the sword of deception strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. Focus: A miniature replica of a sword and a set of loaded dice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Terra Cotta Lion.MOD			DESC:As terra cotta warrior, but creates a Huge animated object.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Terra Cotta Lion.MOD			DESC:As terra cotta warrior, but the spell animates a statuette of a foo lion (a celestial dire lion) into a Huge animated object. Like a terra cotta warrior, a terra cotta lion has improved speed (30 feet) and a hardness of 6. It has none of the special attack forms described in the Monster Manual. Focus: A terra cotta statue of a foo lion, up to 1 foot tall and costing 10 gp. If the terra cotta lion remains intact at the end of the spell, the statuette can be reused. Otherwise, it must be repaired or replaced.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Terra Cotta Warrior.MOD			DESC:Enlarges and animates a statuette as a Medium-size animated object to fight for you.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Terra Cotta Warrior.MOD			DESC:Terra cotta statues are popular items of decoration and devotion. This spell turns an innocuous statuette, no more than 6 inches tall, into a full-sized warrior, ready to fight your foes. The statuette becomes a Medium-size animated object, as described in the Monster Manual. The statuette has a speed of 40 feet and a hardness of 6. It has none of the special attack forms described in the Monster Manual. Focus: A terra cotta statue of a warrior, up to 6 inches tall and costing 1 gp. If the terra cotta warrior remains intact at the end of the spell, the statuette can be reused. Otherwise, it must be repaired or replaced.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tetsubo of Earth.MOD			DESC:Melee attack deals 1d10+1/two levels damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tetsubo of Earth.MOD			DESC:A 6-foot-long tetsubo formed of earth springs forth from your hands. You wield this weapon with proficiency as if it were a greatclub. Attacks with the tetsubo of earth are regular melee attacks. The tetsubo deals 1d10 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). The tetsubo is considered a +1 weapon for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thornskin.MOD				DESC:You grow thorns; your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 damage and creatures hitting you with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take 1d4 damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thornskin.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you become so completely attuned to the element of wood that your skin sprouts thorns all over. These thorns do not damage you, but they both increase the damage you can deal with an unarmed attack and make you a dangerous person to grab. When you make a successful unarmed attack, you deal 1d6 points of normal, not subdual, piercing damage. If you already deal extra damage, because you are a multiclassed monk or for any other reason, your damage increases by one die type: 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, 1d10 to 1d12, 1d12 to 1d20, 1d20 to 2d12. If you have another form of natural attack, such as a claw attack, use 1d6 or your claw damage, whichever is better. A creature that hits you with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, including an attempt to grapple, takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Material Component: A thorn.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tomb of Jade.MOD				DESC:Entraps and harms Shadowlands creatures.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tomb of Jade.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you attempt to draw out the impure substance of a Tainted creature and replace it with your own pure substance. The spell is draining for you to cast, but it is deadly to creatures that are infected with the Shadowlands Taint. You can only cast this spell on a Shadowlands creature (a creature with the Shadowlands subtype or with a Taint score). When you touch the creature, it must make a Fortitude saving throw. If it succeeds, it is unaffected by the spell. If it fails, its skin turns to jade and it is immobilized, standing helpless. The creature is aware and breathes normally, but cannot take any physical actions, even speech. It can, however, execute purely mental actions (such as using a spell-like ability). The effect is similar to that of hold person. Each round you maintain the spell, the creature must attempt another Fortitude save. If it fails the save, it takes 1d6 points of permanent Constitution drain. Each round you maintain the spell, however, you take 1d6 points of subdual damage. If you fall unconscious, or if the creature succeeds at its Fortitude save, the spell ends. Material Component: A finger of jade worth at least 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trance.MOD					DESC:Meditate to learn about nearby spirits.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trance.MOD					DESC:You place yourself in a deep trance, during which you cannot move, speak, or take any action. In the trance, you are highly attuned to the powers and forces in the immediate area. You can sense certain magical creatures and effects within the spell's area. Each round you remain in the trance, you feel the presence of any one lesser spirit, greater spirit, curse, permanent magical effect, or haunting within the spell's area. You can determine the general type of thing contacted (such as natural spirit, evil haunting), but cannot communicate with it in any way or gain any other information about it. Using this spell does give you enough information to subsequently cast commune with lesser spirit or a similar spell to communicate with the spirit you desire to contact.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Transfix.MOD				DESC:Humanoids freeze in place until condition you specify is met.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Transfix.MOD				DESC:This spell causes humanoids of Medium-size or smaller within the area to freeze in place, standing helpless as if affected by the hold person spell. When casting the spell, you must specify some condition that must be met to release the victims-"Wait here until I return," or "Stay here for all eternity!" for example. You may specify any condition, however implausible, but the spell ends as soon as that condition is met. For every hour the creatures are transfixed, they can attempt another saving throw. The spell affects an area, not (directly) the creatures in it, so creatures that are removed from the area are freed from the spell's effects, and humanoids of Medium-size or smaller that enter the area must make a successful saving throw or become transfixed. If all affected creatures are freed from the spell, the spell ends and additional creatures entering the area are not affected. Material Component: A drop of pine resin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vulnerability.MOD				DESC:Reduces an opponent's damage reduction.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vulnerability.MOD				DESC:This spell lowers the subject's damage reduction value by 5/+1. Thus, if you successfully cast vulnerability on a dragon with damage reduction 15/+2, its damage reduction becomes 10/+1. For every three caster levels beyond 11th, the damage reduction decreases by an additional 5/+1: 10/+2 at 14th, 15/+3 at 17th, and 20/+4 at 20th.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Bones.MOD				DESC:Creates a bone wall that can be shaped.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Bones.MOD				DESC:This spell causes a wall of bones to erupt from the earth in whatever shape you desire, as long as it is solidly based on the ground. You cannot conjure the wall so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall is not solid, having many small openings and gaps. Creatures behind the wall have three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side of the wall. Creatures of Small size or smaller can slip and wriggle through the wall at a rate of 10 feet per round. Mediumsize creatures can move through it with the Escape Artist skill-a successful check (DC 20) allows the creature to move 10 feet. A creature of any size that moves through the wall in this fashion takes 1d8 points of damage for every 10 feet traveled because of the sharp spikes and edges within the wall. The wall is 6 inches thick per caster level. Each 5-foot square has 10 hit points per 6 inches of thickness. The wall takes only half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 +2 per caster level. The wall is composed of bones of many different types of creatures, fused in bizarre angles. It cannot be animated by an animate dead spell, nor communicated with via speak with dead. Material Component: A withered peach branch taken from a cemetery.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Warning.MOD					DESC:Subject gets +4 to Listen and Spot and retains Dex bonus to AC when flat-footed.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Warning.MOD					DESC:This spell heightens the subject's senses and awareness of danger. The subject gains a +4 insight bonus on Listen and Spot checks and retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Water to Poison.MOD			DESC:Transform water into ingested poison.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Water to Poison.MOD			DESC:This spell transforms a volume of water into an equal volume of ingested poison. The saving throw DC of the poison is the same as the spell's DC would be (15 + your Intelligence modifier). The poison's initial damage is 1 point of temporary Constitution damage, and its secondary damage is 1d8 points of temporary Constitution damage. A single swallow of poison is enough to cause this effect, but drinking more does not increase the effect. Material Component: The fang of a poisonous snake.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weapon Bless.MOD				DESC:Prepare one weapon for combat against a particular foe.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weapon Bless.MOD				DESC:You prepare one weapon for combat against a particular foe. While casting the spell, you write the identity of the foe on the weapon, along with spirit invocations to give the weapon power. Although you do not need to know the exact name of the intended victim, you must still identify the creature specifically. You cannot, for example, bless a weapon for use against "a kappa," but you can bless it for use against "the kappa who lives in Ch'i Sheng's pond." The first time the blessed weapon is used against the target creature, its wielder gains a +5 enhancement bonus on the first attack roll and a +5 bonus on damage if the first attack is successful. After the first attack, or if the weapon is used against another foe before it is used against the target creature, the writings on the blade disappear and the spell effect ends. Focus: A writing brush and ink.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
When Two Become One.MOD			DESC:Your spirit merges with your horse's.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
When Two Become One.MOD			DESC:When you cast this spell, your spirit enters the body of your horse (which you must be riding when you cast the spell) and merges with the horse's own. Your own body hunkers low on the horse's back and holds on tight for the duration of the spell; it is a part of the body you and your steed share, but not a particularly useful part. As a joint creature, you and your mount share all your skills, feats, and abilities. You make all checks, saves, and attack rolls using the better base number (yours or your horse's) and the better ability score modifier. You retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, memory, personality, level and class, alignment, and extraordinary and supernatural abilities. You gain your horse's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, speed, natural armor and weapons, and extraordinary abilities. Opponents can attack either your body or your mount's. Your body uses the mount's Dexterity bonus to AC, not subject to the maximum Dexterity bonus for your armor type, with your own size modifier, armor bonus, and magical bonuses. Your mount's body uses its own Dexterity bonus, size modifier, armor bonus, natural armor bonus, and any magical bonuses derived from items on your body other than armor (such as an amulet of natural armor or ring of protection). You and your mount share a pool of hit points equal to your combined total hit points. When an opponent hits either your body or your mount's, the damage is subtracted from this combined pool. Neither you nor your mount becomes disabled or dying until all these combined hit points are exhausted. When the spell ends, you divide the hit points remaining in the pool as you choose between you and your mount.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Whip.MOD					DESC:Creates force whip; crack to keep animals at bay, strike animals to frighten them, or wield like a whip.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Whip.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a whip formed of magical force; the spell also grants you the ability to wield this whip with proficiency. Simply cracking the whip creates a sonic, mindaffecting effect that keeps normal animals (not beasts, magical beasts, or vermin) at bay unless they succeed at a Will saving throw. Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell. If you succeed at a normal ranged attack with the whip against any normal animal, the target animal must succeed at a Will saving throw or become frightened. Frightened creatures suffer a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws, and flee from you as well as they can. If unable to flee, creatures may fight. You can use the whip in combat against other opponents as if it were a normal whip. Material Component: A small silk whip.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Withering Palm.MOD			DESC:Touch attack deals 1 point Str and 1 point Con damage per two caster levels.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Withering Palm.MOD			DESC:A touch from your hand can cause the target's body to weaken and wither. With a successful melee touch attack, you deal 1 point of temporary Strength damage and 1 point of temporary Constitution damage per two caster levels to the target. If you score a critical hit, the damage from the hit is actually permanent ability drain.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wood Rot.MOD				DESC:Wood item or plant creature rots and becomes worthless.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wood Rot.MOD				DESC:Any wood item or plant creature you touch becomes instantaneously rotted, decayed, and worthless, effectively destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3- foot radius (a large wooden door), a 3-foot-radius volume of the wood is rotten and destroyed. Wooden magic items are immune to this spell. You may employ wood rot in combat with a successful melee touch attack. Wood rot used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of Armor Class gained from wooden armor or shields (up to the maximum amount of protection the armor offered). Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the weapon. A wooden or wooden-hafted weapon that is hit is destroyed. Note: Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around. Against plant creatures, wood rot instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. Material Component: A live termite.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Words of the Kami.MOD			DESC:Kills, paralyzes, weakens, or dazes Tainted subjects.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Words of the Kami.MOD			DESC:To utter the holy words of the kami is to bring forth magic of awesome power. Creatures with the Shadowlands subtype or with a Taint score suffer the following ill effects: HD Effect 12 or more Deafened Less than 12 Blinded, deafened Less than 8 Paralyzed, blinded, deafened Less than 4 Killed, paralyzed, blinded, deafened The effects are cumulative. Deafened: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, automatically fails Listen checks, suffers a -4 penalty on initiative, and has a 20%% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal (V) component that it tries to cast. Blinded:The creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds. In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50%% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Creatures free of Taint and without the Shadowlands subtype, including the spellcaster, are deafened for 1d4 rounds, regardless of their Hit Dice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Yakamo's Anger.MOD			DESC:Blinds creatures within 10 ft.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Yakamo's Anger.MOD			DESC:This spell unleashes the anger of the sun deity in a blinding flash originating with you and expanding outward. Any creature within the area of the spell that can see you must make a saving throw or be temporarily blinded. The blindness lasts for 1 minute per caster level. In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded creature suffers a 50%% miss chance in combat (all opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, grants a +2 bonus on attackers' attack rolls (they are effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a -4 penalty on Search checks and most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks. Sightless creatures are not affected by Yakamo's anger.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Attacks with the yari of air are regular melee attacks. The yari deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). The yari is considered a +1 weapon for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
