Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Psion ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Psion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Psions are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, quarter staff, and shortspear. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor does not, however, interfere with the manifestation of powers.

Power Points/Day			KEY:Psion ~ Power Points/Day			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Psion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A psion's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 2-3: The Psion. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Intelligence score (see Table 2-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points). His race may also provide bonus power points per day, as may certain feats and items.																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Discipline				KEY:Psion ~ Discipline				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Psion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Every psion must decide at 1st level which psionic discipline he will specialize in. Choosing a discipline provides a psion with access to the class skills associated with that discipline (see above), as well as the powers restricted to that discipline. However, choosing a discipline also means that the psion cannot learn powers that are restricted to other disciplines. He can't even use such powers by employing psionic items. (See Psionic Disciplines, below, for a brief description of each discipline. Chapter 5 of this book contains a list of powers available to all psions and lists of powers restricted to certain disciplines.)																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Powers Known			KEY:Psion ~ Powers Known			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Psion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A psion begins play knowing three psion powers of your choice. Each time he achieves a new level, he unlocks the knowledge of new powers. Choose the powers known from the psion power list, or from the list of powers of your chosen discipline. You cannot choose powers from disciplines other than your chosen discipline. (Exception: The feats Expanded Knowledge, page 46, and Epic Expanded Knowledge, page 34, do allow a psion to learn powers from the lists of other disciplines or even other classes.) A psion can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than his manifester level. The number of times a psion can manifest powers in a day is limited only by his daily power points. For example, a 9th-level psion (with a total of 72 power points) could manifest a power costing 1 power point seventy-two times in one day, a power costing 9 power points eight times in one day, or any other combination of manifestations that does not exceed 72 power points in total. A psion simply knows his powers; they are ingrained in his mind. He does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though he must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all his spent power points. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against psion powers is 10 + the power's level + the psion's Intelligence modifier. For example, the saving throw against a 6th-level power has a DC of 16 + Int modifier.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Maximum Power Level Known	KEY:Psion ~ Maximum Power Level Known	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Psion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A psion begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As he attains higher levels, a psion may gain the ability to master more complex powers-for example, a 3rd-level psion can learn powers of 2nd level or lower, a 5th-level psion can learn powers of 3rd level or lower, and so on. To learn or manifest a power, a psion must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level. For example, a psion within an Intelligence score of 15 can manifest powers of 5th level or lower.																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Bonus Feats				KEY:Psion ~ Bonus Feats				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Psion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A psion gains a bonus feat at 1st level, 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. This feat must be a psionic feat, a metapsionic feat, or a psionic item creation feat. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gains every three levels (as given on Table 3-2: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits, page 22 of the Player's Handbook). A psion is not limited to psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats when choosing these other feats.

Mind Blade					KEY:Soulknife ~ Mind Blade					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:Mind_Blade_LVL|0	DEFINE:Mind_Blade_Enhancement_Bonus|0	DEFINE:TestMin|0	DEFINE:MinTest|0	DESC:As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in all ways (except visually) to a short sword of a size appropriate for its wielder. For instance, a Medium soulknife materializes a Medium mind blade that he can wield as a light weapon, and the blade deals 1d6 points of damage (crit 19-20/x2). Soulknives who are smaller or larger than Medium create mind blades identical to short swords appropriate for their size, with a corresponding change to the blade's damage (see Table 7-4 and Table 7-5 in the Player's Handbook). The wielder of a mind blade gains the usual benefits to his attack roll and damage roll from a high Strength bonus. The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10 and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade, it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A soulknife can use feats such as Power Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as if it were a normal weapon. He can also choose mind blade for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Specialization. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade. A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls (+2 at 8th level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at 16th level, and +5 at 20th level). Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a null psionics field), a soulknife can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, the soulknife maintains his mind blade for a number of rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes. As a move action on his turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his mind blade while he remains within the psionics negating effect.

ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Wild Talent																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Throw Mind Blade				KEY:Soulknife ~ Throw Mind Blade				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:A soul knife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet. Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike (see below) with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities (such as Knife to the Soul; see below).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Psychic Strike				KEY:Soulknife ~ Psychic Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:PsychicStrikeDice|0	DEFINE:PsychicStrikeLVL|0								DESC:As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack, the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mind-affecting effects.) A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action. Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it. At every four levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the extra damage from a soulknife's psychic strike increases as shown on Table 2-5.[+%1d8 damage]|PsychicStrikeDice																																																																																																																																																																																												BONUS:VAR|PsychicStrikeDice|PsychicStrikeLVL/4	BONUS:VAR|PsychicStrikeLVL|SoulknifeLVL+1														SOURCEPAGE:p.28	ASPECT:NAME|Psychic Strike +%1d8|PsychicStrikeDice
Free Draw					KEY:Soulknife ~ Free Draw					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:At 5th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however (if, for example, he must make a Will save to materialize it within a null psionics field).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Shape Mind Blade				KEY:Soulknife ~ Shape Mind Blade				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to change the form of his mind blade. As a fullround action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (damage 1d8 for a Medium weapon wielded as a one-handed weapon) or a bastard sword (damage 1d10 for a Medium weapon, but he must wield it as a two-handed weapon unless he knows the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bastard sword) feat). If a soulknife shapes his mind blade into the form of a bastard sword and wields it two-handed, he adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus to his damage rolls, just like when using any other twohanded weapon. Alternatively, a soulknife can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with a weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.) However, both mind blades have an enhancement bonus 1 lower than the soulknife would otherwise create with a single mind blade. For example, a 12th-level soulknife normally creates a single +3 mind blade, but he could use this ability to instead materialize two +2 mind blades.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Mind Blade Enhancement			KEY:Soulknife ~ Mind Blade Enhancement			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:Mind_Blade_Enhancement_Value|0											DESC:At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add any one of the weapon special abilities on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value of +1. At every four levels beyond 6th (10th, 14th, and 18th), the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his weapon improves to +2, +3, and +4, respectively. A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level. For example, an 18th-level soulknife could add two +2 weapon special abilities, or one +1 weapon ability and one +3 weapon ability. The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decides to reassign its abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities. A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend 8 hours in concentration. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected by the soulknife. For example, a 10th-level soulknife might have initially chosen to imbue his weapon with psychokinetic burst, a +2 weapon special ability. Every time he materializes the weapon, it is a +2 psychokinetic burst mind blade. However, on learning that he may face a mind flayer the next day, he could take 8 hours to change his mind blade's special ability from psychokinetic burst to mindcrusher.[Current Enhancement Value +%1]|Mind_Blade_Enhancement_Value																																																																																																																																										BONUS:VAR|Mind_Blade_Enhancement_Value|Mind_Blade_LVL-2/4																			SOURCEPAGE:p.28	ASPECT:NAME|Mind Blade Enhancement +%1|Mind_Blade_Enhancement_Value
Speed of Thought				KEY:Soulknife ~ Speed of Thought				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:A soulknife gains Speed of Thought as a bonus feat at 6th level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Speed of Thought																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Bladewind					KEY:Soulknife ~ Bladewind					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:At 9th level, a soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent. As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade. (For example, if the mind blade were in the form of a +1 keen bastard sword, due to the soulknife's mind blade enhancement and shape mind blade abilities, each fragment attacks and deals damage as a +1 keen bastard sword.) When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the haste spell). The mind blade immediately reverts to its previous form after the bladewind attack.

ABILITY:FEAT|AUTOMATIC|Greater Weapon Focus (Mind Blade)																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Knife to the Soul				KEY:Soulknife ~ Knife to the Soul				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Beginning at 13th level, when a soulknife executes a psychic strike, he can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage (his choice) for extra dice of damage. For each die of extra damage he gives up, he deals 1 point of damage to the ability score he chooses. A soulknife can combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination, so a 19th-level soulknife could choose to strike for 3 points of Charisma damage and an extra 2d6 points of damage. The soulknife decides which ability score his psychic strike damages and the division of ability damage and extra dice of damage when he imbues his mind blade with the psychic strike energy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Multiple Throw				KEY:Soulknife ~ Multiple Throw				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Soulknife Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:At 17th level and higher, a soulknife can throw a number of mind blades per round equal to the number of melee attacks he could make. Thus, a 17th-level soulknife could throw two mind blades, with a base attack bonus of +12/+7. If he had used shape mind blade to materialize a mind blade for each hand and thus fight with two weapons, he could throw four mind blades in a round.

Any creature that attempts to eat the slayer's brain must succeed on a Will save (DC 15 + slayer's class level) or become disinclined to do so for 24 hours thereafter. A creature that fails this save may take any action it desires except extracting the slayer's brain (but does not realize it is being so affected).

This ability is active even if the illithid slayer is unconscious, stunned, or otherwise helpless.
Cerebral Blind			KEY:Illithid Slayer ~ Cerebral Blind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Illithid Slayer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES						DESC:Protection from location detection as long as psionically focused.	DESC: After reaching 6th level, an illithid slayer is protected from all devices, powers, and spells that reveal location. This ability protects against information gathering by clairsentience powers or effects that reveal location. The ability even foils bend reality, limited wish, miracle, reality revision, and wish when they are used to gain information about the slayer's location (however, metafaculty can pierce this protective barrier). In the case of remote viewing or scrying that scans an area an illithid slayer is in, the effect works, but the slayer simply isn't detected. Remote viewing or scrying attempts that are targeted specifi cally at an illithid slayer do not work. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.

Each successful melee attack (or ranged attack if the target is within 30 feet) she makes with her weapon against a creature with power resistance temporarily reduces its power resistance by 1. Unless the creature is slain, its lost power resistance returns all at once 12 hours later. This ability is active as long as the slayer is psionically focused.
Cerebral Immunity			KEY:Illithid Slayer ~ Cerebral Immunity			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Illithid Slayer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Immunity	VISIBLE:YES						DESC:Immune to mind influencing effects as long as psionically focused.	DESC: On reaching 9th level, an illithid slayer gains protection from all devices, powers, and spells that influence the mind. This ability shields her against almost all mind-affecting powers and effects (though the slayer can selectively allow powers or spells to affect her). The ability even foils bend reality, limited wish, miracle, reality revision, and wish when they are used to mentally infl uence an illithid slayer. This ability is active as long as the illithid slayer is psionically focused.
Blast Feedback			KEY:Illithid Slayer ~ Blast Feedback			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Illithid Slayer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES						DESC:At 10th level, an illithid slayer becomes able to turn an illithid's favorite attack against itself. If a slayer makes her saving throw when attacked with mind blast, the mind blast rebounds upon the attacker! Only the original attacker is targeted in the rebound effect. If the original attacker fails a Will saving throw (DC equal to that of the original attack), the attacker is affected normally by the mind blast.

The spirit of the ideal body transforms a war mind, granting him damage reduction 1/-. At 6th level, his damage reduction improves to 2/-. At 9th level, his damage reduction improves to 3/-.		DR:1/-
Sweeping Strike			KEY:War Mind ~ Sweeping Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:War Mind Class Feature.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES						DESC:At 5th level, a war mind gains the ability to make great, sweeping swings with a melee weapon. On each melee attack a war mind makes, he can choose squares he threatens that are adjacent to each other, and his attacks apply to creatures in those two squares equally. A war mind can use this ability on any attack, even an attack of opportunity or a cleave attempt. A war mind cannot use this ability if he has moved more than 10 feet since the end of his last turn. If a war mind drops one or both of his foes with a sweeping strike, he can attempt a cleave normally; however, he makes only one cleave attempt per sweeping strike, even if he drops more than one foe.
Chain of Overwhelming Force	KEY:War Mind ~ Chain of Overwhelming Force	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:War Mind Class Feature.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES						DESC:At 10th level, a war mind learns the fourth principle of warfare for the individual combatant: to discover the underlying violence of the world and deliver it in a perfectly executed attack. The Talariic texts describe precisely the state of mind necessary to tap into this underlying energy and apply it to a single attack, dealing an extra 10d6 points of damage. A war mind can use this power once per day. Activating this power is a free action. If the attack misses, the power is wasted.

Psi-Like Ability				KEY:Psi-Like Ability ~ Dromite		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Dromite Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:1/day-energy ray. A dromite always deals the kind of energy damage that its chitin has resistance to (for example, a dromite who has resistance to cold 5 deals cold damage with its energy ray).

A dromite can detect opponents by scent within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When a dromite detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not re vealed-only its presence somewhere within range. The dromite can take a move action to note the direction of the scent.

Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A gray dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a duergar can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can.

A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remai those of a creature of his actual size.

###Block: Psionic Companion Modifier Abilities
# Ability Name		Unique Key			Category of Ability		Type						Visible	Description
Channel Power						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner can manifest powers through the psicrystal to a distance of up to 1 mile. The psicrystal is treated as the power's originator, and all ranges are calculated from its location. When channeling a power through his psicrystal, the owner manifests the power by paying its power point cost. He is still subject to attacks of opportunity and other hazards of manifesting a power, if applicable (for instance, he becomes visible when manifesting an offensive power if invisible, as does the psicrystal).
Deliver Touch Powers					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner can have his psicrystal can deliver touch powers for him. If the owner and psicrystal are in contact at the time the owner manifests a touch power, he can designate his psicrystal as the "toucher." The psicrystal can then deliver the touch power just as the owner could. As usual, if the owner manifests another power before the touch is delivered, the touch power dissipates.
Hardness 8							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			VISIBLE:YES
Power Resistance						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The psicrystal gains power resistance equal to the owner's level + 5. To affect the psicrystal with a power, another manifester must get a result on a manifester level check that equals or exceeds the psicrystal's power resistance.
Self-Propulsion		KEY:Self Propulsion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:As a standard action, its owner can will a psicrystal to form spidery, ectoplasmic legs that grant the psicrystal a land speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 20 feet. The legs fade into nothingness after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
Flight			KEY:Flight ~ Psicrystal	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner can, as a standard action, will his psicrystal to fly at a speed of 50 feet (poor). The psicrystal drifts gently to the ground after one day (or sooner, if the owner desires).
Share Powers						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:At the owner's option, he can have any power (but not any psi-like ability) he manifests on himself also affect his psicrystal. The psicrystal must be within 5 feet of him at the time of the manifestation to receive the benefit. If the power has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the psicrystal if it moves farther than 5 feet away, and will not affect the psicrystal again, even if it returns to its owner before the duration expires. Additionally, the owner can manifest a power with a target of "You" on his psicrystal (as a touch range power) instead of on himself. The owner and psicrystal cannot share powers if the powers normally do not affect creatures of the psicrystal's type (construct).
Sight Link							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The character can remote view the psicrystal (as if manifesting the remote view power) once per day.
Telepathic Link						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The owner has a telepathic link with his psicrystal out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The owner cannot see through the psicrystal's senses, but the two of them can communicate telepathically as if the psicrystal were the target of a mindlink power manifested by the owner. For instance, a psicrystal placed in a distant room could relay the activities occurring in that room. Because of the telepathic link between a psicrystal and its owner, the owner has the same connection to an item or place that the psicrystal does. For instance, if his psicrystal has seen a room, the owner can teleport into that room as if he has seen it too.
Telepathic Speech						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:The psicrystal can communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language and is within 30 feet of the psicrystal, while the psicrystal is also within 1 mile of the owner.

# Psicrystal
Sighted							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:Although it has no physical sensory organs, a psicrystal can telepathically sense its environment as well as a creature with normal vision and hearing. Darkness (even supernatural darkness) is irrelevant, as are areas of supernatural silence, though a psicrystal still can't discern invisible or ethereal beings. A psicrystal's sighted range is 40 feet.
