Breath Barrier				KEY:Expanded Knowledge Power ~ Breath Barrier				CATEGORY:Internal		TYPE:ExpandedKnowledgeFeat	PREVARGTEQ:ExpandedKnowledgeLVL,3	SPELLKNOWN:CLASS|SPELLCASTER.Psionic=3|Breath Barrier				SOURCEPAGE:p.120	DESC:You create a quasi-real barrier in the shape of a sphere that shimmers with golden sparkles and moves with you. Creatures and objects can enter or leave the area unimpeded. A breath barrier blocks fog, foglike effects, and gases created by spells such as fog cloud or cloudkill or by breath weapons that are poison gas. When used as a barrier against breath weapons that deal hit point damage directly, the sphere absorbs up to 60 points of damage from one or more breath weapons before collapsing (at which time the power ends). A breath barrier takes damage as though it were a creature that failed its saving throw against the breath weapon being used. Augment: For every 2 additional power points you spend, the barrier can absorb an additional 12 points of breath weapon damage before collapsing.

When you manifest this power in conjunction with making a successful Reflex save against a breath attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath), you instead take no damage. Augment: If you spend 4 additional power points, you take only half damage on a failed Reflex save.
