Aligned Attack					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic		!PREALIGN:TN		MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|Internal|QUALIFIED[TYPE=Aligned_Attack]																												PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:Your melee or ranged attack overcomes your opponent's alignment-based damage reduction and deals an additional 1d6 damage, using your psionic focus.																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.41	PRETOTALAB:6	BENEFIT:When you take this feat, choose either chaos, good, evil or law. (Your choice must match one of your alignment components; for example, if you are lawful good, you can choose either lawful or good, but not chaotic or evil). Once you've made this alignment choice, it cannot be changed. To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). When you make a successful melee or ranged attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, and your attack is treated as either a good, evil, chaotic, or lawful attack (depending on your original choice) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.
Antipsionic Magic					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=5											!PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:Your spells are more potent when used against psionic characters and creatures.																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.41				BENEFIT:You get a get a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome a psionic creature's power resistance. This bonus stacks with the bonus conferred by Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration. Moreover, whenever a psionic creature attempts to dispel a spell you cast, it makes its manifester level check against a DC of 13 + its manifester level. The benefits of this feat apply only to power resistance. The bonus does not apply to spell resistance. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule (see page 55). Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
Autonomous						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																															DESC:You have a knack for psionic self-sufficiency.																																																																																				BONUS:SKILL|Autohypnosis,Knowledge (Psionics)|2																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.41				BENEFIT:You get a +2 bonus on all Autohypnosis checks and Knowledge (psionics) checks.
Body Fuel						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can expand your power point total at the expense of your health.																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41				BENEFIT:You can recover 2 power points by taking 1 point of ability burn damage (see page 67) to each of your three ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. You can recover additional power points for a proportional cost; for example, you could choose to recover 6 power points by taking 3 points of ability burn damage to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These recovered points are added to your power point reserve as if you had gained them by resting overnight. Special: Only living creatures can use this feat. You can take advantage of this feat only while in your own body (if you are under the effect of mind switch or metamorph, for example, you gain no benefit).
Boost Construct					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:Your astral constructs have more abilities.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.43				BENEFIT:When you create an astral construct, you can give it one additional special ability from any menu (see page 186) that the construct currently has an ability from.
Burrowing Power					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:Your powers sometimes bypass barriers.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.43				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can attempt to manifest your powers against targets that are sheltered behind a wall or force effect. Your power briefly skips through the Astral Plane to bypass the barrier. The strength and thickness of the barrier determine your chance of success. To successfully bypass the barrier with your power, you make a Psicraft check against a DC equal to 10 + the hardness of the barrier + 1 per foot of thickness (minimum 1). Assign a hardness of 20 to barriers without a hardness rating, such as force effects (or a wall of ectoplasm). Force walls or walls of ectoplasm are assumed to have less than 1 foot of thickness unless noted otherwise. If a power requires line of sight (which includes most powers that affect a target or targets instead of an area), you cannot manifest it as a burrowing power unless you can somehow see the target, such as with clairvoyant sense. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Chain Power						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can manifest powers that arc to hit other targets in addition to the primary target.																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can chain any power that affects a single target and that deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty). The secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (round down). Each target gets to make a saving throw, if one is allowed by the power. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example). Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Chaotic Mind					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREALIGN:CG,CN,CE																												PRESTAT:1,CHA=15					!PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:The turbulence of your thoughts prevents others from gaining insight into your actions.																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:Creatures and characters who have an insight bonus on their attack rolls, an insight bonus to their Armor Class, or an insight bonus on skill checks or ability checks do not gain those bonuses against you. The benefit of this feat applies only to insight bonuses gained from psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule (see page 55). Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
Cloak Dance						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PRESKILL:2,Hide=10,Perform (Dance)=2																DESC:You are skilled at using optical tricks to make yourself seem to be where you are not.																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:You can take a move action to obscure your exact position. Until your next turn, you have concealment. Alternatively, you can take a full-round action to entirely obscure your exact position. Until your next action, you have total concealment.
Closed Mind						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																							!PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:Your mind is better able to resist psionics than normal.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:You get a +2 bonus on all saving throws to resist powers. The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule (see page 55). Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
Combat Manifestation				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You are adept at manifesting powers in combat.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:You get a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability while on the defensive (see Manifesting Powers on the Defensive, page 54) or while you are grappling or pinned.
Craft Cognizance Crystal			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation									PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Psionic,3																					PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can create psionic cognizance crystals that store power points.																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:You can create a cognizance crystal. Doing so takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a cognizance crystal is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp. For example, a cognizance crystal that stores 5 power points could be used to manifest a power as high as 3rd level. Thus, its cost is 9,000 gp (3 x 3 x 1,000 = 9,000). To create a cognizance crystal, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing onehalf its base price.
Craft Dorje						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation									PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Psionic,5																					PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can create slender crystal wands called dorjes than manifest powers when charges are expended.																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:You can create a dorje of any psionic power you know (barring exceptions, such as bestow power, as noted in a power's description). Crafting a dorje takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a dorje is its manifester level x the power level x 750 gp. To craft a dorje, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price. A newly created dorje has 50 charges. Any dorje that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the XP cost derived from the base price, you must pay fifty times the XP cost.
Craft Psicrown					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation									PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Psionic,12																					PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can create psicrowns, which have multiple psionic effects.																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:You can create any psicrown whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a psicrown takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a psicrown, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. See page 169 for descriptions of psicrowns, the prerequisites associated with each one, and their prices. Some psicrowns incur extra costs in XP as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the psicrown's base price.
Craft Psionic Arms and Armor			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation									PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Psionic,5																					PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can create psionic weapons, armor, and shields.																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.44				BENEFIT:You can create any psionic weapon, armor, or shield whose prerequisites you meet. Enhancing a weapon, suit of armor, or shield takes one day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its psionic features. To enhance a weapon, you must spend 1/25 of its features' total price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this total price. See Chapter 7 for descriptions of psionic weapons, armor, and shields, the prerequisites associated with each, and the prices of their features. The weapon, armor, or shield to be enhanced must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a broken psionic weapon, suit of armor, or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to enhance that item in the first place.
Craft Psionic Construct				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation															PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Psionic Arms and Armor,Craft Universal Item											PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can create golems and other psionic automatons that obey your orders.																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.45				BENEFIT:You can create any psionic construct whose prerequisites you meet. Creating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To create a construct, you must spend 1/25 of the construct's base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this price (see the psion-killer description, page 208, for details). A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.
Craft Universal Item				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation									PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Psionic,3																					PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can create universal psionic items.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.45				BENEFIT:You can create any universal psionic item whose prerequisites you meet (see page 172 for prerequisites and other in formation on universal items). Crafting a universal psionic item takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a universal psionic item, you must spend 1/25 of the item's base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of this price. You can also mend a broken universal item if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the XP, half the raw materials, and half the time it would take to craft that item in the first place. Some universal items incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the item's base price. You must pay such a cost to create an item or to mend a broken one.
Deadly Precision					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																PRESTAT:1,DEX=15													DESC:You empty your mind of all distracting emotion, becoming an instrument of deadly precision.																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.45	PRETOTALAB:5	BENEFIT:You have deadly accuracy with your sneak attacks. You can reroll any result of 1 on your sneak attack's extra damage dice.

SOURCEPAGE:p.45	PRETOTALAB:5	BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can resolve your attack with a melee weapon as a touch attack. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack.

Delay Power						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can manifest powers that go off up to 5 rounds later.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.45				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can manifest a power as a delayed power. A delayed power doesn't activate immediately. When you manifest the power, you choose one of three trigger mechanisms: (1) The power activates when you take a standard action to activate it; (2) It activates when a creature enters the area that the power will affect (only powers that affect areas can use this trigger condition); or (3) It activates on your turn after 5 rounds pass. If you choose one of the first two triggers and the conditions are not met within 5 rounds, the power activates automatically on the fifth round. Only area and personal powers can be delayed. Any decisions you would make about the delayed power, including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area, are decided when the power is manifested. Any effects resolved by those affected by the power, including saving throws, are decided when the delay period ends. A delayed power can be dispelled normally during the delay, and can be detected normally in the area or on the target by the use of powers that can detect psionic effects. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Empower Power					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can manifest powers to greater effect.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.46				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can empower a power. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered power are increased by one-half. An empowered power deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Augmented powers can also be empowered (multiply 1-1/2 times the damage total of the augmented power). Saving throws and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you manifest dispel psionics) are not affected, nor are powers without random variables. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Enlarge Power					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can manifest powers farther than normal.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.46				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can alter a power with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%%. An enlarged power with a range of close has a range of 50 feet + 5 feet per level, a mediumrange powes has a range of 200 feet + 20 feet per level, and a long-range power has a range of 800 feet + 80 feet per level. Powers whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as powers whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, are not affected. Using this feat does not increase the power point cost of the power.

SOURCEPAGE:p.46	PRETOTALAB:3	BENEFIT:You must be psionically focused to use this feat. When you make a melee attack or a ranged attack aganst an incorporeal creature, you can make two rolls to check for the miss chance.

Special: A fighter may select this feat as one of his fighter bonus feats.

SOURCEPAGE:p.48				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can maximize a power.

Saving throws and opposed checks are not affected, nor are powers without random variables. Augmented powers can be maximized; a maximized augmented power deals the maximum damage (or cures the maximum hit points, and so on) of the augmented power.

The benefit of this feat applies only to psionic powers and psi-like abilities. This is an exception to the psionics-magic transparency rule (see page 55). Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
Metamorphic Transfer				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic									PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Psionic,5																		PRESTAT:1,WIS=13	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can gain a supernatural ability of a metamorphed form.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.48				BENEFIT:Each time you change your form, such as through the metamorphosis power, you gain one of the new form's supernatural abilities, if it has any. You gain only three uses of the metamorphic ability per day, even if the creature into which you metamorph has a higher limit on uses. For instance, if you gain a dragon's breath weapon, you can use that ability only three times before losing access to the ability for the day. (You are still subject to other restrictions on the use of the ability. For example, after you use a dragon's breath weapon, you can't use it again for 1d4 rounds.) The save DC to resist a supernatural ability gained through Metamorphic Transfer (if it is an attack) is 10 + your Cha modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice. Normal: You cannot use the supernatural abilities of creatures whose form you assume. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you can gain one additional supernatural ability.

SOURCEPAGE:p.48				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). When you make an attack of opportunity, you can use any power you know with a range of touch, if you have at least one hand free. Manifesting this power is an immediate action. You cannot use this feat with a touch power whose manifesting time is longer than 1 full-round action. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level. Normal: Attacks of opportunity can be made only with melee weapons.

At 8th level, you can choose to increase your effective manifester level by two, but you take 3d8 points of damage. At 15th level, you can increase your effective manifester level by three, but you take 5d8 points of damage. The effective increase in manifester level increases the number of power points you can expend on a single power manifestation, as well as increasing all manifester level-dependent effects, such as range, duration, and overcoming power resistance. Normal: Your manifester level is equal to your total levels in classes that manifest powers.
Power Penetration					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:Your powers are especially potent, breaking through power resistance more readily than normal.

#BENEFIT:This feat allows you to gain a psicrystal. See Psicrystals, page 21 and 207, for details on how psicrystals work. It is a telepathically linked construct that is an extension of your own personality, and can move (30' walk, 20' climb) and talk (one language, understands all that languages that you do), and see as if it had 40' normal vision even in supernatural darkness. The crystal can be improved with various personalities that give you bonuses

SOURCEPAGE:p.49				BENEFIT:You can spend a full-round action attempting to psionically focus your psicrystal (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you can expend your psicrystal's psionic focus instead, as long as the crystal is within 5 feet of you. Psionically focusing your psicrystal works just like focusing yourself. The psicrystal cannot focus itself-only the owner can spend the time to focus the crystal.

SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). When you charge, you can make one turn of up to 90 degrees during your movement. All other restrictions on charges still apply; for instance, you cannot pass through a square that blocks or slows movement, or that contains a creature. You must have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn.

SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:You must be psionically focused (see the Concentration skill description, page 37) to use this feat. You receive a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. This bonus stacks with the bonus from the Dodge feat (but only applies on attacks made by the opponent you have designated).

SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). Your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.
Psionic Hole					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																PRESTAT:1,CON=15					!PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic					DESC:You are anathema to psionic creatures and characters.																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:When a foe strikes you in melee combat, the foe immediately loses its psionic focus, if any. Also, if you are the target of a power, the manifester of the power must spend an additional number of power points equal to your Wisdom bonus, or the power fails (all the power points spent on the power are still lost). This extra cost does not count toward the maximum power points a manifester can spend on a single power. Special: You cannot take or use this feat if you have the ability to use powers (if you have a power point reserve or psi-like abilities).
Psionic Meditation				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																									PRESKILL:1,Concentration=7			PRESTAT:1,WIS=13	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can focus your mind faster than normal, even under duress.																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:You can take a move action to become psionically focused (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). Normal: A character without this feat must take a fullround action to become psionically focused.

SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). Your ranged attack deals +2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). Your attack with a melee weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.	ASPECT:CombatBonus|+2d6 damage to one attack (expend Psionic focus before attack).
Quicken Power					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can manifest a power with a moment's thought.																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can quicken a power. You can perform another action, even manifest another power, in the same round that you manifest a quickened power. You can manifest only one quickened power per round. A power whose manifesting time is longer than 1 round cannot be quickened. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level. Manifesting a quickened power does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Rapid Metabolism					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																PRESTAT:1,CON=13	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:Your wounds heal rapidly.																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.50				BENEFIT:You naturally heal a number of hit points per day equal to the standard healing rate + double your Constitution bonus. You heal even if you do not rest. This healing replaces your normal natural healing. If you are tended successfully by someone with the Heal skill, you instead regain double the normal amount of hit points + double your Constitution bonus.
Reckless Offense					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																															DESC:You can shift your focus from defense to offense.																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.51	PRETOTALAB:1	BENEFIT:When you use the attack action or full attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of -4 to your Armor Class and add a +2 bonus on your melee attack roll. The bonus on attack rolls and penalty to Armor Class last until the beginning of your next turn.
Return Shot						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic															PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Fell Shot,Point Blank Shot,Psionic Shot												PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can return incoming arrows, as well as crossbow bolts, spears, and other projectile or thrown weapons.																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.51	PRETOTALAB:3	BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37) and have at least one hand free. Once per round when you would normally be hit by a projectile or a thrown weapon no more than one size category larger than your size, you can deflect the attack so that you take no damage from it. The attack is deflected back at your attacker, using the attack bonus of the original attack on you. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to return a shot is a free action. Special: If you also have the Deflect Arrows feat (see page 93 of the Player's Handbook), the deflected attack is made with the original attack bonus plus your Dexterity bonus.
Scribe Tattoo					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation									PREVARGTEQ:Caster_Level_Highest__Psionic,3																					PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can create psionic tattoos, which store powers within their designs.																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.51				BENEFIT:You can create a psionic tattoo of any power of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Scribing a psionic tattoo takes one day. When you create a psionic tattoo, you set the manifester level. The manifester level must be sufficient to manifest the power in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a psionic tattoo is its power level x its manifester level x 50 gp. To scribe a tattoo, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials (special inks, masterwork needles, and so on) costing one-half of this base price. When you create a psionic tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when manifesting the power. When its wearer physically activates the tattoo, the wearer is the target of the power. Any psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must pay the XP when creating the tattoo.
Sidestep Charge					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge															PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You are skilled at dodging past charging opponents and taking advantage when they miss.																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.51				BENEFIT:You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against charge attacks. If a charging opponent fails to make a successful attack against you, you gain an immediate attack of opportunity. This feat does not grant you more attacks of opportunity than you are normally allowed in a round. If you are flat-footed or otherwise denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, you do not gain the benefit of this feat.
Speed of Thought					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																PRESTAT:1,WIS=13	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:The energy of your mind energizes the alacrity of your body.																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.51				BENEFIT:As long as you are psionically focused and not wearing heavy armor, you gain an insight bonus to your speed of 10 feet.
Split Psionic Ray					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metapsionic																PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can affect two targets with a single ray.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.51				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can split psionic rays you manifest. The split ray affects any two targets that are both within the power's range and within 30 feet of each other. If the ray deals damage, each target takes as much damage as a single target would take. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.
Stand Still						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																PRESTAT:1,STR=13													DESC:You can prevent foes from fleeing or closing.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.51				BENEFIT:When a foe's movement out of a square you threaten grants you an attack of opportunity, you can give up that attack and instead attempt to stop your foe in his tracks. Make your attack of opportunity normally. If you hit your foe, he must succeed on a Reflex save against a DC of 10 + your damage roll (the opponent does not actually take damage), or immediately halt as if he had used up his move actions for the round. Since you use the Stand Still feat in place of your attack of opportunity, you can do so only a number of times per round equal to the number of times per round you could make an attack of opportunity (normally just one). Normal: Attacks of opportunity cannot halt your foes in their tracks.
Talented						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Overchannel																	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can overchannel powers with less cost to yourself.																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.51				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). When manifesting a power of 3rd level or lower, you do not take damage from overchanneling.
Twin Power						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can manifest a power simultaneously with another power just like it.																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.51				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both of the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect). Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 6. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Unavoidable Strike				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Psionic Fist														PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can make an unarmed strike or use a natural weapon against your foe as if delivering a touch attack.																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.52	PRETOTALAB:5	BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can resolve your unarmed strike or attack with a natural weapon as a touch attack. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.
Unconditional Power				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:Disabling conditions do not hold you back.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.52				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). Your mental strength is enough to overcome some otherwise disabling conditions. You can manifest an unconditional power when you are dazed, confused, nauseated, shaken, or stunned. Only personal powers and powers that affect your person can be manifested as unconditional powers. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 8. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Up the Walls					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																PRESTAT:1,WIS=13	PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can run on walls for brief distances.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.52				BENEFIT:While you are psionically focused, you can take part of one of your move actions to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth vertical surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited only by this movement restriction. If you do not end your move on a horizontal surface, you fall prone, taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above the ground. Treat the wall as a normal floor for the purpose of measuring your movement. Passing from floor to wall or wall to floor costs no movement; you can change surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks of opportunity as you move up the wall. For instance, Ma'varkith the psychic warrior has a speed of 40 feet (due to her Speed of Thought feat). She begins her turn standing next to a wall. She moves up the wall at a 45-degree angle ("diagonally") for 20 feet, which puts her 15 feet farther along the wall and 15 feet above the ground. Then she moves 15 feet straight down, ending her move in a 5-foot square adjacent to the wall (she has used up 35 feet of her allowed movement). At this point she takes her attack normally against an opponent adjacent to her, which potentially sets up flanking opportunities for her comrades. If the wall had a ledge within 30 feet of the ground, she could have ended her move on the ledge instead of having to move back down to the floor. Special: You can take other move actions in conjunction with moving along a wall. For instance, the Spring Attack feat allows you to make an attack from the wall against a foe standing on the ground who is within the area you threaten; however, if you are somehow prevented from completing your move, you fall. Likewise, you could tumble along the wall to avoid attacks of opportunity.
Widen Power						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:You can increase the area of your powers.																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.52				BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped power to increase its area. (Powers that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.) Any numeric measurements of the power's area increase by 100%%. For example, an energy burst power (which normally produces a 40-foot-radius spread) that is widened now fills an 80-footradius spread. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 4. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Wild Talent						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																															DESC:Your mind wakes to a previously unrealized talent for psionics.																																																		TEMPLATE:Psionic																																											BONUS:VAR|BasePowerPoints|2																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.52				BENEFIT:Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by virtue of having this feat.
Wounding Attack					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																			PRETEMPLATE:1,Psionic									DESC:Your vicious attacks wound your foe.																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.52	PRETOTALAB:8	BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus (see the Concentration skill description, page 37). You can make an attack with such vicious force that you wound your opponent. A wound deals 1 point of Constitution damage to your foe in addition to the usual damage dealt. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.34				BENEFIT:When you expend your psionic focus, you can simultaneously use two feats that require a psionic focus to be expended, instead of just one. The feats must be stackable (for instance, Burrowing Power and Extend Power could both be used together on the same power). You must still spend the requisite power points required to use each metapsionic feat, and you cannot exceed the power point limit set by our manifester level. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you can simultaneously use one additional feat that requires a psionic focus to be expended.

This feat has no effect on metapsionic powers that inflate the cost by only 2 power points. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. The ffects stack, though you can't lower the cost of any metapsionic power to less than 1 power point.
