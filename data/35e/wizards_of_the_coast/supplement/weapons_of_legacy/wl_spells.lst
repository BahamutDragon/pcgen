You regain one daily use of the chosen ability. This use must be expended within the spell's duration, or it is lost. If all daily uses of all least legacy abilities of the item are still available, this spell has no effect (that is, it can't increase the number of available daily uses above the normal maximum). No legacy item can be affected by this spell more than once in a 24-hour period. Focus: Your legacy item, which you must be holding, wearing, or wielding.

Sever Legacy	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Sorcerer,wizard,wu jen=8	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You permanently disrupt the bond between the target creature and its legacy item (or items). The target is treated as if it had not performed any of the legacy rituals for its item or items. It loses all of the following feats it has gained for all of its legacy items: Greater Legacy, Least Legacy, Lesser Legacy. If the target's Hit Dice total exceeds your caster level, the target adds the difference as a bonus on its Will save to negate the effect. Any creature that successfully saves against this spell cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. The target does not regain any of the personal costs paid to gain access to legacy abilities. It can regain access to its item's legacy abilities by performing the requisite rituals again. In this case, it does not pay again any personal costs that it has already paid. Other than by again performing the legacy rituals to regain lost feats, the effect of this spell can be negated only by miracle or wish.
Suppress Legacy	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Hexblade=4|sorcerer,wizard,wu jen=5	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 round	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One creature	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You temporarily disrupt the bond between the target creature and a single legacy item it possesses. The target loses access to all legacy abilities granted by that item. For the duration of the spell, it cannot activate any of the item's legacy abilities, nor do any continuous effects of the legacy item grant any benefit to the target. If the target has more than one legacy item, determine randomly which one is affected. This effect cannot be dispelled, but it can be negated by break enchantment, remove curse, or any other effect that removes a curse.
