# Unable to implement the Class Features - Need to discuss with Andrew M. and see what solution he comes up with.

# Proposed fix: Only implement class level 1 and 7 of Legacy champion and let players advance their original classes for the remaining levels.
#               The actual class Level of the Legacy champion is tracked via an ability adjusting an internal variable that the player needs to update manually after each levelup.
#               Class features are granted based on that LegacyChampionLVL variable.
#               Any deviation from the class progression in BAB, Saves, HP and Skillpoints can be adjusted by the player with a provided set of abilities, similar to the Personal Cost of Legacy items or GM Awards.
#               Support for ability Replacements need to be integrated in every legacy item. 
#                 Before granting an ability, each item needs to check if that ability has been selected by one of the three replacement abilities. If it was, the ability is just not granted.
#                 Replacement abilities are then selected via an ability pool.
