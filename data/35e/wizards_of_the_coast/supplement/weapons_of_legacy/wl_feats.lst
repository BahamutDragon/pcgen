DESC:You can call upon the hidden strength within your legacy item to empower yourself for a single spectacular effort.

As an immediate action (see the sidebar on page 15), you can expend all the daily uses of that ability to grant yourself a bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn and depends on the power of the legacy ability, as shown in the following table. Legacy Ability Expended Bonus Least +2 Lesser +4 Greater +6 All daily uses of the legacy ability are expended without their normal effect. You choose the ability when you use this feat. Special: You cannot use this feat to expend any legacy ability that does not have its full daily complement of uses remaining. For example, if a legacy ability is usable three times per day, all three daily uses must be available to use this feat.
Curative Legacy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Legacy	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with a daily use limit, ability to cast cure light wounds.

Each time you activate the chosen ability, you regain hit points as though a cure spell were cast on you. You cannot gain more hit points than your full normal total. The amount of damage healed depends on the power of the ability, as shown in the following table.

Three times per day, you can choose to increase by one-half all variable, numeric effects of that ability (as the Empower Spell feat). Special: You can gain Empower Legacy multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.

Master Legacy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Legacy	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Channel Legacy, Least Legacy, Use Magic Device 4 ranks.												DESC:You temporarily gain access to legacy abilities beyond your normal reach.							SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:Once per day as a free action, you can treat your character level as if it were one higher for determining which legacy abilities you can use. You do not pay any new personal costs associated with the increased level, but you cannot access any abilities for which you have not met the prerequisites. For example, a 10th-level character gains no benefit from this feat, since she has not yet gained the Lesser Legacy feat required to use legacy abilities of 11th level or higher. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you activate a legacy ability with a daily use limit, whichever comes first.
Quicken Legacy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Legacy	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Least Legacy, spell-like or command activated legacy ability.

SOURCEPAGE:p.15	BENEFIT:When you select this feat, choose one available spell-like legacy ability of a specific item, or one whose effect is triggered by a command word. Three times per day, you can trigger that power as a swift action, as the Quicken Spell feat (see the definition of swift actions in the sidebar below). Special: You can gain Quicken Legacy multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new legacy ability.
Transfer Legacy	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Legacy	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Least Legacy, legacy ability with a daily use limit.													DESC:You can temporarily transfer one of your legacy item's abilities to another magic item.					SOURCEPAGE:p.16	BENEFIT:Choose one of your item's available legacy abilities with a daily use limit. Once per day, you can transfer that ability from your legacy item to another magic item. This transfer requires you to touch the legacy item to the recipient magic item (a standard action). For the next 24 hours, you cannot activate the transferred ability. However, the wielder of the recipient magic item can activate the transferred ability as the legacy item's wielder, for as many uses as remain in the day. The recipient wielder need not meet any prerequisites for activating or using the donor legacy item. Special: You cannot transfer a legacy ability that does not have at least one daily use remaining. You choose the ability when you use this feat. If you have the Lesser Legacy feat, you can use this ability two times per day. If you have the Greater Legacy feat, you can use this ability three times per day. Each time you do so, you must choose a different ability.
