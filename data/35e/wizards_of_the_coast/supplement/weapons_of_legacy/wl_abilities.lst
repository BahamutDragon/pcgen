# Here are my thought processes on making sure all prerequisits of a legacy item are checked while still keeping the system flexible
# Each legacy item gets an internal ability by its own name and defines (at least) 3 variables: XYZWielderQualified, XYZProgressionLVL and XYZCostLevel
#   XYZWielderQualified is 1 if the character fulfills all Wielder Requirements of the weapon and in fact has the weapon in his inventory the weapon, 0 otherwise
#   XYZCostLVL is the highest legacy ability a character could receive with his currently paid personal costs. 
#     XYZCostLVL is increased by selecting abilities from the "XYZ Personal Costs" ability pool.
#       Points in this pool are gained whenever the character reaches a level with costs and has the corresponding Legacy Feat.
#       Cost abilities require the previous ability to be taken, so penalties are applied in order and can't be skipped (though players can remove penalties in the middle of the chain to break this)
#     Personal Cost abilities check for level and Legacy feat requirements. Once they are selected from the pool they add their penalty and increase the XYZCostLVL by 1 + the number of lines that don't have a personal cost (this can increase XYZCostLVL to a level higher than the current CLVL)
#   XYZProgressionLVL should always contain the highest level bonus a character has unlocked for the item, which is the minimum of the character's classlevels and XYZCostLVL (if XYZWielderQualified is 1)
#     The actual legacy abilities of the item can now be added by based on the XYZProgressionLVL variable
#     Abilities gained at exactly level 11 and 16 need check for the Lesser and Greater Feats, to support the Master Legacy Feat later on. (i.e. Master Legacy will grant a TEMPBONUS to increase XYZCostLVL and XYZProgressionLVL by 1)
# Additionally, XYZEnhancementBonus is used to track Weapon/Armor enhancement boni granted a different levels. The variable is then combined with checks for replacement abilities to calculate XYZTotalEnhancement for use in the item entry.
