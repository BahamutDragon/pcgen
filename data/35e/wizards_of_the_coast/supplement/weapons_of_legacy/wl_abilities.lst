# Legacy Champion
# Ability Name			Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type														Description																																																																																																																																																											Source Page
Class Features			KEY:Legacy Champion ~ Class Features		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Features.Legacy Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At each level except 1st and 7th, you gain class features and an increase in effective level as if you had also gained a level in a class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. The specific class features you gain include spells per day (and spells known, if applicable), improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, bonus feats, monk special abilities, sneak attack progressions, and so on, depending on the class. You do not, however, gain the benefit of your previous class's Hit Dice, attack progression, skill points, or saving throws. If you had more than one class before becoming a legacy champion, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining class abilities.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Reduced Ritual Cost		KEY:Legacy Champion ~ Reduced Ritual Cost		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Features.Legacy Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:After you've made a successful Knowledge (history) check to learn the lesser legacy ritual for your legacy item, you can perform that ritual and gain the Lesser Legacy feat as normal. However, you do not pay the ritual's associated gp cost. You must still perform all other aspects of the ritual and pay any personal costs required to unlock lesser abilities. If you have more than one legacy item, you must decide to which one this reduction applies. On reaching 7th level, you can perform the greater legacy ritual for your item without paying the associated gp cost.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.20

Replace Legacy Ability		KEY:Legacy Champion ~ Replace Legacy Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Features.Legacy Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As your bond with your legacy item strengthens, you become capable of permanently changing the item's abilities to suit your needs. At 2nd level, you can replace any one least ability granted by your item with your choice of any least ability from Menu A in Chapter 4: Founding Legacies. At 5th level, you can replace any one least or lesser ability with your choice of any least ability from Menu A or any lesser ability from Menu D, respectively. At 10th level, you can replace any one least, lesser, or greater ability with your choice of any least ability from Menu A, any lesser ability from Menu D, or any greater ability from Menu G, respectively.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Extra Legacy Ability Use	KEY:Legacy Champion ~ Extra Legacy Ability Use	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Features.Legacy Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:As your bond with your legacy item strengthens, you can draw on its abilities more often than normal. At 3rd level, choose one of your item's least abilities with a daily use limit. You can use that ability one extra time per day. Once you have chosen an ability, you cannot change it later. At 6th level, you can also gain an extra daily use of one of your item's lesser abilities. At 9th level, you can also gain an extra daily use of one of your item's greater abilities. You can instead choose to gain an extra daily use of a lower ability (for example, choosing a second least ability instead of a lesser ability at 6th level), but you can't gain more than one extra daily use of a given ability. If your item has no legacy abilities with a daily use limit, you gain no benefit from this class feature. If you later gain access to an eligible legacy ability, you can immediately choose that ability for an extra daily use.	SOURCEPAGE:p.20

# This ability checks for prerequisites and grants the apropriate legacy weapon abilities.
#   The personal cost ability is ADDed, since costs are persistent even if Legacy Feats are lost.
#   BloodcrierProgressionLVL tracks the highest level of unlocked abilities, and can possibly be manipulated by feats and class features at some point. 
#   It could also be extended by a check for the presence of the personal cost ability?
