Auras					KEY:Marshal ~ Auras					SORTKEY:Class Marshal	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Marshal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.12	DESC:The marshal exerts an effect on allies in his vicinity. He can learn to produce different effects, or auras, over the course of his career. The marshal may project one minor aura and (starting at 2nd level) one major aura at a time. Projecting an aura is a swift action (see Chapter 2: Magic). The aura remains in effect until the marshal uses a free action to dismiss it or activates another aura of the same kind (major or minor). A marshal can have an aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before the marshal takes his first turn. Activating an aura involves haranguing, ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling, or calming allies. A marshal sizes up the enemy, allies, and the terrain, then gives allies the direction that they can use to do their best. Unless otherwise noted, a marshal's aura affects all allies within 60 feet (including himself ) who can hear the marshal. An ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and be able to understand the marshal's language to gain the bonus. A marshal's aura is dismissed if he is dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by his allies. A marshal begins play knowing one minor aura of his choice. As his marshal level increases, he gains access to new auras, as indicated on Table 1-5: The Marshal. All bonuses granted by a marshal's auras are circumstance bonuses that do not stack with each other.

Grant Move Action			KEY:Marshal ~ Grant Move Action			SORTKEY:Class Marshal	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Marshal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.13	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a marshal can direct and motivate his allies to act immediately. Once per day, as a standard action, he may grant an extra move action to any or all of his allies within 30 feet (but not to himself ). Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order. This extra action does not affect the allies' initiative count; the round continues normally after the marshal's turn is over. (This may mean, for example, that an ally whose initiative count immediately follows the marshal's may get an extra move action from the marshal, followed directly by a full round worth of actions on the ally's turn.) At 8th level, a marshal gains the ability to grant an extra move action to his allies twice per day. The frequency increases to three times per day at 12th level, four times per day at 16th level, and five times per day at 20th level. A character can take only one extra move action per round. (In other words, two marshals can't use this ability on the same ally in the same round.) If an ally chooses not to take the extra move action, it is lost.

# Class Features: Favored Soul Pg.7
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Favored Soul ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Favored Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:[Not implemented]Favored souls are proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields). A favored soul is also proficient with her deity’s favored weapon. Although a favored soul is not proficient with heavy armor, wearing it does not interfere with her spellcasting.
Spells				KEY:Favored Soul ~ Spells						SOURCEPAGE:p.7	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Favored Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:[Not implemented]A favored soul casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to clerics), which are drawn from the cleric spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric must. To cast a spell, a favored soul must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell’s level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a favored soul’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the favored soul’s Wisdom modifier. Like other spellcasters, a favored soul can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-2: The Favored Soul. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1, page 8 of the Player’s Handbook). Unlike that of a cleric, a favored soul’s selection of spells is limited. A favored soul begins play knowing four 0-level spells and three 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new favored soul level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1-3: Favored Soul Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a favored soul knows is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 1-3 are fixed.) Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered favored soul level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a favored soul can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the favored soul “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level favored soul spell the character can cast. A favored soul may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level. Unlike a cleric, a favored soul need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.

A favored soul who is neither lawful nor chaotic may choose either type of damage reduction.


# Class Features: Healer Pg.9
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Healer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality			ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=ArmorProfLight|TYPE=WeaponProfSimple	DESC:Healers are proficient with all simple weapons and with light armor. Additionally, a healer who uses metal armor or any kind of shield is severely hampered. The armor of a healer is restricted by traditional oaths, not simply training. A healer knows how to wear light metal armor and could become proficient with medium or heavy armor, but wearing metal armor or bearing a shield would violate her oath and suppress her healer powers. Her ethos requires a certain vulnerability that allows her to more fully empathize with those in their care. A healer who uses prohibited armor is unable to cast healer spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class features while doing so and for 24 hours after the armor is taken off.
Spells					KEY:Healer ~ Spells						SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A healer casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to clerics), which are drawn from the healer spell list given below. A healer must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below). To prepare or cast a spell, a healer must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell’s level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1stlevel spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a healer’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the healer’s Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a healer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-4: The Healer. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1, page 8 of the Player’s Handbook). Healers do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them through their own strength of faith. Each healer must choose a time at which she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a healer can prepare spells. A healer may prepare and cast any spell on the healer spell list (see below), provided she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.
Healing Hands				KEY:Healer ~ Healing Hands					SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:Whenever a healer casts a spell that cures hit point damage, she adds her Charisma modifier to the amount of damage healed. For instance, if a 5th-level healer with an 18 Charisma casts cure light wounds, she cures 1d8+5 points of damage normally, plus an additional 4 points of damage due to her Charisma bonus. This bonus applies only to spells of the healing subschool that she casts as a healer, not to those that she may have by virtue of levels in another class.
Skill Focus (Heal)			KEY:Healer ~ Skill Focus (Heal)				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A healer’s focused training grants her this bonus feat at 2nd level. If she already has that feat, she may choose a different one.

Cleanse Disease				KEY:Healer ~ Cleanse Disease					SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 4th level, a healer gains the ability to cleanse disease once per day, as if casting a remove disease spell.

Effortless Healing			KEY:Healer ~ Effortless Healing				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:At 7th level, a healer has learned to cast spells of the healing subschool with minimal effort. She may cast such spells without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability applies only to spells of the healing subschool that she casts as a healer, not to those that she may have by virtue of levels in another class.
Unicorn Companion				KEY:Healer ~ Unicorn Companion				SOURCEPAGE:p.9	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DESC:When a healer attains 8th level, the deities recognize her devotion and grant her a celestial unicorn companion as her mount and aide. The unicorn, a symbol of healing and purity, serves the healer willingly and unswervingly. Once per day, as a full-round action, the healer may magically call her companion from the celestial realms in which it resides. The companion immediately appears adjacent to the healer and remains for 2 hours per healer level. It may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The companion is the same creature each time it is called, though the healer may release a particular companion from service to gain a companion of a different kind. Each time the companion is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The companion also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a companion is a conjuration (calling) effect. A healer of 12th level or higher may select from alternative lists of companions (see the sidebar). Should she select a companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character’s healer level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character’s healer level and compare the result with the healer level entry on the table in the sidebar to determine the companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the healer’s effective level to 0 or lower, she can’t have that creature as a companion.) For example, a 12th-level healer could select a lammasu as a companion. The lammasu would have characteristics and special abilities as if the healer were 8th level (taking into account the -4 adjustment) instead of 12th level. Should the healer’s companion die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The healer may not call another companion for 30 days or until she gains a healer level, whichever comes first, even if the companion is somehow returned from the dead. During this 30-day period, the healer is distraught and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Healer Companion ~ Base

The healer cannot see through the companion’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Note that unicorns see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible. Because of this empathic link, the healer has the same connection to an item or place that her companion does, just as with a master and his familiar (see the Familiars sidebar, page 52 of the Player’s Handbook).

Share Spells		KEY:Healer Companion ~ Share Spells					SOURCEPAGE:p.10	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At the healer’s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her companion. The companion must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the companion if the creature moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the companion again even if it returns to the healer before the duration expires. Additionally, the healer may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A healer and her companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (magical beast).
