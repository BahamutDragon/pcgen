Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Beguiler ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Beguiler Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Beguilers are proficient with all simple weapons plus the hand crossbow, rapier, shortbow, and short sword.

Spells				KEY:Beguiler ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Beguiler Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A beguiler casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the beguiler spell list on page 11. When you gain access to a new level of spells, you automatically know all the spells for that level on the beguiler's spell list. You can cast any spell you know without preparing it ahead of time. Essentially, your spell list is the same as your spells known list. You also have the option of adding to your existing spell list through your advanced learning class feature (see below) as you increase in level. To cast a beguiler spell, you must have an Intelligence score of 10 + the spell's level (Int 10 for 0-level spells, Int 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a beguiler's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the beguiler's Int modifier. Like other spellcasters, a beguiler can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. The base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1. In addition, you receive bonus spells for a high Intelligence score (PH 8). A beguiler need not prepare spells in advance. You can cast any spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your spells per day for that spell level.																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.6
Armored Mage			KEY:Beguiler ~ Armored Mage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Beguiler Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause your spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A beguiler's limited focus and specialized training, however, allow you to avoid any chance of arcane spell failure as long as you restrict yourself to light armor. This training does not extend to any other form of armor, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes.																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Trapfinding				KEY:Beguiler ~ Trapfinding				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Beguiler Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Beguilers can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Beguilers can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap typically has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A beguiler who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with his allies) without disarming it.																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Cloaked Casting			KEY:Beguiler ~ Cloaked Casting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Beguiler Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:CloakedCastingLVL|0		DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a beguiler's spells become more effective when cast against an unwary foe. You gain a +1 bonus to the spell's save DC when you cast a spell that targets any foe who would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not). At 8th level, you gain a +2 bonus on rolls made to overcome the spell resistance of any affected target. At 14th level, the bonus to your spell's save DC increases to +2. At 20th level, you become able to automatically overcome the spell resistance of any affected target.

Surprise Casting			KEY:Beguiler ~ Surprise Casting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Beguiler Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:SurpriseCastingLVL|0		DESC:Starting at 2nd level, when you successfully use the Bluff skill to feint in combat, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus (if it has one) to AC for the next melee attack you make against it or the next spell you cast. You must remain in melee with the target, and the attack must be made or the spell cast on or before your next turn. The target is not considered flat-footed and therefore can make attacks of opportunity against you if you do not cast defensively. At 6th level, you gain the ability to feint in combat as a move action instead of a standard action. If you have the Improved Feint feat, you can now feint in combat as a swift action.

Your evoker's fireball spell deals as much damage as that of a conjurer, diviner, or necromancer, and doesn't look any different. By taking the immediate magic alternative class feature, you gain a useful trick that sets you apart from other specialists. Though giving up your familiar is a hardship, it means you have one less thing to worry about in a fight. Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Immediate Magic	KEY:Wizard ACF ~ Immediate Magic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike.Immediate Magic Selection	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLS|CLASSLIST=Wizard[LEVELMIN=0;LEVELMAX=1]	DESC:Benefit: You gain a spell-like ability that reflects your chosen school of magic. Activating this ability is an immediate action, and you can use this spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Its equivalent spell level is equal to one-half your wizard level (minimum 1st), and the caster level is your wizard level. The save DC (if any) is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Int modifi er. This is an extraordinary ability. You can't activate this ability in response to an attack that you aren't aware of. For instance, if an invisible rogue strikes at you, you can't activate urgent shield to gain a bonus to your AC against the attack. All effects last until the start of your next turn unless otherwise noted.

If your ranger would prefer to avoid the hassle of taking care of an animal companion, you can get some of the same benefit with the distracting attack alternative class feature. Though not as effective as an actual flanker, the ability to spread out your attacks to affect multiple enemies is a nice side effect.  Level: 4th  Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain an animal companion.   Benefit: Beginning at 4th level, whenever you hit an enemy with a weapon attack (whether melee or ranged), that enemy is considered flanked by you for the purpose of adjudicating your allies attacks. For example, if your rogue ally attacked that enemy, nor only would she gain a +2 bonus on her melee attack roll but she could also add her sneak attack damage to a successful melee attack. This flanked condition lasts until either the enemy is attacked by one of your allies or until the start of your next turn, whichever comes first. This is an extraordinary ability. This ability has no effect on creatures that can't be flanked.		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Ranger ACF ~ Distracting Attack
