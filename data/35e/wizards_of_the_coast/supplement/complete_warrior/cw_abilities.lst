Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Hexblade ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hexblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Hexblades are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for hexblade spells are simple, a hexblade can cast hexblade spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a hexblade wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (and most do). A multiclass hexblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes.

Hexblade's Curse					KEY:Hexblade ~ Hexblade's Curse						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hexblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:HexbladesCurseTimes|0		DESC:Once per day, as a free action, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe. The target must be visible to the hexblade and within 60 feet. The target of a hexblade's curse takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 hour thereafter. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 hexblade's class level + hexblade's Cha modifier) negates the effect. At every four levels beyond 1st (5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th) a hexblade gains the ability to use his curse one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 1-1. Multiple hexblade's curses don't stack, and any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected again by the same hexblade's curse for 24 hours. Any effect that removes or dispels a curse eliminates the effect of a hexblade's curse.

Mettle						KEY:Hexblade ~ Mettle								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hexblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary										DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a hexblade can resist magical and unusual attacks with great willpower or fortitude. If he makes a successful Will or Fortitude save against an attack that normally would have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), he instead completely negates the effect. An unconscious or sleeping hexblade does not gain the benefit of mettle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Summon Familiar					KEY:Hexblade ~ Familiar								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hexblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant. The hexblade chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the hexblade advances in level, his familiar also increases in power. Treat the hexblade as a sorcerer of three levels lower for determining the familiar's powers and abilities (see the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Player's Handbook). If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the hexblade, the latter must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per hexblade level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a hexblade's experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, but it does not lose a level or a point of Constitution when this happy event occurs. A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																													ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Familiar																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.7
Spells						KEY:Hexblade ~ Spells								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hexblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a hexblade gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from the hexblade spell list (see Chapter 3). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the Player's Handbook). To learn or cast a spell, a hexblade must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so forth). The Diffi- culty Class for a saving throw against a hexblade's spell is 10 + the spell level + the hexblade's Cha modifier. Like other spellcasters, a hexblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). When Table 1-1 indicates that the hexblade gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level hexblade), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The hexblade's selection of spells is extremely limited. A hexblade begins play knowing no spells, but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on Table 1-2. (Unlike spells per day, his Charisma score does not affect the number of spells a hexblade knows; the numbers on Table 1-2 are fixed.) Upon reaching 12th level, and at every third hexblade level after that (15th and 18th), a hexblade can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the hexblade "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level hexblade spell the hexblade can cast. For instance, upon reaching 12th level, a hexblade could trade in a single 1stlevel spell (two spell levels below the highest-level hexblade spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell. At 15th level, he could trade in a single 1st-level or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level hexblade spells) for a different spell of the same level. A hexblade may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. Through 3rd level, a hexblade has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his hexblade level.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Any melee or ranged attack made against the hexblade while this aura of unluck is active has a 20%% miss chance (similar to the effect of concealment). Activating the aura is a free action, and the aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the hexblade's Charisma bonus (if any). At 16th level and higher, a hexblade can use his aura of unluck twice per day. A 20th-level hexblade can activate this aura three times per day.

Bear Form						KEY:Bear Warrior ~ Bear Form							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Bear Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															DESC:A bear warrior can transform into a bear (similar to the polymorph spell) while in a rage or frenzy. His only limit on the number of times per day he can assume a bear form is the number of times per day he enters a rage or frenzy, and the bear warrior returns to his own form once the rage or frenzy ends. The bear warrior retains the normal +2 bonus on Will saves and -2 penalty to Armor Class while raging, but the ability score bonuses granted by rage or frenzy are replaced by Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution bonuses appropriate to the bear form taken (see below). As normal for polymorph, the bear warrior gains the bear form's physical qualities (including size, movement, natural armor bonus, natural weapons, space, and reach), as well as any ex tra ordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as improved grab in the brown bear or dire bear form). The transformation lasts for the duration of the rage or frenzy. Unlike with the polymorph spell, a bear warrior doesn't gain the bear's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores when he takes bear form, nor does he regain any hit points when he transforms. However, his current hit points increase due to his new Constitution, as normal for a rage ability. Any bear warrior can assume the form of a black bear once per day. While in black bear form, he gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and a +4 bonus to Constitution. At 5th level, a bear warrior can assume bear form twice per day and can choose between black and brown bear forms. While in brown bear form, he gains a +16 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and a +8 bonus to Constitution. At 10th level, a bear warrior can assume bear form three times per day and can choose between black, brown, and dire bear forms.

This bonus also applies on Search checks made to detect stonework traps.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Enhanced Darkvision				KEY:Dark Hunter ~ Enhanced Darkvision					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dark Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:Dark hunters spend most of their lives in the darkest caverns they can find. As a dark hunter's skills improve, her almost mystical understanding of the deep caverns sharpens her inborn visual acuity. If a dark hunter does not already have darkvision when she attains 2nd level, she gains it at a range of 30 feet. If she already had darkvision, she adds 30 feet to the range. Once a dark hunter attains 4th level, her darkvision range increases by an extra 30 feet. This bonus stacks with other natural or extraordinary abilities that improve darkvision, but it does nothing to improve magically granted darkvision. Any condition that causes the character to lose her normal darkvision also causes the enhanced darkvision to fail.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Sneak Attack					KEY:Dark Hunter ~ Sneak Attack						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dark Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:If a dark hunter can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the dark hunter's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the dark hunter's attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. Should a dark hunter score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a dark hunter can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the sneak attack. A dark hunter can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The dark hunter must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A dark hunter cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If a dark hunter gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Stone's Hue						KEY:Dark Hunter ~ Stone's Hue							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dark Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural															DESC:When within 5 feet of a stone or earth wall, a dark hunter can take on the coloration of the stone and may seem to blend into the surface of the wall. As long as the dark hunter is within 5 feet of the wall, she gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks and can successfully hide herself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Death Attack					KEY:Dark Hunter ~ Death Attack						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dark Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:If a dark hunter studies her victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (dark hunter's choice). While studying the target, the dark hunter can undertake other actions as long as her attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the dark hunter or recognize the dark hunter as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the dark hunter's class level + the dark hunter's Int modifier) against the kill effect, he dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering him helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the dark hunter. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the dark hunter has completed the 3 rounds of study, she must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if the dark hunter does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before she can attempt another death attack.

He gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls against these creatures. A darkwood stalker also gets the bonus on damage with ranged weapons, but only against targets within 30 feet (the darkwood stalker cannot strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus on damage does not apply against creatures that are im mune to critical hits. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the darkwood stalker's bonus goes up by +2. This bonus stacks with a favored enemy bonus (if any) acquired through ranger levels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Uncanny Dodge					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Uncanny Dodge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge														DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a darkwood stalker gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a darkwood stalker already had the uncanny dodge ability from another class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

Darkvision						KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Darkvision						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Although stealthy and keen-eyed, the darkwood stalker is often at a disadvantage against orcs when fighting in the darkness. Long ago, elven sages developed a ritual to allow the most dedicated stalkers to overcome this disadvantage. Now, as they grow in experience, their night vision continually improves, eventually matching the darkvision of their hated foes. At 4th level, a darkwood stalker gains darkvision out to 30 feet, and at 7th level, the range increases to 60 feet. If the darkwood stalker already has darkvision as a racial ability, this ability does not increase it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Improved Uncanny Dodge				KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge														DESC:At 5th level and higher, a darkwood stalker can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies other characters the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack him. The exception to this defense is that a rogue of at least four levels higher than the character can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a darkwood stalker gains the uncanny dodge ability from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Dodge Critical					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Dodge Critical					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Although often more skilled than their orc foes, darkwood stalkers have seen too many battles won by one lucky blow from a falchion. At 8th level, a darkwood stalker becomes able to turn even the luckiest blow into a grazing strike. Once per day, a darkwood stalker can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + the enhancement bonus, if any, possessed by the weapon) to turn a critical hit dealt upon him into a normal hit. The darkwood stalker must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed, and he must declare his attempt to reduce the effect of the critical hit before the damage from the hit is rolled.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Death Attack					KEY:Darkwood Stalker ~ Death Attack						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Darkwood Stalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:If a 10th-level darkwood stalker studies a particular orc for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. While studying the orc, the darkwood hunter can undertake other actions as long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the darkwood stalker or recognize the darkwood stalker as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the darkwood stalker's class level + the darkwood stalker's Wis modifier), he dies. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the darkwood stalker has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if the darkwood stalker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.

An eye of Gruumsh's class levels stack with his barbarian levels (if any) for determining the number of times per day he can use his rage ability. Add together the character's levels in the eye of Gruumsh and barbarian classes and refer to Table 3-3: The Barbarian on page 25 of the Player's Handbook to determine the number of rages per day. For example, a 6th-level barbarian/2nd-level eye of Gruumsh could rage three times per day (the same as an 8thlevel barbarian), while a 4th-level eye of Gruumsh with no levels in barbarian could rage twice per day (the same as a 4th-level barbarian).

With a successful ranged touch attack (at a -4 penalty), he spits his stomach acid into the target's eyes. An opponent who fails a Reflex save (DC 10 + eye of Gruumsh's class level + eye of Gruumsh's Con modifier) is blinded until he or she can rinse away the spittle. This attack has no effect on creatures that don't have eyes or don't depend on vision.

Frenzy						KEY:Frenzied Berserker ~ Frenzy						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Frenzied Berserker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:A frenzied berserker can enter a frenzy during combat. While frenzied, she gains a +6 bonus to Strength and, if she makes a full attack action, gains a single extra attack each round at her highest bonus. (This latter effect is not cumulative with haste or other effects that grant additional attacks.) However, she also takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and takes 2 points of nonlethal damage per round. A frenzy lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the frenzied berserker's Constitution modifier. To end the frenzy before its duration expires, the character may attempt a DC 20 Will save once per round as a free action. Success ends the frenzy immediately; failure means it continues. The effects of frenzy stack with those from any rage ability the character may have. At 1st level, the character can enter a frenzy once per day. Thereafter, she gains one additional use per day of this ability for every two frenzied berserker levels she acquires (but she can't use the ability more than once in any encounter). The character can enter a frenzy as a free action. Even though this takes no time, she can do it only during her turn, not in response to another's action. In addition, if she takes damage from an attack, spell, trap, or any other source, she automatically enters a frenzy at the start of her next action, as long as she still has at least one daily usage of the ability left. To avoid entering a frenzy in response to a provoking effect, the character must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + points of damage taken since her last action) at the start of her next turn. While frenzied, the character cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Intimidate), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can she cast spells, drink potions, activate magic items, or read scrolls. She can use any feat she has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, or metamagic feats. She can use her special ability to inspire frenzy (see below) normally. During a frenzy, the frenzied berserker must attack those she perceives as foes to the best of her ability. Should she run out of enemies before her frenzy expires, her rampage continues. She must then attack the nearest creature (determine randomly if several potential foes are equidistant) and fight that opponent without regard to friendship, innocence, or health (the target's or her own). When a frenzy ends, the frenzied berserker is fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity, unable to charge or run) for the duration of the encounter. If the character is still under the effect of a rage ability, the fatigued condition does not apply until the rage ends-at which point the character is exhausted, not merely fatigued.

Deathless Frenzy					KEY:Frenzied Berserker ~ Deathless Frenzy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Frenzied Berserker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:At 4th level and higher, a frenzied berserker can scorn death and unconsciousness while in a frenzy. As long as her frenzy continues, she is not treated as disabled at 0 hit points, nor is she treated as dying at -1 to -9 hit points. Even if reduced to -10 hit points or less, she continues to fight normally until her frenzy ends. At that point, the effects of her wounds apply normally if they have not been healed. This ability does not prevent death from massive damage or from spell effects such as slay living or disintegrate.

When she uses this ability, all willing allies within 10 feet of her gain the benefits and the disadvantages of frenzy as if they had that ability themselves. The frenzy of affected allies lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the frenzied berserker's Constitution modifier, regardless of whether they remain within 10 feet of her.

In addition, a gnome giant-slayer can move through an area occupied by a creature two size categories larger than he is. This doesn't apply against creatures that completely fill their area, such as a gelatinous cube.

Defensive Roll					KEY:Gnome Giant-Slayer ~ Defensive Roll					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Gnome Giant-Slayer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:A 10th-level gnome giant-slayer can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than he otherwise would. Once per day, when he would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow struck by a giant, not a spell or special ability), he can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, he makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt; the gnome giant-slayer adds his class level as a bonus on this saving throw). If the save succeeds, he takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, he takes full damage. He must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute his defensive roll-if he is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, he can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the character's evasion or improved evasion ability (if applicable) does not apply to the defensive roll.

Most halfling communities attempt to provide an out rider with a riding dog or a warpony. A halfling outrider may, of course, choose to find and train or purchase a more exotic mount. Standard tack and harness is also provided, though, again, the character may wish to purchase masterwork or magic gear. Halfling outrider class levels stack with paladin, druid, and ranger levels for determining the characteristics of a paladin's mount or an animal companion.

If she does nothing else while mounted (she cannot attack when riding defensively), she gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves and a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class. In addition, her mount gains a +20 ft. bonus to its speed, a +2 bonus on all Will saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to its Armor Class.

While standing on her mount's back, a halfling outrider does not take any penalty for using a ranged weapon while her mount is taking a double move or running (see the Mounted Archery feat description, page 98 of the Player's Handbook).

Leap from the Saddle				KEY:Halfling Outrider ~ Leap from the Saddle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Halfling Outrider Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:A halfling outrider of 5th level or higher can dismount and land adjacent to her mount as a free action by making a DC 20 Ride check. If an opponent is in a square she threatens (after dismounting), she can make a melee attack against that opponent, taking a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a -2 penalty to Armor Class (just as if the character were making a charge). This ability is usable only if the mount is moving no faster than twice its speed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Evasion						KEY:Halfling Outrider ~ Evasion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Halfling Outrider Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:At 7th level, a halfling outrider gains the evasion ability. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the halfling outrider is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless halfling outrider (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of the ability. While the halfling outrider is mounted, she confers this ability to her mount as well, and the mount is able to use the halfling outrider's Reflex save bonus or its own, whichever is higher. If the character already has the evasion ability, she gains improved evasion instead, and her mount still receives the benefit of evasion as described above. Improved evasion works like evasion, except that while the character still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw, she takes only half damage on a failed save.

The turn may be up to 90 degrees, and the mount may make only one such turn per round. If the Ride check fails, the mount moves an extra 10 feet in a straight line and then loses the rest of its actions on this turn.

Really Throw Anything				KEY:Hulking Hurler ~ Really Throw Anything				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hulking Hurler Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:A hulking hurler gains the Throw Anything feat (described in Chapter 3 of this book) as a bonus feat. However, since a hulking hurler depends on brute strength more than skill, he can throw anything (not just weapons) he can lift as a light load. If the item is an improvised weapon, he takes a -2 penalty on his attack roll instead of the normal -4. Use the rules in Chapter 4 of this book to determine the amount of damage the thrown weapon does. The range increment of a thrown weapon or improvised weapon wielded by a hulking hurler is 10 feet + 5 feet per size category the hulking hurler is beyond Large (this is a modification of the Throw Anything feat).

Spells						KEY:Hunter of the Dead ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hunter of the Dead Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a hunter of the dead gains the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast a spell, a hunter of the dead must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a hunter of the dead with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Hunter of the dead bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the hunter of the dead's Wisdom bonus (if any). When the hunter of the dead gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level hunter of the dead), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The hunter of the dead's spell list appears below; she has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare. A hunter of the dead prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a hunter of the dead cannot lose a spell to cast a cure spell in its place).

Smite Undead					KEY:Hunter of the Dead ~ Smite Undead					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Hunter of the Dead Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Once per day, a hunter of the dead of 2nd level or higher can attempt to smite undead with one normal melee attack. She adds her Wisdom modifier (if positive) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per level. For example, an 8th-level hunter of the dead armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+8 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses for Strength and magical effects that normally apply. If a hunter of the dead accidentally smites a creature that is not undead, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. Note: A paladin/hunter of the dead can both smite evil and smite undead in the same day, potentially against the same target (if it's an evil undead).

Dagger Sneak Attack				KEY:Invisible Blade ~ Dagger Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Invisible Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:An invisible blade gains the sneak attack ability (see the description of the dark hunter, earlier in this chapter) if he does not already have it, but the extra damage applies only to sneak attacks made with a dagger, kukri, or punching dagger (the DM may allow other similar weapons). When making a sneak attack with one of these weapons, he deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st level, and this increases to 2d6 at 3rd level and to 3d6 at 5th level. If he already has the sneak attack ability from a previous class, the applicable bonuses on damage rolls stack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Unfettered Defense				KEY:Invisible Blade ~ Unfettered Defense					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Invisible Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:An invisible blade benefits from an increased survival instinct during combat. Because of this sixth sense, he adds 1 point of Intelligence bonus (if any) per invisible blade class level to his Armor Class in addition to any other modifiers he would normally receive. If the invisible blade is caught flat-footed or is otherwise denied his Dexterity modifier to Armor Class, he also loses this bonus. Unfettered defense functions only when an invisible blade is not wearing armor and is armed with one or more daggers, kukris, or punching daggers as his only weapons.

Bleeding Wound					KEY:Invisible Blade ~ Bleeding Wound					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Invisible Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:An invisible blade of 2nd level or higher who makes a successful dagger sneak attack can choose to deal a bleeding wound, sacrificing 1d6 points of the extra damage from the dagger sneak attack. Such an attack deals damage as normal in the round when the attack hits. Thereafter, the wound caused by the invisible blade's dagger bleeds for 1 point of damage per round. Multiple wounds from the weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can only be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any cure spell or other healing spell (heal, healing circle, and so on). Creatures immune to sneak attack damage are immune to bleeding wounds as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Uncanny Feint					KEY:Invisible Blade ~ Uncanny Feint						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Invisible Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															DESC:At 3rd level, an invisible blade gains the ability to feint in combat (see page 68 of the Player's Handbook) as a move action rather than a standard action. At 5th level, the character can feint in combat as a free action. An invisible blade can use uncanny feint only when armed with a dagger, kukri, or punching dagger.

Bring 'em Back Alive				KEY:Justicar ~ Bring 'em Back Alive						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Justicar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:Whenever a justiciar attacks with a melee weapon, he can deal nonlethal damage with the weapon instead of lethal damage with no penalty on the attack roll. Normally, attempting to deal nonlethal damage with a weapon in this way incurs a -4 penalty on the attack roll.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.47
Nonlethal Strike					KEY:Justicar ~ Nonlethal Strike						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Justicar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:A justiciar can make nonlethal strikes. Any time the character uses the bring 'em back alive ability and his target would be denied her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not) or when the justiciar flanks the target, the justiciar's attack deals an extra 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 4th level, 3d6 at 7th level, and 4d6 at 10th level. Should the justiciar score a critical hit with a nonlethal strike, this extra damage is not multiplied. A justiciar can use nonlethal strike only on a living creature with discernible anatomy-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures are not subject to this extra damage. Also, creatures immune to nonlethal damage are immune to nonlethal strike damage. The justiciar cannot make a nonlethal strike against a creature with concealment.

A justiciar of 3rd level or higher can swing a pair of metal manacles in one hand as if they were a club without taking a penalty for using an improvised weapon. Masterwork manacles can be wielded as if they were a masterwork light flail.

SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Hog-Tie						KEY:Justicar ~ Hog-Tie								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Justicar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:When a justiciar of 5th level or higher successfully pins an opponent while grappling, he can attempt to hog-tie the opponent (in addition to his other options; see If You're Pinning an Opponent on page 156 of the Player's Handbook). A justiciar must have a rope, chain, or manacles in one hand to use this ability. A justiciar can use this ability on an opponent of up to one size category larger than he is (for example, a halfling justiciar can attempt to hog-tie a Medium or smaller opponent). He can use the ability only against humanoid-shaped creatures (thus, most humanoids, monstrous humanoids, outsiders, and giants would qualify). An attempt to hog-tie is resolved with an opposed check. The justiciar can make a Use Rope check instead of a normal grapple check, while the opponent makes either a grapple check or an Escape Artist check. If the justiciar succeeds, the opponent is hog-tied. If the opponent succeeds, the hogtie attempt fails and the grapple continues. If a justiciar successfully hog-ties an opponent, that person is considered bound and helpless. A bound opponent can attempt to escape by making an Escape Artist check opposed by the justiciar's Use Rope check (including his +10 bonus; see Bind a Character on page 86 of the Player's Handbook) or a Strength check (DC 23 for rope, DC 26 for chain or manacles, DC 28 for masterwork manacles) to break free.

Also, if the justiciar has the Quick Draw feat, he does not need to be holding the rope, chain, or manacles in his hand before making the attempt.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Intuition						KEY:Justicar ~ Intuition							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Justicar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:When hunting a specific person, a 10thlevel justiciar can use a Survival check to determine in which direction the culprit might be found if the criminal is within 1 mile of the justiciar (DC 15 + target's HD). A justiciar can use this ability to determine the direction of anyone he has previously faced in combat if he or she is within range. The DM should make this check secretly for the justiciar, since the character should not know if he failed the check because of the die roll or because the target is too far away. A justiciar can make this check once per day for any single target.

SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Signature Weapon					KEY:Kensai ~ Signature Weapon							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:The kensai chooses one of his weapons (it must be one for which he has the Weapon Focus feat) to become a signature weapon. Most kensai choose either a sword or bow for this weapon, but even a kensai's natural weapons can be chosen. If the weapon is a manufactured one, it must be of at least masterwork quality. Upon qualifying for the class, a kensai gains the ability to establish a link with his signature weapon. The character focuses part of his life energy on the weapon, making it more effective in his hands and his hands alone. The process for imbuing a signature weapon with power is a simple one. The character must find a quiet, safe spot to meditate (and pray, for those kensai who serve deities) for 24 hours. At the end of this meditation, the kensai sacrifices a number of experience points, essentially shifting some of his life force into his signature weapon. The signature weapon then becomes a magic weapon (if it wasn't already) and gains an enhancement bonus and/or special abilities. His current class level limits the amount of enhancement a kensai can place into his signature weapon. A kensai cannot create a signature weapon if doing so would cost enough experience points to reduce his character level. Use the table on the previous page to determine XP costs and class level limits. If the ritual is interrupted, it can be begun again at any time, but it must run for a full 24 hours for the signature weapon to be imbued. The kensai pays the XP cost as soon as the ritual has been completed. A kensai's signature weapon has a caster level equal to the character's class level + 10.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Imbuing Double Weapons				KEY:Kensai ~ Imbuing Double Weapons						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:A double weapon may be imbued, but both ends of the weapon must be paid for and imbued separately.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Imbuing Natural Weapons				KEY:Kensai ~ Imbuing Natural Weapons					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:The process for imbuing a kensai's natural weapons (such as his fists) is the same as for a manufactured weapon, except all of the kensai's natural weapons of one type are imbued at 100%% of the cost + 10%% per natural weapon. For example, a human kensai who has Weapon Focus (unarmed strike) may turn his fists into signature weapons for 120%% of the XP cost. A six-armed kensai with a bite and tail attack would have to choose between fists, bite, and tail and pay either 160%% of the cost (for six fists) or 110%% of the cost (for the single bite or tail). A kensai who imbues a particular type of natural weapon must imbue all his natural weapons of that type (so a human kensai with two fists must imbue both fists). It takes 24 hours for a kensai to imbue one type of natural weapon, regardless of how many actual weapons of that type he possesses.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Losing a Signature Weapon			KEY:Kensai ~ Losing a Signature Weapon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:If a kensai's signature weapon is lost or stolen, the character must strive to recover it by any means that do not violate his oath or alignment. A kensai who knowingly abandons a signature weapon is treated as if he broke his oath of service (see the sidebar). A kensai who abandons a signature weapon and atones for the deed can begin to create a new signature weapon. If someone destroys a kensai's signature weapon, only the kensai can repair it. If enough is left of the weapon to salvage (the shattered shards of a sword, for example), the kensai can reforge the weapon as if he were using the Craft (weaponsmithing) skill to make a masterwork weapon. If he takes the reforged weapon and then meditates for 24 hours, he may pay the appropriate XP cost to restore his weapon to full strength. Should nothing remain of the weapon, the kensai must begin anew with a weapon that has never before been imbued. The character, however, has not failed in his oath-the destruction of a kensai's weap on in service of his oath is not shameful, and other kensai are likely to show even more respect to a comrade whose weapon is destroyed in oathbound service.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Losing Natural Weapons				KEY:Kensai ~ Losing Natural Weapons						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:If a kensai loses his natural weapons (such as his fists), he may have them regrown by using regeneration or a similar spell. In this singular case, the kensai does not need to spend any more XP or time to reimbue his signature weapon with power. The link is direct enough that no extra effort is necessary.

Power Surge						KEY:Kensai ~ Power Surge							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:At 2nd level, a kensai gains the ability to make a DC 15 Concentration check as a move action to focus his energy and spirit. If he succeeds, he gains +8 to his Strength for a number of rounds equal to one-half his class level. Each time after the first that a kensai successfully uses this ability in a single 24-hour period, the check DC increases by 5.

At 8th level and higher, the kensai adds his full class level to such checks. A target that realizes it has been fooled by a kensai's successful Bluff check gains a +10 bonus on any check or saving throw involving the kensai's use of Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, or Intimidate against that target in the future. The kensai can regain the creature's trust by changing its attitude from unfriendly to friendly (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Player's Handbook).

Instill						KEY:Kensai ~ Instill								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																DESC:Once per day, a kensai of 8th level or higher may take a full-round action to make a Concentration check (DC 10 + target's HD or character level) to impart some of his own ability into a willing ally he can touch. The kensai then transfers some of his power to the ally: He subtracts up to 1 point per class level from his base attack bonus and/or any or all of his base save bonuses and transfers the same amount to the recipient. The kensai regains the instilled power 1 hour later, when it transfers back out of the ally. If the ally dies before the instilled power is transferred back, the kensai must make a Fortitude save (DC 5 + target's HD or character level) or die as well. If he succeeds, he immediately gets his instilled powers back.

Ki Warlord						KEY:Kensai ~ Ki Warlord								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Kensai Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:When a kensai attains 10th level, he gains great notoriety and becomes known as a ki warlord. Other kensai of the same alignment revere the ki warlord, and even those of differing alignments treat him with some measure of respect. If the ki warlord has an NPC master, this master likely assigns the ki warlord more responsibility and authority within his domain (perhaps giving him a castle, monastery, or military school). If the ki warlord serves a deity, that deity may take a personal interest in giving the ki warlord more responsibility, perhaps actually contacting the ki warlord directly or through intermediaries and making the deity's wishes known. In addition to this added responsibility, a ki warlord gains some tangible benefits. He has the right to petition other (lower-level) members of the prestige class for assistance on adventures or in the fulfillment of his oath. As long as a ki warlord's requests do not violate the other members' own oaths of service or alignment, lower-level kensai have a responsibility to assist a ki warlord in any reasonable manner-such as providing food and shelter, access to minor resources, and other things another character might have to barter for. Ki warlords inspire those around them. When fighting within 30 feet of a ki warlord, allies gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, Concentration checks, and attack rolls. Lawful allies gain a +2 morale bonus on these checks.

To cast a spell, a knight of the Chalice must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a knight with a Wisdom of 10 or lower can not cast these spells. Knight of the Chalice bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the knight's Wisdom modifier. When the knight gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level knight), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The knight of the Chalice's spell list appears below; he has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare.

A 1st-level knight of the Chalice gets a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls against evil outsiders. On a successful attack, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage due to her expertise in combating these creatures. These bonuses increase as the knight advances in level, as shown on Table 2-19. A 1st-level knight of the Chalice's +1 competence bonus also applies to Intimidate, Listen, Sense Motive, and Spot checks when she uses these skills against evil outsiders. She gets the same bonus on Will saving throws against attacks from evil outsiders, and on opposed ability checks she makes against evil outsiders.

Censure Demons					KEY:Knight of the Chalice ~ Censure Demons				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Knight of the Chalice Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Knights of the Chalice can censure demons, much as clerics turn undead. Rather than channeling positive energy, a knight of the Chalice channels energy from the celestial planes of lawful good. When a knight of the Chalice uses this ability, any demon within 30 feet must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + the knight of the Chalice's class level + the knight of the Chalice's Cha modifier) or be censured. A censured demon whose Hit Dice are equal to or greater than twice the knight's class level is stunned by the knight's holy power for 1 round. If a censured demon has fewer Hit Dice than twice the knight's class level, it is stunned and must succeed on a second Will save (same DC) or be sent back to its home plane as if it had been the subject of a dismissal spell. Only one demon may dismissed in this way by any single censure demons attempt; if more than one demon is required to make this second Will save, check for the demon with the lowest HD first. A knight may attempt to censure demons once per day for every two class levels she possesses.

He adds his levels in master of the unseen hand to his caster level (whether from actual spellcasting levels or determined by the spell-like ability) when using his telekinesis ability. For example, a 10th-level sorcerer/3rd-level master of the unseen hand casts telekinesis as a 13th-level caster, and a blue slaad who is a 2nd-level master of the unseen hand would use its telekinesis spell-like ability as a 10th-level caster.

For instance, he can use sustained force for 2 rounds, then switch to combat maneuver, then return to using sustained force. The spell or spell-like ability ends after the first use of the violent thrust version, however, or if the master of the unseen hand is unable to maintain concentration.

By maintaining concentration on the combat maneuver version of telekinesis, a master of the unseen hand of 2nd level or higher can make a single attack with an unattended weapon or one he is holding, moving the weapon up to 20 feet before the attack. Resolve the attack as normal, except that the weapon's movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The master of the unseen hand's base attack bonus on this attempt is equal to his caster level plus his Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer or a creature with the telekinesis supernatural or spell-like ability). Any weapon-related feats the master of the unseen hand has (such as Weapon Focus and Power Attack) do not apply when he's telekinetically wielding a weapon.

It only takes a move action, not a standard action, to use the sustained force version of telekinesis (or simply to maintain concentration so the ability doesn't end). The master of the unseen hand can even cast another spell while maintaining concentration on telekinesis, but doing so requires a successful Concentration check as if the caster were distracted by a nondamaging spell (Concentration check DC equal to the save DC of telekinesis). It still takes a standard action to use the combat maneuver or violent thrust versions of the ability, however.

When using the combat maneuver version of telekinesis or wielding a weapon telekinetically, the master of the unseen hand can make a full attack, potentially attacking, bull rushing, disarming, grappling, or tripping more than once per round. Just as with nontelekinetic attacks, the master of the unseen hand gains an additional attack for every 5 points of base attack bonus above +1 (using caster level for base attack bonus as described in the telekinesis spell description).

He uses his caster level in place of his base attack bonus when making the attack roll, and he uses his Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer or a creature with the telekinesis supernatural or spell-like ability) as a bonus on damage rolls if he hurls weapons at the target. Finally, using a violent thrust no longer ends the telekinesis effect, but the master of the unseen hand can't make another violent thrust for 1d4 rounds.

Telekinetic Flight				KEY:Master of the Unseen Hand ~ Telekinetic Flight			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Master of the Unseen Hand Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary													DESC:A master of the unseen hand of 4th level or higher can use the sustained force version of telekinesis to lift himself and willing creatures into the air. With a move action, the master of the unseen hand can move 20 feet with perfect maneuverability and can move willing creatures as well. The master of the unseen hand doesn't have to move all the creatures he's lifting in the same direction, but any lifted creatures plummet to the ground if they move more than 40 feet from the master of the unseen hand. The master of the unseen hand can lift one Medium or smaller creature (carrying up to its maximum load) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. Unlike the form of flight granted by the fly spell, telekinetic flight ends immediately and abruptly if disrupted by dispel magic or a lapse in the master of the unseen hand's concentration. Without telekinesis to support them, creatures fall to the ground immediately, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d6).

Fling Skyward					KEY:Master of the Unseen Hand ~ Fling Skyward				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Master of the Unseen Hand Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary													DESC:Rather than hurling a creature toward another target, a 5th-level master of the unseen hand can use the violent thrust version of telekinesis to hurl a creature straight up. A target is allowed a Will save (and spell resistance) to negate the effect. The master of the unseen hand can lift a creature into the air a maximum distance of 10 feet per caster level. At the beginning of the character's next action, the creature falls to the ground, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen. Unlike other times when a master of the unseen hand uses the violent thrust version of telekinesis, flinging a foe skyward immediately ends the telekinesis effect.

# Warshaper

Morphic Weapons					KEY:Warshaper ~ Morphic Weapons						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warshaper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:As a move action grow a natural weapon of appropriate size for form.  May grow an existing weapon one category larger for damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.90	BENEFIT:As a move action, a warshaper can grow natural weapons such as claws or fangs, allowing a natural attack that deals the appropriate amount of damage according to the size of the new form (see Table 5-1 on page 296 of the Monster Manual). These morphic weapons need not be natural weapons that the creature already possesses. For example, a warshaper polymorphed into an ettin (Large giant) could grow a claw that deals 1d6 points of damage, or horns for a gore attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. If the warshaper's form already has a natural weapon of that type, the weapon deals damage as if it were one category larger. For example, a warshaper who used wild shape to become a dire wolf (Large animal) could grow its jaw and snout, enabling a bite attack that deals 2d6 points of damage (as a for Huge animal), not the normal 1d8. A warshaper can change morphic weapons as often as it likes, even if it is using a shapechanging technique such as the polymorph spell or the wild shape class feature that doesn't allow subsequent changes after the initial transformation.

SOURCEPAGE:p.90	BENEFIT:A warshaper of 3rd level or higher can suddenly stretch its limbs, neck, or other appendages outward, giving it 5 more feet of reach than the creature it's emulating. Unlike most creatures, warshapers don't appear to have a longer reach until they actually use it.
Morphic Healing					KEY:Warshaper ~ Morphic Healing						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warshaper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:Fast Healing 2, spend a full round action and a con check with DC of total damage sustained heals 10 points.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.90	BENEFIT:At 4th level, a warshaper becomes able to change its form where wounds appear, creating smooth skin where once were wounds. The warshaper gains fast healing 2, and if it spends a full-round action and succeeds on a Concentration check (DC equal to the total damage it has sustained), it heals 10 points of damage.
Flashmorph/Multimorph				KEY:Warshaper ~ Flashmorph/Multimorph					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warshaper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																DESC:Flashmorph if can change at will. Multimorph if polymorph or wild shape.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.90	BENEFIT:A 5th-level warshaper gains one of two class features. If the warshaper has the ability to change form at will, such as from the change shape ability, the shapechanger subtype, or a polymorph spell-like ability, it gains the flashmorph class feature, allowing it to change form as a move action. If it casts the polymorph spell, has polymorph as a spell-like ability usable less often than at will, or has the wild shape class feature, it instead gains the multimorph class feature. Multimorph allows a warshaper to change forms multiple times during the duration of the spell, spell-like ability, or class feature that enables her to change form. For example, a wizard/warshaper could polymorph into a troll for 2 minutes, then change into a red dragon for 4 minutes, and then spend the rest of the spell's duration in the form of a hill giant. Each change requires a standard action, and only the first transformation heals the warshaper. If the warshaper changes into its natural form, the spell, spell-like ability, or use of wild shape ends.
