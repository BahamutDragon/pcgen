Anti-Impact		KEY:ANTI_IMPACT	TYPE:Armor.Shield			COST:2000	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.139	PREMULT:2,[PRETYPE:1,Enhancement],[PRETYPE:1,Armor,Shield]						SPROP:Armor with the anti-impact quality is designed to cushion the blow from massive blunt traumas. Anti-impact armor doesn't give extra protection against weapon damage (beyond its AC bonus), but bludgeoning damage that affects all or most of the entire body (such as constriction and falling damage) is halved. Faint Abjuration; CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, feather fall; Price +2,000 gp.																																									ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Axeblock		KEY:AXEBLOCK	TYPE:Armor.Shield	PLUS:2			VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.139	PREMULT:2,[PRETYPE:1,Enhancement],[PRETYPE:1,Armor,Shield]	DR:5/Bludgeoning or Piercing	SPROP:This armor is magically enhanced to turn away slashing weapons such as axes and most swords. The wearer gains damage reduction 5/bludgeoning or piercing. If a single shield or suit of armor has two of the three blocking armor qualities (axeblock, hammerblock, and spearblock), it grants its owner just 5 points of damage reduction by whatever damage type appears twice. For example, a +1 chain shirt with the axeblock (DR 5/bludgeoning or piercing) and hammerblock (DR 5/piercing or slashing) special abilities only provides DR 5/piercing. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, polymorph any object; Price +2 bonus.	ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Hammerblock		KEY:HAMMERBLOCK	TYPE:Armor.Shield	PLUS:2			VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.140	PREMULT:2,[PRETYPE:1,Enhancement],[PRETYPE:1,Armor,Shield]	DR:5/Piercing or Slashing	SPROP:Armor with this quality functions the same as axeblock armor, except that it provides damage reduction of 5/piercing or slashing. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, polymorph any object; Price +2 bonus.																																																																					ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Spearblock		KEY:SPEARBLOCK	TYPE:Armor.Shield	PLUS:2			VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.140	PREMULT:2,[PRETYPE:1,Enhancement],[PRETYPE:1,Armor,Shield]	DR:5/Bludgeoning or Slashing	SPROP:Armor with this quality functions the same as axeblock armor, except that it provides damage reduction of 5/bludgeoning or slashing.

###Block: Weapon abilities
# Modifier Name	Unique Key			Type					Plus		Visible		Source Page		Multiple Requirements																	Required Type							Prohibited Type	Required Wield Category	Special Property																																																																																																																			Apply to both heads
Blood Seeking	KEY:BLOODSEEKING_WEAP	TYPE:Ammunition.Weapon.Ranged	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	PREMULT:1,[PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Ammunition],[PREMULT:2,[PRETYPE:3,Enhancement,Weapon,Ranged],[!PRETYPE:1,Thrown]]																	SPROP:Weapons with the blood seeking ability often have strange-looking sights on them. Ammunition fired from blood seeking weapons flies around cover if necessary to strike a living creature, negating any bonus to Armor Class the target might have due to intervening cover. The shooter can even fire at a target with full cover, but she must know the target is there, there must be an unobstructed path for the ammunition to reach the target, and the target still has total concealment (and thus a 50%% miss chance). The blood seeking ability doesn't function against plants, oozes, undead, and constructs. Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, arcane eye; Price +1 bonus.		ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Deflecting		KEY:DEFLECTING_WEAP	TYPE:Weapon.Melee			PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.134																					PRETYPE:3,Enhancement,Weapon,Melee											SPROP:If you're wielding a deflecting weapon of your size or one size larger, you can try to knock projectiles aimed at you out of the air. Once per round when you would normally be hit by a ranged weapon, you may make a DC 20 Reflex saving throw (if the ranged weapon has a magical enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount). If you succeed, the ranged weapon or projectile deflects away harmlessly. You must be aware of the attack and not flatfooted. Only melee weapons can have this ability. Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, entropic shield; Price +1 bonus.																			ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Disarming		KEY:DISARMING_WEAP	TYPE:Weapon				PLUS:2	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.134																					PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Weapon					!PRETYPE:1,Thrown					SPROP:This weapon ability functions differently depending on whether it's applied to a melee weapon or a ranged weapon. If applied to a melee weapon, the disarming ability eliminates the opponent's bonuses for both weapon size and two-handed weapons. If applied to a ranged weapon, the disarming ability makes possible a disarm attack; you can shoot a weapon out of someone's hand. The relative weapon sizes don't matter for a ranged disarm attempt, but the defender gains a +4 bonus for wielding a weapon in two hands. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, telekinesis; Price +2 bonus.																ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Exit Wound		KEY:EXITWOUND_WEAP	TYPE:Ammunition.Weapon.Ranged	PLUS:2	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.134																					PRETYPE:1,Enhancement	PRETYPE:1,Ammunition,Ranged	!PRETYPE:1,Thrown					SPROP:Weapons with the exit wound ability propel their ammunition entirely through living targets they hit. This effect deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. The weapon or projectile continues in a straight line beyond the original target. Targets in that path are attacked using the same attack roll as the original target; these additional targets gain a +4 bonus to AC for each previous target in the path. When an exit wound weapon or projectile hits an object, it stops. The exit wound ability can be applied to any ranged weapon; projectile weapons so enhanced bestow the ability on their ammunition. Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Melf's acid arrow; Price +2 bonus.	ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Explosive		KEY:EXPLOSIVE_WEAP	TYPE:Ammunition.Weapon.Melee	PLUS:2	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.134																					PRETYPE:1,Enhancement	PRETYPE:1,Ammunition,Melee	!PRETYPE:1,Thrown					SPROP:Always slightly warm to the touch, weapons with the explosive ability deal extra damage to anyone near the intended target. Each successful hit with an explosive weapon deals 2d4 points of damage to all targets in a 5-foot burst (Reflex DC 15 half), including the original target. The explosive ability can be applied to any melee weapon (though the wielder may be subject to the extra damage) or ranged weapon. Projectile weapons so enhanced bestow the explosive ability on their ammunition. Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shatter; Price +2 bonus (+3 bonus for ranged weapons).															ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Explosive		KEY:EXPLOSIVE_RNG		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged		PLUS:3	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.134																					PRETYPE:3,Enhancement,Weapon,Ranged											SPROP:Always slightly warm to the touch, weapons with the explosive ability deal extra damage to anyone near the intended target. Each successful hit with an explosive weapon deals 2d4 points of damage to all targets in a 5-foot burst (Reflex DC 15 half), including the original target. The explosive ability can be applied to any melee weapon (though the wielder may be subject to the extra damage) or ranged weapon. Projectile weapons so enhanced bestow the explosive ability on their ammunition. Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, shatter; Price +2 bonus (+3 bonus for ranged weapons).															ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Knockback		KEY:KNOCKBACK_WEAP	TYPE:Ammunition.Weapon.Ranged	PLUS:3	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.135																					PRETYPE:1,Enhancement	PRETYPE:1,Ammunition,Ranged	!PRETYPE:1,Thrown					SPROP:Knockback weapons often emit a low, almost inaudible hum when drawn. Whenever a knockback weapon hits its target, it initiates a bull rush attack in addition to dealing normal damage. To resolve the bull rush attempt, treat the projectile as a Medium creature with a +8 Strength bonus. The projectile doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, and it always tries to push the target as far back as possible. Only ranged weapons can have the knockback ability, and they bestow it on their ammunition. Moderate evocation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Bigby's forceful hand; Price +3 bonus.																	ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Last Resort		KEY:LASTRESORT_WEAP	TYPE:Weapon.Melee			PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.135																					PRETYPE:3,Enhancement,Weapon,Melee							PREWIELD:1,Light		SPROP:A melee weapon (usually a dagger) with the last resort ability is particularly effective in a grapple. Its wielder doesn't take the -4 penalty for attacking with a weapon while grappling, and the weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage in a grapple for every size category the target is bigger than the wielder. For example, a halfling armed with a +1 last resort dagger would deal an extra 2d6 points of damage when being grappled by an ogre. Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, freedom of movement; Price +1 bonus.																										ASSIGNTOALL:NO
