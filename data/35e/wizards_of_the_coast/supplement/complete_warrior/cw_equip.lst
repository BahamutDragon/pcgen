Armor of the Unending Hunt							PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Chainmail	TYPE:Armor.Medium.Suit.Standard												COST:21500	COST:150	WT:20	WT:40			ACCHECK:-5												EQMOD:MITHRAL_ARMR_MED.PLUS2A	EQMOD:STEEL				MAXDEX:2											SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SOURCEPAGE:p.124	SPELLFAILURE:30		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|5|TYPE=Armor								SPROP:This mithral +2 chainmail armor was built by the elves for rangers on long-range patrols. In addition to its protective qualities, it provides the wearer with immunity to fatigue and exhaustion. Moderate Abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, restoration	SPROP:This armor is made of interlocking metal rings. It includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. Several layers of mail are hung over vital areas. Most of the armor's weight hangs from the shoulders, making chainmail uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. The suit includes gauntlets.

# Weapon
Burrowing Arrow														TYPE:Enhancement.Ammunition.SpecificArrow.Individual									COST:167			WT:0							BASEITEM:Arrow								EQMOD:MWORKW.PLUS1W.STEEL.WOOD								MODS:NO								SOURCEPAGE:p.135																				SPROP:This +1 arrow sticks into its target on a successful hit and embeds itself in the wound. A burrowing arrow must be pulled out before natural healing can occur, and this removal deals a further 1d8 points of damage. If the target receives magical healing, the burrowing arrow immediately deals 1d8 points of damage as the magic forces it out of the wound. Faint necromancy; CL 4th
Lance of the Last Rider		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lance							TYPE:Enhancement.Weapon.Melee.Martial.Reach.Specific.Piercing.Lance						COST:8306			WT:10											CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:MWORKW.PLUS1W.WOOD			WIELD:TwoHanded				MODS:NO			REACHMULT:2		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.135																				SPROP:When mounted, free bull rush against attempt when hit a mounted foe.	SPROP:Whenever the wielder of this +1 lance charges a mounted foe from the back of a steed, the weapon allows a free bull rush attempt on a successful hit. If the bull rush attempt succeeds, the enemy rider moves back, but the enemy's mount stays where it is. Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, bull's strength
Oglien's Final Answer		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Chain (Spiked)						TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Reach.Finesseable.Standard.Piercing.Chain.Magic					COST:26325			WT:10		SLOTS:2								CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:2d4	EQMOD:PLUS2W	EQMOD:STEEL			WIELD:TwoHanded								REACHMULT:2		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SOURCEPAGE:p.115										BONUS:SKILL|Perform (Weapon Drill)|5	SPROP:This +2 spiked chain has a glittering sheen, but most spellcasters don't identify it as magic due to the persistent nondetection effect on it. A DC 25 Spellcraft check is required for a spellcaster to detect the magic of Oglien's final answer. The weapon gives its wielder a +5 bonus on Perform (weapon drill) checks. (See the section on skills near the end of Chapter 3.) Oglien, a noted gladiator from a bygone age, used his "final answer" to get an edge in the arena. Since his death, the weapon has passed from gladiator to gladiator, with many unaware of its magical nature. Moderate transmutation and abjuration; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, nondetection	SPROP:A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against adjacent foe. Because the chain can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped. When using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). You can use the Weapon Finesse feat (page 102) to apply your Dexterity modifiers instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon for you.

# Wondrous Item
Bracers of Dawn														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Bracer													COST:26000			WT:1																														MODS:NO								SOURCEPAGE:p.135																				SPROP:These bejeweled bracers have a miniscule lens-and-dial contraption mounted on the exterior of one bracer of the pair. When the dial is turned to the left, the bracers appear normal. When the wearer turns the dial to the middle position (a move action), a beam of light emerges from the lens, illuminating the surroundings as a bullseye lantern. Four times per day, the wearer can turn the dial to the right position as a standard action and aim the lens at a target, unleashing a beam of searing light that deals 3d8 points of damage to most creatures, 6d6 points of damage to undead, and 6d8 points of damage to creatures with light sensitivity. The dial returns to the middle position after each searing light. Even though only one of the pair contains the lens-anddial apparatus, both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective. Moderate evocation, CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, searing light
Gauntlet of the Dwarven Forge												TYPE:Equip.Gauntlet.Glove.Magic												COST:24000			WT:3																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.135																				SPROP:This iron gauntlet extends to the elbow and is always cool to its wearer's touch. When its command word is spoken, a gauntlet of the dwarven forge glows red-hot for 10 rounds, illuminating everything within 10 feet as if by torchlight. Anyone else touched by the gauntlet during this time takes 1d6+10 points of fire damage. The wearer of a gauntlet of the dwarven forge takes half damage from fire-based attacks while the gauntlet is glowing. Fire attacks that allow Reflex saves for half damage deal the wearer no damage if he makes his save. Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, fire shield
Gauntlet of Lassitude													TYPE:Equip.Gauntlet.Glove.Magic												COST:27000			WT:2																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.135																				SPROP:This leather glove bound in brass magically transforms to match the hand shape of its owner, and thus it can be worn on either hand. With a successful melee touch attack, the gauntlet of lassitude slows the target for 5 rounds (Will DC 14 negates). Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, slow
Gauntlet of Utterdeath													TYPE:Equip.Gauntlet.Glove.Magic												COST:96000			WT:2																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.136																				SPROP:This spiked gauntlet of jet-black steel smells faintly of brimstone. If the wearer succeeds on a melee touch attack, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be reduced to a pile of smoldering cinders. If the Fortitude save succeeds, the target instead takes 10d6 points of damage. A gauntlet of utterdeath is usable three times per day. Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, destruction
Sacred Scabbard														TYPE:Equip.Scabbard.Magic.Container								CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon=1	COST:4400			WT:1																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.136																				SPROP:This item has a variable appearance. When first found, there is a 25%% chance it looks like a dagger sheath, a 25%% chance it looks like an axe case, and a 50%% chance it looks like some sort of sword sheath. A user quickly discovers, however, that a sacred scabbard can change shape to fit whatever dagger, sword, or axe is touched to it, even making allowances for double weapons. This scabbard keeps any weapon carried in it clean and sharp. In addition, up to three times per day, the user may place a weapon in the scabbard, utter a command word, and invoke bless weapon on the weapon inside. Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, bless weapon
Standard of Courage													TYPE:Equip.Standard.Magic													COST:15000			WT:1																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.136																				SPROP:For a standard of courage to be effective, it must be affixed to a two-handed hafted weapon such as a halberd or a lance. The bearer of the standard and any allies within 30 feet of the item gain a +4 morale bonus against fear effects. Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, remove fear
Standard of Heroism													TYPE:Equip.Standard.Magic													COST:40000			WT:1																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.136																				SPROP:This standard functions as a standard of courage, except that the standard bearer and any allies within 30 feet of the item gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. Faint enchantment and abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, heroism, remove fear
Standard of No Retreat													TYPE:Equip.Standard.Magic													COST:145000			WT:1																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.136																				SPROP:This standard functions as a standard of courage, except that it also prevents outward extradimensional travel within 30 feet, just as if creatures were subjected to a dimensional anchor spell. Creatures trying to flee from the standard's area must succeed on a DC 19 Will save, or their attempt to flee fails. A standard of no retreat doesn't prevent creatures from using extradimensional travel to enter the area, just to leave it. Summoned creatures within the standard's area still disappear when the spell that brought them here ends. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, dimensional anchor, remove fear

Buckler-Axe, Dwarven	KEY:Buckler Axe (Dwarven)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Buckler Axe (Dwarven)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Slashing.Light.Dwarven.Axe																			COST:20	WT:4							CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M																													SPROP:Penalty when wielded	SPROP:At first glance the dwarven buckler-axe appears similar to a standard buckler, but this weapon has enlarged bladelike edges at its top and bottom, allowing the wielder to swing it like an axe. Thus, in addition to its obvious protective qualities, it proves a capable off-hand weapon or emergency weapon when disarmed. A dwarven buckler-axe grants its wielder a +1 shield bonus to Armor Class. As with any shield, when you attack with a dwarven buckler-axe, you do not get the shield bonus to your AC. The buckler-axe also provides a -1 armor check penalty and incurs a 5%% arcane spell failure chance for its wielder. Like a spiked shield, a buckler-axe can be enhanced as a weapon, as a shield, or both, but such enhancements must be paid for and applied separately.
Lightblade, Elven		KEY:Lightblade (Elven)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lightblade (Elven)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.Light.Elven.Sword																			COST:50	WT:1							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.157																										SPROP:This rapierlike weapon is the size of a short sword, but weighs only as much as a dagger. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, flexible blade slips easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs of a foe. Some elf nobles carry a lightblade-often decorated with intricate filigree and tiny gemstones-as a sign of their station, even if they aren't proficient in its use.
Tortoise Blade, Gnome	KEY:Tortoise Blade (Gnome)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tortoise Blade (Gnome)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.Light.Gnomish.Dagger																			COST:10	WT:3							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.158																										SPROP:This contraption is designed to be used by a gnome in his or her off hand. It is particularly useful in cramped tunnels or warrens where swinging a weapon is difficult or impossible. It looks like a turtle shell strapped to the wielder's wrist, with a daggerlike blade jutting out where the wielder's fingers should be. A tortoise blade grants a +1 shield bonus to Armor Class. As with any shield, when you attack with a tortoise blade you do not get the shield bonus to your AC. A tortoise blade also provides a -1 armor check penalty and incurs a 5%% arcane spell failure chance for its wielder. Like a spiked shield, a tortoise blade can be enhanced as a weapon, as a shield, or both, but such enhancements must be paid for and applied separately.
Maul									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Maul				TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Martial.Melee.Standard.Bludgeoning.TwoHanded.Mace																		COST:15	WT:20							CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d10				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.157												BONUS:WEAPON|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Maul)		SPROP:A maul is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat). A character can use a maul two-handed as a martial weapon.
Pick, Dire			KEY:Pick (Dire)			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Pick (Dire)		TYPE:Weapon.Martial.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Pick																			COST:30	WT:12							CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.157												BONUS:WEAPON|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Pick (Dire))	SPROP:A dire pick resembles a heavy pick, but with a longer shaft and a more massive head. A dire pick is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat). A character can use a dire pick two-handed as a martial weapon.
Scourge								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Scourge			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Slashing.OneHanded.Whip																				COST:20	WT:2							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.158																										SPROP:+2 bonus on opposed attack roll when disarming an opponent	SPROP:This multitailed, barbed whip is often dipped in a poison delivered via injury. You get a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack fails) with this weapon.
Thinblade, Elven		KEY:Thinblade (Elven)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Thinblade (Elven)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.OneHanded.Elven.Sword																			COST:100	WT:3							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.158																										SPROP:This rapierlike weapon is the size of a longsword, but much lighter. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, flexible blade slips easily into the seams of armor, or between the ribs of an enemy. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an elven thinblade.
Warmace								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Warmace			TYPE:Weapon.Martial.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Bludgeoning.TwoHanded.Mace																		COST:25	WT:10							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d12				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.158				BONUS:COMBAT|AC|-1|PREEQUIPPRIMARY:1,Warmace	BONUS:WEAPON|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Warmace)		SPROP:Anyone wielding a warmace takes a -1 penalty to Armor Class because the weight of the weapon makes it difficult to recover quickly from swinging it. A warmace is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat). A character can use a warmace two-handed as a martial weapon.
Greatspear								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatspear			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Reach.Spear																		COST:25	WT:9							CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:2d6				EQMOD:WOOD					WIELD:TwoHanded					RANGE:10	REACHMULT:2		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.156																										SPROP:This broad-bladed spear has a long, flat blade, and is too heavy to wield properly without proficiency.
Hammer, Double		KEY:Hammer (Double)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Hammer (Double)		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Double.Standard.Bludgeoning.Hammer								ALTTYPE:Melee.Exotic.Bludgeoning.Hammer						COST:70	WT:18		SLOTS:2				CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	ALTCRITMULT:x3	ALTCRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:STEEL		ALTEQMOD:STEEL	WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.156																										SPROP:A double hammer is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons as if you were attacking with a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. (See page 160 of the Player's Handbook for details on fighting with two weapons.)
Lajatang								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lajatang			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Slashing.TwoHanded.Double.Quarterstaff					ALTTYPE:Melee.Exotic.Slashing.Quarterstaff					COST:90	WT:7		SLOTS:2				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	ALTCRITMULT:x2	ALTCRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:WOOD		ALTEQMOD:WOOD	WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.157																										SPROP:The lajatang is a staff with a crescent-shaped blade at each end. A lajatang is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons: a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see page 160 of the Player's Handbook). A monk who is proficient with the lajatang can treat it as a special monk weapon, as described in the monk class description (page 40 of the Player's Handbook). Each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of the flurry of blows ability, similar to how the quarterstaff works.
Mancatcher								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mancatcher			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Bludgeoning.TwoHanded.Double.Reach																		COST:20	WT:8							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded							REACHMULT:2		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.157																										SPROP:City guards and others who prefer to capture their opponents unharmed use the mancatcher. A wielder who hits a target of its size or one size category smaller than it with a mancatcher can immediately attempt to grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity. Any grapple check you make using a mancatcher includes the mancatcher's enhancement bonus (if any) and any other bonuses you might have on attack rolls with the weapon (such as from the Weapon Focus feat). If you grapple a target with a mancatcher, you are considered grappling, but unless your target can reach you, he can't attempt to attack you, damage you, or pin you. You can escape the grapple automatically by releasing the target as a standard action. In addition to the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of a mancatcher can attempt to force his target to the ground (the equivalent of a trip attack, though no attack roll is necessary). The mancatcher is a reach weapon and cannot be used against adjacent opponents.
Poleaxe, Heavy		KEY:Poleaxe (Heavy)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Poleaxe (Heavy)		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.Slashing.TwoHanded.Reach.Polearm																	COST:20	WT:15							CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:2d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded							REACHMULT:2		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.157																										SPROP:A heavy poleaxe has reach; you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe. Normally, you strike with the heavy poleaxe's axe head, but the spike on the end is useful against charging opponents. If you use a ready action to set a heavy poleaxe against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging creature.

Dart, Blowgun (10)	KEY:Dart (Blowgun/10)									TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Dart																									COST:10	WT:5				BASEQTY:10																	EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD																		SOURCEPAGE:G	SOURCEPAGE:p.156																							SPROP:A blowgun dart resembles a lightweight, undersized arrow. You don't apply your Strength modifier to damage with a blowgun dart. A blowgun dart can't effectively be used as a melee weapon. Blowgun darts come in a leather pouch that holds 10 darts. A dart that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50%% chance to be destroyed or lost.
Dart, Blowgun		KEY:Dart (Blowgun)									TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Dart																									COST:1	WT:0.5																					EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD																		SOURCEPAGE:G	SOURCEPAGE:p.156																							SPROP:A blowgun dart resembles a lightweight, undersized arrow. You don't apply your Strength modifier to damage with a blowgun dart. A blowgun dart can't effectively be used as a melee weapon. Blowgun darts come in a leather pouch that holds 10 darts. A dart that hits its target is destroyed; one that misses has a 50%% chance to be destroyed or lost.
Blowgun, Greater		KEY:Blowgun (Greater)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Blowgun (Greater)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Container.Projectile.Blowgun												CONTAINS:UNLIM|Dart=1	COST:15	WT:2																												WIELD:TwoHanded												SOURCEPAGE:p.155																										SPROP:Like its smaller cousin (see page 145 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), the greater blowgun is often used to deliver poison. The darts it fires are larger than blowgun needles, but smaller than a thrown dart. These darts deal damage in addition to delivering poison. A greater blowgun requires two hands to use or reload. Loading a blowgun is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A greater blowgun has a maximum range of five range increments.
Bolas, Barbed		KEY:Bolas (Barbed)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Bolas			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Bludgeoning.Standard.Thrown.Bolas																				COST:10	WT:3							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:WOOD												RANGE:10				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.155																										SPROP:This weapon is similar to a normal set of bolas, except that its weighted balls are studded with hooked barbs and thus deal lethal (not nonlethal) damage. Because the barbed bolas can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of barbed bolas. For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, barbed bolas are treated as if they were bolas. Thus, if you have Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bolas), you are also profi- cient with barbed bolas.
Boomerang								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Boomerang			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Bludgeoning.OneHanded.Thrown.Boomerang																	COST:10	WT:2							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:WOOD					WIELD:OneHanded					RANGE:20				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.155																										SPROP:The boomerang is a curved throwing stick that returns to its thrower if it misses its target. To catch a returning boomerang, the thrower must make an attack roll (as if he were throwing the boomerang) and hit AC 10. Failure indicates the boomerang lands in a randomly determined square adjacent to the thrower (if the thrower is proficient) or 1d4 squares away in a random direction (if not proficient).
Greatbow								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatbow			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Container.Projectile.Bow.Greatbow											CONTAINS:UNLIM|Arrow=1	COST:150	WT:6		SLOTS:2				CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d10				EQMOD:WOOD					WIELD:TwoHanded					RANGE:120				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.156												BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|min(STR,0)									SPROP:You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A greatbow sized for a Medium character is 6 feet or more in length when strung. A greatbow is too un wieldy to use while mounted. Like other bows, if you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when using a greatbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite greatbow (see below) but not a regular greatbow.
Greatbow, Composite	KEY:Greatbow (Composite)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatbow			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Container.Projectile.Bow.Greatbow.Composite									CONTAINS:UNLIM|Arrow=1	COST:200	WT:6		SLOTS:2				CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d10				EQMOD:WOOD					WIELD:TwoHanded	MODS:REQUIRED		RANGE:130				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.156												BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|min(STR,0)									SPROP:You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A composite greatbow is too unwieldy to use while mounted. A composite greatbow sized for a Medium character is 6 feet or more in length when strung. Composite greatbows follow all of the normal rules for composite bows, including strength ratings. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 200 gp to the cost.
