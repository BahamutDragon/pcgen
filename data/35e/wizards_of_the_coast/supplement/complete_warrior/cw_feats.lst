You never need to make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and even controlling a mount not trained for combat doesn't require an action). Normal: Without this feat, you take a -5 penalty on Ride checks without a saddle, and you must make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and controlling a mount not trained for combat requires a move action).
Perfect Two-Weapon Fighting	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Greater Two-Weapon Fighting,Improved Two-Weapon Fighting,Two-Weapon Fighting	PREPCLEVEL:MIN=21										PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dex 25, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Fighting.	DESC:You can attack with your off-hand weapon as frequently as with your primary weapon.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:When making a full attack, you can make as many attacks with your off-hand weapon as with your primary weapon, using the same base attack bonus. For example, a character with this feat and a base attack bonus of +18/+13/+8/+3 could make four attacks per round with his primary weapon and four attacks per round with his off-hand weapon, using the sazme set of base attack bonuses. You still take the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons. Normal: Without this feat, you can only make a single attack with an off-hand weapon during a full attack (or two attacks with an off-hand weapon if you have Improved Two- Weapon Fighting, or three attacks with an off-hand weapon if you have Greater Two-Weapon Fighting).
Wield Oversized Weapon		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Epic	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Monkey Grip												PREPCLEVEL:MIN=21							PRESTAT:1,STR=25	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 25, Monkey Grip*, base attack bonus +21.								DESC:You can use larger than normal weapons with ease.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.153	BENEFIT:You can treat any weapon as if it were one size category smaller than normal and one category "lighter" for the purpose of determining the amount of effort it takes to wield. For instance, a halfling with this feat could wield a Medium short sword as a Small light weapon, or a human could wield an ogre's Large greatclub as a Medium twohanded weapon. The weapon still deals its normal amount of damage. Normal: You may only wield weapons of your size without penalty.																																											PRETOTALAB:21
