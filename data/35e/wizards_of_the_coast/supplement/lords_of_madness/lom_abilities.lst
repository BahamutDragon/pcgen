Activating and deactivating stonewalking is a free action. If you are still burrowing when you run out of time, you are immediately ejected into the nearest open surface large enough to contain you. Distance is not a factor, but the ejection is quite painful and forces you to make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per 5 feet traveled to reach the open area) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.
