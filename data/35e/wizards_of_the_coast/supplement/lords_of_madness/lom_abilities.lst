Abolisher Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Abolisher	BONUS:VAR|AnimalCompanionLVL|classlevel("Abolisher")	DESC:Your Abolisher levels contribute to your Animal Companion
Winds of Nature's Grace	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, you gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks from aberrations. The bonus increases to match your Charisma bonus, if any (minimum of +2) when you use wild shape or other magic to assume the form of an animal, elemental, or plant.

Crystals of Nature's Wrath	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESC:At 5th level and higher, your wild shape natural attacks are enhanced with jagged crystals. These crystals are harmless to most creatures, but to aberrations they cause terrible welts and acidlike burns. An aberration struck by one of your natural weapons must make a Fortitude save (DC %1 modifier) or become sickened for 1 minute. An aberration that makes its saving throw is immune to this effect for the duration of that use of wild shape.|!)+classlevel("Abolisher")+CHA
Waves of Nature's Purity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESC:Beginning at 7th level, you can create a rippling aura of white vapor that spreads in a 20-foot radius. The vapor does not obscure vision, and it is cool and refreshing against the skin of nonaberrations. Against aberrations, the waves of nature’s purity are foul and unsettling. An affected aberration must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + abolisher level + Cha modifi er) each round or become nauseated for that round. You can use this ability once per day, and the power lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifi er (minimum 1 round). Activating this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Fires of Nature's Rage		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESC: A 10th level, you can infuse your wild shape form with fl ickering ghostly fi re three times per day. The fi res of nature’s rage burn any aberration that comes in contact with them. Your natural attacks do an extra 3d6 points of fi re damage against aberrations, and an aberration that hits you, even with a weapon, takes 3d6 points of fi re damage. You can activate the fi res of nature’s wrath as a free action, as long as you are in wild shape form. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each activation lasts for 1 round.
