On the following round, its hit points drop to –1, and on the third round, it dies. Any effect that returns a drowning character to positive hit points wakens the creature and allows it to cough up the water in its lungs. Otherwise, only a DC 15 Heal check can empty the creature’s lungs of water and save it from a watery death.

The user no longer rolls to hit a target with the ray. Instead, any creatures caught inthe cone-shaped area must make a DC 15 Refl ex save to avoid the effect of the ray entirely. Each target in the area that fails to save is affected as if struck fully by the ray. This widening magic dilutes the original strength of the ray; creatures affected by the cone gain a +2 bonus on any saving throws made to resist or negate the actual effect of the ray. When widened, rays that normally affect objects (such as a disintegrate ray) now affect only creatures, unless the ray deals some form of energy damage, in which case objects automatically make their saving throw against the damage caused by the attack.  Shatters after 9 uses.

Inksac						TYPE:Graft.Aboleth		COST:9000			DESC:Spray ink 1/min as a free action which acts as Darkness when underwater.
Mucus Projector				TYPE:Graft.Aboleth		COST:36000		DESC:This graft  consists of a large, fl eshy sac with a tubelike extension. It is typically grafted onto a creature’s back so the tube can extend up over a shoulder. A creature with a mucus projector can activate it once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. When activated, it contracts violently and sprays a thin stream of aboleth mucus out of the tube. The creaturemust make a ranged touch attack to strike its intended target, which must be within 30 feet. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 grafted creature’s HD + grafted creature’s Con modifi er) or begin to transform as if struck by an aboleth’s slime (see page 8 of the Monster Manual). A mucus projector works equally well on the surface or underwater. 
Waterjet	TYPE:Graft.Aboleth	COST:2500	DESC:This long, thin tube is normally grafted onto a creature’s back. The grafted creature can use this graft once per minute while swimming to double its normal swim speed for 1 round.

The recipient gains a –4 penalty on Disable Device, Open Lock, and Sleight of Hand checks, but gains a burrow speed of 20 feet. The creature can even burrow through solid stone or any other material with hardness of no more than 8. The claws allow the creature to deal lethal damage with its unarmed strikes. Illithids gift thralls with these grafts when they need to expand a cavern’s size or dig new tunnels through the stony ground.  
Darksight Eyes			TYPE:Graft.Illithid	COST:24000	VISION:Darkvision(60')	DESC:Grants Darkvision
Mind Blast Relay		TYPE:Graft.Illithid	COST:50000	DESC:This strange graft is implanted into the depths of the grafted creature’s brain. The graft gives the creature complete immunity to mind blasts. Further, any mind fl ayer within 60 feet of a creature with a mind blast relay graft can automatically detect the graft when it uses telepathy on that creature. A mind fl ayer can then choose to relay its mind blast attack into that creature by activating its own mind blast. Once the mind blast is relayed, the mind fl ayer can choose to either allow the mind blast to manifest (in which case it does so in a 20-foot-radius blast centered on the grafted creature) or to relay it to a new creature with a mind blast relay within 20 feet of the current creature. A mind fl ayer can continue to relay its mind blast as a free action again and again until it gets to the mind blast relay it desires, at which point the creature allows it to manifest. Each time a mind blast is relayed, the DC to save against its effect is reduced by 2. A mind fl ayer must maintain line of sight to each creature in the chain of mind blast relays, but otherwise the only practical limit to the usefulness of this graft is the number of relays available and the original save DC of the illithid’s mind blast.
