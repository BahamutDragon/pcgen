Permeable Form						COMPS:V					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3	CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round		DESC:By altering the essential nature of the matter composing your body, you make yourself incorporeal for a brief time. While incorporeal, you can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, you have a 50% chance to ignore damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). You can enter or pass through solid objects as described under the incorporeal subtype on page 310 of the Monster Manual. Tsochar spellcasters sometimes use this spell to quickly exit an inhabited creature without causing damage to the victim. You cannot attack while in this state, but you can perform other actions as your incorporeal nature allows. Casting this spell is an immediate action. You can cast it even when it’s not your turn. You can only take one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn. 
Whispercast							COMPS:V					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2	CASTTIME:1 swift action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round		DESC:The next spell you cast can be cast as a purely mental action, provided that it is of 5th level or lower and that you can whisper. It requires no somatic or material components, unless the spell normally requires a focus or an expensive material component (any component worth more than 1 gp). If the spell does require a focus or an expensive component, you can still whispercast it as long as you have the focus or expensive component on your person—the magic of whispercast causes the focus to be used or the expensive component to be consumed normally, without you having to handle or manipulate it. If you do not cast a second spell while whispercast is in effect, you gain no benefi t from casting whispercast. Casting this spell is a swift action. It does not require a move action or standard action, but you can take only one swift, immediate, or quickened action per turn. Tsochari spellcasters use this spell to permit spellcasting while they inhabit other creatures. It is also useful for grappled spellcasters.
