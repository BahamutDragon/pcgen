# Spell Name		Unique Key				Classes of caster						School			Sub-School			Descriptor			Components			Casting Time			Range			Target Area or Effect										Duration						Save Info							Spell Resistance		Source Page		Description
Armored Vermin							CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=4					SCHOOL:Transmutation									COMPS:V, S, DF; Drow	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:Up to three vermin, no two of which are more than 30 ft. apart	DURATION:1 round/level (D)			SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.60	DESC:You cause the exoskeletons of up to three vermin to harden to the strength of steel. The spell increases the vermin's natural armor bonus by 2. This bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 7th, to a maximum of +6 at caster level 19th. The enhancement bonus provided by armored vermin stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A vermin with no natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.
Bebilith Blessing							CLASSES:Cleric=5						SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Chaos|Evil	COMPS:V, S, DF		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature								DURATION:1 round/level				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless); see text	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:You infuse a target with the essence of a bebilith (MM 42), causing it to gain the mandibles and claws of this demon. The target gains two primary claw attacks (in addition to its normal claw attacks, if any) and a secondary bite attack (replacing its normal bite attack). The claws deal 1d6 points of damage, and the bite deals 1d8 points (assuming Medium size). If it is wielding a weapon, the target can attack with either a single claw or a bite as a secondary attack. The target can sunder objects with its claw attacks as if it had the Improved Sunder feat. The target's bite attack carries a poison (injury; Fort save equal to the spell's save DC; 1d6 Con/2d6 Con). The target of this spell is also treated as an outsider of the evil subtype in addition to its normal type and subtypes.
Combat Readiness							CLASSES:Assassin,Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Divination										COMPS:V			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched									DURATION:1 minute/level				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:The touched creature gains a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks for every three caster levels you have (minimum +1, maximum +6). In addition, if the target is flanked, its opponents gain no bonus on attack rolls (but still gain any other benefits derived from flanking, such as extra sneak attack damage)
Dominate Vermin							CLASSES:Cleric,Druid=3					SCHOOL:Transmutation									COMPS:V, S, DF; Drow	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One vermin										DURATION:1 minute/level				SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:You invest your psyche into a single vermin creature, granting it your Intelligence. While it is so affected, you can direct it with simple commands such as "Attack," "Run," and "Fetch." Since you are in absolute control of the creature, it even follows suicidal commands. You can continue to direct the vermin as long as it remains within range. You need not see it to control it. Changing your instructions or giving a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. If the vermin is slain, your mind is forced out of the creature violently. The experience deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to you.
Dridershape								CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5				SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph					COMPS:V, S; Drow		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You											DURATION:1 round/level (D)															SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:You take on the form and abilities of a drider (MM 89). You gain 20 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration. You don't gain the drider's spellcasting ability, but you retain your own. (Spellcasting is subject to the drider's ability scores; for instance, you can't cast wizard spells above 5th level, since your new Intelligence is only 15). Any held objects remain held in the new form (other gear melds into the new form as normal). See page 59 for details of the polymorph subschool.
Engulfing Terror							CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=3			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation					COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 full round		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One gelatinous cube								DURATION:1 round/level				SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.61	DESC:Engulfing terror creates a gelatinous cube (MM 201) in a space you designate. The space must be large enough to accommodate the creature. If not, the spell automatically fails. Upon appearing, the cube acts on your turn, attacking the nearest living creature each round. You have no control over it and cannot direct it. The gelatinous cube remains until it is destroyed or has no remaining targets to attack, at which point it moves away in a random direction.
Magical Backlash							CLASSES:Bard,Hexblade,Sorcerer,Wizard=2		SCHOOL:Abjuration										COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One creature										DURATION:Instantaneous				SAVEINFO:Fortitude half					SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:Magical backlash causes any spells affecting the target to resonate painfully. For each spell currently in effect on the target (not counting magical backlash itself), magical backlash deals 2 points of damage per level of that spell. For example, a creature targeted by magical backlash that is under the effects of bull's strength, blur, and mage armor spells would take 4 points of damage for bull's strength, 4 for blur, and 2 more for mage armor for a total of 10 points of damage.
Shadow Double							CLASSES:Assassin=1|Hexblade,Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Shadow						COMPS:V			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One shadowy duplicate								DURATION:1 round/level				SAVEINFO:Will disbelief					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:You create a shadowy duplicate of yourself at a place you indicate within range. The shadow double attacks any adjacent target (regardless of the weapon it appears to wield), as you desire, starting in the round when you cast the spell. It attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + the modifier for your spell save DCs. Each hit deals 1 point of Strength damage to the target. The first time a target is hit, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect; this negates the damage and renders it immune to further attacks by the shadow double. The shadow double occupies a space identical to yours. It is not incorporeal, and thus can't share a space with another creature or object. It can provide a flanking bonus against any creature that hasn't yet saved successfully against it. The shadow double can strike incorporeal creatures, but not ethereal creatures. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to direct the shadow double to attack any other target. To attack this new target, the shadow double can move to any new legal space within 30 feet (it moves by instantaneous teleportation). If it is not commanded to switch targets, it continues to attack the same target. A shadow double can be attacked. It has an Armor Class equal to 10 + your size modifier + a deflection bonus equal to the modifier for your spell save DCs, and has one-fifth of your full normal hit points. If the shadow double is reduced to 0 hit points, or if you create a second shadow double when the first still exists, the spell ends.
Shadow Shroud							CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Darkness	COMPS:V			CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You											DURATION:1 round/level (D)															SOURCEPAGE:p.62	DESC:This spell negates any penalties or other harmful effects imposed by your light blindness or light vulnerability. You also gain a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks made in areas of shadow or darkness. As with any darkness spell, the effect is suppressed if you enter the area of a light spell of 3rd level or higher.
Snuff The Light							CLASSES:Assassin,Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Transmutation									COMPS:S			CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One nonmagical light source							DURATION:Instantaneous or 1 round/level	SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:Snuff the light extinguishes a single nonmagical light source, such as a candle, torch, or lantern. Against alchemical light sources, such as sunrods, you suppress the light for 1 round per caster level.
Spider Form								CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3				SCHOOL:Transmutation	SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph					COMPS:V, S			CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You											DURATION:1 round/level (D)															SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:As lesser spider form, except you take on the form and abilities of a Large fiendish monstrous spider (MM 289). You are treated as having the spider's Hit Dice (4) for the purpose of adjudicating the special abilities gained from the fiendish template.

Yochlol Blessing							CLASSES:Cleric=4						SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Chaotic|Evil	COMPS:V, S, DF; Drow	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close		TARGETAREA:One living creature								DURATION:1 round/level				SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)			SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:You infuse a target with the vile power of a yochlol FC1, one of the demonic handmaidens of Lolth, causing its body to erupt with eight tendrils. As a full-round action, the target can make eight primary tentacle attacks (using its normal reach), each dealing 1d4 points of damage. These attacks can't be combined with any other weapon or natural weapon attacks. In addition, the target gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus (minimum +1, maximum +5) and resistance 10 to acid and electricity. The target of this spell is also treated as an outsider of the evil and shapechanger subtypes (in addition to its normal type and subtypes).
