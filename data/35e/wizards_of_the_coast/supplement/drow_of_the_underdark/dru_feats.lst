You spend one daily use of each spell-like ability used in this combination. Curtain of Darkness: You can expend one daily use of dancing lights and darkness to extinguish all nonmagical light sources within 100 feet. This is not a magical darkness effect; the fires (or other sources, such as sunrods) simply go out. This ability does not function on any flame larger than that of a torch or lantern, so it cannot be used to extinguish a burning building or as a defense against fire used as a weapon. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Mirror Image: You can expend one daily use of dancing lights and faerie fire to use mirror image (as the spell, except you gain only 1d4 images). See Invisibility: You can expend one daily use of darkness and faerie fire to use see invisibility (as the spell, except the duration is only 1 round per caster level).

DESC:You have mastered techniques of waging war when mounted on a monstrous spider (or similar vermin).																							SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:When riding monstrous vermin, you do not need to make any rolls or checks to remain mounted if your mount travels across walls or ceilings (though if you take damage when on a wall or ceiling, the DC of the check to remain mounted is 10 rather than 5). When your monstrous vermin mount makes a charge attack, you can spend a standard action to grant it a bonus on the attack roll and damage roll equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus. Normal: Riding a creature clinging to a wall or ceiling would require various checks depending on circumstances.
Master of Poisons			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																											DESC:You are highly trained and adept in the use of toxic substances.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:You can apply poison or oil to a weapon as a swift action, without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Special: A fighter can select Paralyzing Fists as a fighter bonus feat.
Poison Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																											DESC:You can mystically transfer a poison to the target of your spells.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:You can add a contact or injury poison as a material component to a melee touch spell you are casting. Doing this entails the same risk of poisoning yourself as applying poison to a weapon (DMG 296). The target of the spell, in addition to being subject to the normal effects of the spell, is also exposed to the poison. (A melee touch spell must deal damage to deliver the effect of an injury poison.) The dose of poison used as the component is expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the spell or poison successfully affects the target.

DESC:Instead of an animal, you bond with a monstrous spider.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.52	BENEFIT:You can select a monstrous spider as your animal companion. This spider gains all the benefits normally granted to animal companions. At 1st level, you can select a Tiny, Small, or Medium monstrous spider as your spider companion.

DESC:Through deft maneuvering, you unravel your opponent's defenses.

Umbral Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic																											DESC:You add the darkness descriptor to a spell you cast.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.52	BENEFIT:You can alter a burst-, emanation-, or spread-shaped spell so that it gains the darkness descriptor. The altered spell automatically dispels any spells with the light descriptor of the spell's level or lower whose effects overlap or are within the altered spell's area. For example, an umbral lightning bolt would dispel any ongoing light spell of 3rd level or lower in the area of the line. An umbral spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Vermin Trainer			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Drow, Handle Animal 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks.													DESC:Your service to the Spider Queen gives you insight into training vermin.

Normal: Without this feat, only animals and magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 can be handled and trained with the Handle Animal skill, and using Handle Animal on a magical beast is done with a �4 penalty on the check. Special: The size of vermin directly affects the ability of the trainer to instruct them (see page 46).
Verminfriend			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Drow.																						DESC:Thanks to your racial connection to their kind, vermin regard you as one of their own.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.53	BENEFIT:Whenever a vermin is about to attack you, you can attempt a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/4 the vermin's HD) as an immediate action.

DESC:You have learned to combine attacks with the favored weapons of the drow.

SOURCEPAGE:p.54	BENEFIT:Your sneak attack creates an aura of magical darkness that impedes your target's vision for 3 rounds. The target takes a �4 penalty on Spot checks and treats all other creatures as having concealment. Neither darkvision nor low-light vision pierces this effect, though the ability to see through magical darkness does. Any spell with the light descriptor suppresses the effect. Using this feat reduces your sneak attack damage by 2d6.
Sickening Strike			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Ambush		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Sneak attack +2d6.																				DESC:Your sneak attacks leave enemies reeling in pain.

DESC:You know where to place your sneak attacks to deliver a highly effective poisoned strike.

DESC:You can channel divine energy to remove yourself from a dangerous situation.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.54	BENEFIT:You can spend three turn or rebuke undead attempts to teleport to any point up to 30 feet away within line of sight.

DESC:You can channel negative energy to empower vermin.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.54	BENEFIT:You can spend two rebuke undead attempts as a standard action to unleash a 60-foot-radius burst of divine energy.

Any poisoned creature in the area that has not yet attempted its saving throw against the poison's secondary effect must do so immediately. (This takes the place of the saving throw at the end of the normal poison duration.)
Profane Agony			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Rebuke undead, Death or Destruction domain.																DESC:You can channel negative energy to deal terrible pain.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.54	BENEFIT:You can spend a rebuke undead attempt as a full-round action to channel your deity's displeasure at a single living creature within 30 feet.

A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your level + your Cha modifier) negates the damage, but not the sickening effect.

###Vile Feats
Unspeakable Vow			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Vile																												DESC:You willingly give yourself to the service of an evil deity or cause, denying yourself an ordinary life to serve your unspeakable ends.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 profane bonus on Intimidate checks.
Vow of Decadence			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Vile		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Unspeakable Vow.																				DESC:You have taken an unspeakable vow to indulge your every desire, even at the expense of others around you.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:You cannot overdose when using drugs. If the drug deals variable damage, you always take the minimum amount. If the drug has a penalty that lasts for a variable amount of time, it is always for the minimum time described. In addition, you gain a +4 competence bonus on saving throws against ingested poisons. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must consume an intoxicating, stimulating, depressing, or hallucinogenic substance at least once per day. If you intentionally abstain, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion, or otherwise unintentionally, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.
Vow of the Spider Queen		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Vile		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 6th, rebuke undead, Unspeakable Vow, Verminfriend.												DESC:You have taken an unspeakable vow to further the interests of the Spider Queen at all costs.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:This unspeakable vow grants a variety of supernatural benefits, but at a terrible price. You gain immunity to poison. When using the Verminfriend feat, you gain a +5 insight bonus on the Charisma check, and you can prevent any single vermin within 30 feet from attacking you. If you succeed, the affected vermin cannot attack you for 24 hours. Also, you can expend a rebuke undead attempt to rebuke or command vermin. This ability functions like rebuke undead, except that it affects vermin. Finally, you develop horrid glands in your mouth that allow you to spit a wad of toxic fluid. Your glands produce enough poison to spit a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Con bonus (if any). Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage and forces the target to succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. Ten rounds later, the target must succeed on a second save against the same DC or take an additional 1d4 points of Strength damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the target takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must not cause harm to any vermin. You may not deal lethal damage or ability damage to such creatures through spells or weapons, though you can deal nonlethal damage. You may not target them with death effects, disintegrate, or other spells that have the immediate potential to cause death or great harm. You also may not use nondamaging spells to incapacitate or weaken vermin so your allies can kill them. In addition, once per week, you must perform a horrid ritual that involves opening yourself to the maddening presence of the Spider Queen. The ritual takes 8 hours, and at the end of this time you take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage. Wisdom damage can be healed normally. If you intentionally break this vow or fail to perform the profane ritual, Lolth finds you wanting. If you have 11 or fewer HD, you immediately transform into a chwidencha (see page 108), becoming a scuttling thing with no memory of your former self. If you have 12 or more HD, you immedi-ately become a drider. In both cases, you automatically lose the benefit of this feat and may not select a new one to replace it. If you break your vow because of magical compulsion, or otherwise unintentionally, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.
Vow of Vengeance			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Vile		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Unspeakable Vow.																				DESC:Filled with hate, you have made an unspeakable vow to visit vengeance on those whom you believe wronged you and your people. Whether the affront is real or imagined, you settle for nothing less than the extermination of your enemy.

You gain a +2 profane bonus on damage rolls against these creatures, as well as a +4 profane bonus on rolls to confirm critical threats against them. Special: To fulfill your vow, you must kill at least one creature of the selected type each month. When facing these creatures, you cannot retreat and you must fight until you or all the creatures of your chosen foe are killed. You can take prisoners, but they must die within 1 week of capture. If you intentionally break any portion of this vow, you immediately and irrevocably lose the benefit of this feat. You may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a result of magical compulsion, or otherwise unintentionally, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atonement spell.

In addition, once per round you can declare that a melee attack you make with a mace, heavy mace, or warmaceCW against a flanked enemy is intended to open the enemy's defenses.

The spell must target or be centered either on you or the target struck (or on any corner of your or your target's space, in the case of an area spell).

DESC:You have learned House Tormtor's fighting technique from its weapon masters.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:If you deal damage on a melee attack with a javelin, you can then throw that javelin at any other target within 30 feet as a swift action (using your highest base ranged attack bonus). You take no penalty when making a melee attack with a javelin. You gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls with javelins.
Vae School				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Style		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Trip, Weapon Focus (spiked chain or whip), base attack bonus +7.						DESC:You have learned House Vae's fighting style.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:Once per round, when you deal damage to a flatfooted foe (or a foe you flank) with a whip or a spiked chain, you can also initiate a trip attack (as if you had hit with a touch attack). If you fail to trip when using this special attack, your opponent cannot attempt to trip you in turn. You must declare this attempt before you roll your attack, and the attempt is wasted for the round if the attack misses. You must have Weapon Focus with the weapon you are using for this feat. In other words, having Weapon Focus (whip) does not allow you to use the Vae School feat with a spiked chain, or vice versa. Normal: You must make a trip attack separately from a normal attack. If you fail to trip the foe, he can attempt to trip you in turn.
Xaniqos School			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Style		PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Shot on the Run, base attack bonus +6.									DESC:You have learned the fighting style of House Xaniqos, which favors aggressive crossbow maneuvers.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:If you have moved at least 10 feet toward your target since the start of your turn, your crossbow attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of damage against that target in this round. This feat's benefit doesn't apply when you are mounted. In addition, reloading your crossbow does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
