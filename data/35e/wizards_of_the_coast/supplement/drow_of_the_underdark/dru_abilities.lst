###Block: Alternate Class Features
# Ability Name					Unique Key					Category of Ability	Type									Description																																																																																																								Ability												Modify VAR
Drow Bard (Deadly Knowledge)			KEY:Bard ~ Deadly Knowledge		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.BardBardicKnowledge					DESC:Drow bards do not travel the world, and thus do not gain the broad range of understanding other bards have. Instead, they study a means of death-dealing normally associated with other classes. Level: 1st. Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard bard's bardic knowledge ability. In addition, you can use your bardic music one fewer time per day than other bards (minimum 1).																																					ABILITY:Bard Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Bard ~ Deadly Knowledge			BONUS:VAR|BardicMusicTimes|-1
Drow Cleric (Master of Spiders)		KEY:Cleric ~ Master of Spiders	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.ClericTurnUndead					DESC:Everything you do, everything you are, is devoted heart and soul to Lolth: to spreading her power across the Underdark, and, of course, to cementing your own base of power among the drow. How better to honor the Weaver of Webs, after all, than to ensure that so potent and loyal a servant as yourself can direct her minions?																																																			ABILITY:Cleric Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Cleric ~ Master of Spiders
Drow Druid (Spider Shape)			KEY:Druid ~ Spider Shape		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.DruidWildShape						DESC:Druids are rare among drow communities. Most drow spellcasters pursue either the faith of Lolth or one of a variety of arcane paths. However, a rare few exist who seek a different, more natural connection between themselves and their subterranean environment. Drow druids forgo the ability to assume animal forms, preferring the shape of their revered totem: the spider.																																											ABILITY:Druid Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Druid ~ Spider Shape
Favored Soul (Sense Prey)			KEY:Favored Soul ~ Sense Prey		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.FavoredSoulResistance				DESC:Viewed with a combination of awe and jealous hatred by other drow, the favored soulsCD of Lolth hold substantial power in their society, but also occupy a truly precarious position. As Lolth's "elite," favored souls are expected, even more than others, to be able to defend themselves and their positions from other drow who seek to take them. Otherwise, they clearly weren't worthy after all, were they? Favored souls often compete with clerics for positions in the priesthood and other high offices.																					ABILITY:Favored Soul Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Favored Soul ~ Sense Prey
Drow Fighter (Hit-and-Run Tactics)		KEY:Fighter ~ Hit-and-Run Tactics	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.RemoveHeavyArmorProf.RemoveTowerShieldProf	DESC:Drow fighters strike fast and melt away before their opponents have a chance to mount a counterattack. Rather than using heavy armor or picking feats that emphasize direct assaults, drow fighters employ techniques that exploit their natural advantages. In exchange for a fighter's access to heavy armor, a drow fighter gains strong first-strike capability.																																													ABILITY:Fighter Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Fighter ~ Hit-and-Run Tactics
Drow Rogue (Poison Use)				KEY:Rogue ~ Poison Use			CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.RogueTrapfinding					DESC:Rogues are common in drow society, fewer in number only than clerics and wizards. They are silent killers, spies, and informants. It falls to them to gather intelligence about rival houses and to eliminate challengers within the hierarchy. For these tasks, drow rogues cultivate the ability to safely utilize poison.																																																				ABILITY:Rogue Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Rogue ~ Poison Use
Drow Swashbuckler (Swift and Deadly)	KEY:Swashbuckler ~ Swift and Deadly	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.SwashbucklerAcrobaticCharge			DESC:The drow swashbucklerCW fills an interesting niche in dark elf society. Their culture of treachery and betrayal offers opportunities for those with wit and skill to rise far. For drow, the swashbuckler class is usually a male pursuit, and well-born sons of the great houses are the most likely to cultivate the abilities this class offers. A rare few drow swashbucklers are renegades: outcasts from drow society, bucking the traditions and loyalties to the matriarchs to seek their own fortunes. Drow swashbucklers give up some of their mobility across difficult terrain to gain a more tactical understanding of movement.	ABILITY:Swashbuckler Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Swashbuckler ~ Swift and Deadly
Warlock (Venomous Blood)			KEY:Warlock ~ Venomous Blood		CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF.WarlockFiendishResistance				DESC:WarlocksCAr among the drow occupy an oddly dichotomous position. They have strong links to the Abyss and to Lolth, but those ties more directly bind them to Lolth's servants-her demons-than to the Spider Queen herself. Thus, although warlocks can occupy positions of power and even become priestesses, drow expect them to be serving the church and the great houses rather than running them.																																							ABILITY:Warlock Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Warlock ~ Venomous Blood
Drow Wizard (Abyssal Specialist)		KEY:Wizard ~ Abyssal Specialist	CATEGORY:ACF		TYPE:ACF								DESC:Wizards are among the most feared and admired nondivine members of drow society. Despite their innate resistance to magic, the drow have great respect for both the spells and the knowledge available to these masters of the arcane arts. Although they are not directly tied to Lolth in the way divine casters and warlocks are, their devotion to the Spider Queen-and indeed, their very upbringing within society-has led to the development of race-specific wizard traits.																										ABILITY:Wizard Class Feature|AUTOMATIC|Wizard ~ Abyssal Specialist

###Block:
# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type								Description
Deadly Knowledge		KEY:Bard ~ Deadly Knowledge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Bard Class Feature		DESC:You are trained in the use of poison. You never risk poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.
Master of Spiders		KEY:Cleric ~ Master of Spiders	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Cleric Class Feature		DESC:You can rebuke or command vermin as an evil cleric rebukes or commands undead. When commanding spiders, you gain a +4 bonus to your effective turning level. This ability otherwise works exactly as rebuke undead. You can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for divine feats.
Spider Shape		KEY:Druid ~ Spider Shape		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Druid Class Feature		DESC:Beginning at 5th level, you can turn yourself into any Small or Medium monstrous spider. You are not mindless, and thus do not gain immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities. You can take the shape of a Large monstrous spider at 8th level, a Tiny monstrous spider at 11th level, and a Huge monstrous spider at 15th level. This class feature otherwise functions as the normal wild shape ability. It doesn't affect your ability to wild shape into plant creatures or elementals (gained at 12th and 16th level, as normal). Special: Because they have a stronger connection to scorpions than to spiders, drow in the EBERRON campaign setting who select this alternative class feature instead gain the ability to wild shape into monstrous scorpions.
Sense Prey			KEY:Favored Soul ~ Sense Prey		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Favored Soul Class Feature	DESC:Three times per day, you can use a standard action to gain tremorsense (MM 316) out to of 5 feet for 1 round per class level. This is a supernatural ability. At 10th level your tremorsense extends to 20 feet, and at 15th level to 30 feet.
Hit-and-Run Tactics	KEY:Fighter ~ Hit-and-Run Tactics	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Fighter Class Feature		DESC:At 1st level, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, when attacking a flat-footed opponent within 30 feet, you can add your Dexterity bonus (if any) as a competence bonus on weapon damage rolls.
Poison Use			KEY:Rogue ~ Poison Use			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Rogue Class Feature		DESC:You are trained in the use of poison. You are never at risk of accidentally poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.
Swift and Deadly		KEY:Swashbuckler ~ Swift and Deadly	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Swashbuckler Class Feature	DESC:When wielding two weapons, if you hit at least once with each weapon in the same round, you can take a 5- foot step as a swift action. This doesn't count against your normal limit of one 5-foot step per round, and you can use this ability even if you've already moved in the round.
Venomous Blood		KEY:Warlock ~ Venomous Blood		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Warlock Class Feature		DESC:At 8th level, you gain a +5 bonus on saves against poison. At 13th level, your blood becomes poisonous. Any creature that damages you with a bite attack, or that swallows you whole, is exposed to this poison (contact; Fort DC 10 + 1/2 your warlock level + Cha modifier; 1d3 Str/1d3 Str). You are immune to your own poisonous blood. At 18th level, you can bring the poison of your blood to the surface of your hand and apply it to a held weapon or to your next eldritch blast. It requires a move action to manifest and apply the poison, and you can do so three times per day. In this more concentrated form, initial and secondary damage are 1d6 Strength each. The poison lasts until you make an attack with the weapon or eldritch blast or until the start of your next turn, whichever comes first. Applying the poison to your eldritch blast doesn't prevent you from applying eldritch essence or blast shape invocations as normal.
Abyssal Specialist	KEY:Wizard ~ Abyssal Specialist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Wizard Class Feature		DESC:You are considered specialized, but not in a specific school. Rather, you gain all the benefits of specialization with a group of spells that includes all those of the following subschools and/or descriptors: chaotic, compulsion, darkness, evil, and fear. You gain all the standard benefits of specialization as applied to this group of spells, as though it were a school unto itself.


###Block: Prestige Classes
# Arachnomancer
Spellcasting	KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:At 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an arachnomancer, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Poison Save Bonus	KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Poison Save Bonus	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:You gain a bonus on saving throws against poison equal to your class level.
Handle Spiders	KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Handle Spiders		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:You gain a +5 bonus on skill checks to use the Handle Animal skill with spiders (see page 46).
Spider Domain	KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Spider Domain		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:You gain access to the SpiderSC domain and the granted power associated with the domain (rebuke spiders as an evil cleric rebukes undead, a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier). If you already have access to one or more domains, you can now choose spells from this domain as your daily domain spells. If you do not already have a domain, each day you can prepare one domain spell for each level you can cast, from 1st on up. See the deity, domains, and domain spells cleric class feature, PH 32.
Spider Shape	KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Spider Shape		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:At 2nd level, you can change into a Small, Medium, or Large monstrous spider (either hunting or web-spinning) and back again three times per day. At 5th level, you can also take the form of a Tiny or Huge monstrous spider, and at 8th level, you can take the form of a Gargantuan monstrous spider. The effect lasts for 1 hour per arachnomancer level. This ability functions as wild shape, so you can select and use the Natural Spell feat. See the wild shape druid class feature, PH 37.
Tremorsense		KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Tremorsense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you can detect and pinpoint any creature or object within 20 feet. At 6th level, your tremorsense extends to 60 feet. You can use this ability five times per day. Activating this ability is a swift action, and it lasts for a number of rounds equal to your arachnomancer class level.
Webwalking		KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Webwalking		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Starting at 4th level, you can ignore webs (magical or nonmagical) as if you were under the effect of a freedom of movement spell. You can climb webs at your normal land speed without needing to make Climb checks and walk along webs without needing to make Balance checks.
Climb Speed		KEY:Arachnomancer ~ Climb Speed		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arachnomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:At 7th level, you gain a climb speed equal to your normal land speed. In addition, you gain a +8 bonus on Climb checks and you can always choose to take 10 on these checks, even if rushed or threatened.

# Cavestalker
Advanced Spelunker		KEY:Cavestalker ~ Advanced Spelunker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:As a cavestalker, your familiarity with the environs of the Underdark allows you to move through it easily, even in the most difficult conditions. As a result, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, and Jump checks in natural subterranean surroundings.
Underdark Affinity		KEY:Cavestalker ~ Underdark Affinity			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:At 2nd level, your adaptation to the Underdark allows you to use your nature-themed class abilities in natural subterranean surroundings as well. These include the druid and ranger abilities of camouflage, hide in plain sight, trackless step, and woodland stride. If you already have wild empathy, you can now use it to affect vermin. If you have the wild shape ability, add vermin to the types of creatures you can become (subject to all the size and frequency limitations provided by that ability). If you do not already have these underlying abilities, Underdark affinity does not grant them to you; it only augments those you already have.
Hide of Stone			KEY:Cavestalker ~ Hide of Stone				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:As you gain levels in the cavestalker class, your body embraces the rigors of the Underdark and takes on something of its hue and toughness. Your skin hardens and becomes flinty, granting you a natural armor bonus in addition to a circumstance bonus on Hide checks when in natural subterranean surroundings. These bonuses increase as you progress through the cavestalker class, at 6th level and again at 10th level.
Lesser Cavesense			KEY:Cavestalker ~ Lesser Cavesense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:At 3rd level, you are gifted with a mystical connection to the Underdark, giving you darkvision out to 120 feet. If you already have darkvision out to 120 feet, your darkvision extends an additional 60 feet. Due to your familiarity with the acoustic qualities of the Underdark, you also gain a +4 competence bonus on Listen checks made in subterranean surroundings.
Exotic Combat Style		KEY:Cavestalker ~ Exotic Combat Style			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:At 4th level, you gain mastery of a specific exotic combat style, either the spiked chain style or the hand crossbow style. If you are not a ranger or have not already selected a ranger combat style, choose one of these two styles. You gain profi- ciency in that exotic weapon-either the spiked chain or the hand crossbow-if you do not already have it. If you already have selected two-weapon combat as a ranger combat style, then the exotic combat style provides you with the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain) feat and permits the use of a spiked chain as a one-handed weapon. If you already have selected archery as a ranger combat style, then the exotic combat style provides you with the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (hand crossbow) feat and grants you the Rapid Reload feat, even if you do not have the normal prerequisites for the feat. If you acquire a ranger combat style after gaining an exotic combat style, then the two styles must correspond in a similar fashion: You must select two-weapon combat after choosing the spiked chain style, or archery after choosing the hand crossbow style. The benefits of your chosen exotic combat style apply only when you wear light or no armor. You lose all benefits of your exotic combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Expert Spelunker			KEY:Cavestalker ~ Expert Spelunker				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:Upon reaching 5th level, your familiarity with the tight confines of the Underdark allows you to retain your Dexterity bonus even when climbing or when in a cramped space. Furthermore, you're better able to negotiate cramped spaces, lowering Escape Artist DCs, move penalties, and attack penalties by one category. See Table 6-1: Cramped Spaces on page 159.
Gaseous Form			KEY:Cavestalker ~ Gaseous Form				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:At 6th level, you gain the ability to traverse the treacherous and confined terrain of the Underdark by assuming gaseous form once per day (caster level 12th).
Improved Exotic Combat Style	KEY:Cavestalker ~ Improved Exotic Combat Style		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:Your aptitude for your chosen exotic combat style increases at 7th level. If you do not already have a combat style from the ranger class, then the improved exotic combat style grants you one of those ranger combat styles. If you already have the hand crossbow exotic combat style, you must select archery; if you already have the spiked chain exotic combat style, you must choose two-weapon combat. If you select archery, then you are treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if you do not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If you select two-weapon combat, then you are treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if you do not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If you already have the ranger two-weapon combat style and the spiked chain exotic combat style, then the improved exotic combat style allows you to treat a spiked chain as one size category smaller for the purpose of use in a cramped space (see Expert Spelunker, above). If you already have the ranger archery combat style and the hand crossbow exotic combat style, then you are treated as having the Manyshot feat even if you do not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. You are able to use this feat in conjunction with a hand crossbow. As before, the benefits of your chosen style apply only when you wear light or no armor. You lose the benefit of your exotic combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
Greater Cavesense			KEY:Cavestalker ~ Greater Cavesense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:When you reach 8th level, your mystical connection to the Underdark increases, granting you tremorsense out to 30 feet.
Void in Space			KEY:Cavestalker ~ Void in Space				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:When you reach 9th level, your attunement to the particular atmosphere of the Underdark allows you to warp the sounds, scents, and vibrations you give off, making you invisible to creatures that rely on senses other than sight to detect others. This effectively makes you undetectable to blindsense, blindsight, and tremorsense. You still make noises and vibrations (though a successful Move Silently check can mask the sounds), but creatures that cannot see are incapable of determining your true location and believe that you are 30 feet in a random direction from where you are actually located. In addition, this ability nullifies the effect of the Blind- Fight feat against you.
Master Spelunker			KEY:Cavestalker ~ Master Spelunker				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cavestalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:By the time you reach 10th level, your affinity for the terrain of the Underdark has become so great that you can negotiate it without difficulty and even merge with it at times. This grants you the ability to use spider climb (as the spell) on any natural stone surface at will. In addition, you can use meld into stone (as the spell) with any surface of unworked stone three times per day.

# Demonbinder
Invocations Known			KEY:Demonbinder ~ Invocations Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Demonbinder Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:At each level above 1st, you gain new invocations as if you had also gained a level in the warlock class. You do not gain any other benefits a warlock would have otherwise gained.
Damnation Points			KEY:Demonbinder ~ Damnation Points				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Demonbinder Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:You gain a number of damnation points equal to your Charisma modifier plus your class level. You use damnation points to activate your demonbind abilities. You cannot spend damnation points when in the area of a consecrate, hallow, or magic circle against evil spell. You regain all spent damnation points after 5 minutes of rest.
Demonbind				KEY:Demonbinder ~ Demonbind					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Demonbinder Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:Once per day per class level, you can spend damnation points to invoke the essence of a demon and bind it to your soul. This changes your general appearance (which has no significant game effect unless stated otherwise) and also grants you certain benefits. Binding a demon in this way is a full-round action and lasts for 10 rounds. If you invoke a second demonbind when another is still active, the new one replaces the old one. Temporary hit points granted by a demonbind vanish when the demonbind ends (or is replaced by a new demonbind). Some demonbinds allow you to spend additional damnation points to gain an extra benefit. You can use this option only when affected by the demonbind, and the benefit lasts until the start of your next turn or until the demonbind ends, whichever comes first. Any saving throw allowed has a DC of 10 + class level + Cha modifier. When under the effect of a demonbind, you gain telepathy out to 100 feet (MM 316) and the evil subtype if you don't have it already. If you are targeted by a banishment or dismissal spell, you instantly lose your demonbind. If you enter an area protected by a hallow or consecrate spell, the demonbind is suppressed for as long as you remain in the area. Each demonbind is the equivalent of a spell whose level equals the damnation point cost for invoking the demonbind.

DESC:&nl;Succubus (3 points): Small, useless black wings erupt from your back. You gain 15 temporary hit points and the benefits of the tongues spell. You can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to gain a +5 competence bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks.	DESC:&nl;Yochlol (4 points): Your flesh takes on a slightly amorphous appearance, occasionally forming tiny vestigial tendrils that wave about as if searching for something. You gain 20 temporary hit points, and you have a 25%% chance to ignore the extra damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. Also, you can spend one damnation point as a swift action to use gaseous form on yourself.	DESC:&nl;Bebilith (4 points): Your skin turns a dark shade of blue and your eyes redden. Six vestigial limbs that flap uselessly for the duration emerge from your ribs. You gain 20 temporary hit points and the scent ability. You can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to gain a climb speed equal to your land speed.	DESC:&nl;Vrock (5 points): A down of gray and white feathers covers your body. Your face twists and contorts, forming a hard beak in place of your mouth. As you move, puffs of harmless dust rise from your body. You gain 25 temporary hit points. In addition, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to augment your eldritch blast with screeching sonic energy. A target struck by this eldritch blast takes an additional 10 points of sonic damage and becomes deafened for 5 rounds (Fort negates deafness).	DESC:&nl;Glabrezu (6 points): Your hands twist into crab-claws. You gain 30 temporary hit points and a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to gain the benefit of a true seeing spell.	DESC:&nl;Nalfeshnee (7 points): Your body swells with corruption, the skin stretching taut from the profound pressure created by the possessing fiend. You gain 35 temporary hit points and resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and fire 5. Additionally, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to lace your eldritch blast with a nalfeshnee's smite. Nonevil targets with fewer HD than your character level who are struck by the eldritch blast are dazed for 1 round, overwhelmed by horrid visions (Will negates).	DESC:&nl;Marilith (8 points): An extra two sets of arms grow from the sides of your body, your legs fuse into a green serpent's tail, and your eyes burn with an unholy light. You gain 40 temporary hit points. Your original arms (if any) are your primary arms, and the new limbs are secondary limbs. You can wield extra weapons with these new limbs, but all such attacks are treated as offhand attacks. Also, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to use one of your new limbs to fire an eldritch blast at a -5 penalty on the attack roll; you can't apply any eldritch essence or blast shape invocations (or any other modifications) to this eldritch blast.	DESC:&nl;Balor (9 points): Massive wings tear out of your back, and angry red flames wreathe your body. You gain 45 temporary hit points and a fly speed equal to your land speed (good maneuverability). Also, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to make a melee touch attack that deals fire damage equal to the damage normally dealt by your eldritch blast.

Lolth's Will		KEY:Dread Fang Of Lolth ~ Lolth's Will			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Fang Of Lolth Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:Your racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities increases to +4.
Lolth's Whispers		KEY:Dread Fang Of Lolth ~ Lolth's Whispers			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Fang Of Lolth Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:The dread voice of the Spider Queen fills your thoughts.

Sudden Strike		KEY:Dread Fang Of Lolth ~ Sudden Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Fang Of Lolth Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:You deal extra damage at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. You can't use sudden strike to deliver nonlethal damage. Weapons capable of dealing only nonlethal damage don't deal extra damage when used as part of a sudden strike. Otherwise, this ability functions as the sneak attack rogue class feature (PH 50), and it stacks with sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target. (This ability is the same as the ninja's sudden strike class feature, described in Complete Adventurer.) This extra damage increases by 1d6 at each odd-numbered level beyond 1st.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Sudden Strike
Poison Use			KEY:Dread Fang Of Lolth ~ Poison Use				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Fang Of Lolth Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you never risk accidentally poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.
Team Maneuverability	KEY:Dread Fang Of Lolth ~ Team Maneuverability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Fang Of Lolth Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:Also at 2nd level, you add one-half your class level as an insight bonus on Climb and Jump checks. All allies within 30 feet gain a +2 competence bonus on these checks if they can see you.
Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Dread Fang Of Lolth ~ Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Fang Of Lolth Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:At 3rd level, you cannot be caught flat-footed and react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. See the uncanny dodge barbarian class feature, PH 26. If you already have this ability, you gain improved uncanny dodge instead (see below).
Improved Evasion		KEY:Dread Fang Of Lolth ~ Improved Evasion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Fang Of Lolth Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, you can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save and take only half damage on a failed save.
