# Rings
# Equipment Name				Type						Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Deadwalker's Ring				TYPE:Magic.Ring				COST:4000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	SPROP:While you wear the ring, any undead you create by a spell (such as animate dead) gain +2 hit points per HD. This benefit doesn't stack with the extra hit points granted by the desecrate spell. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate necromancy. CL 7th.
Ring of Arcane Supremacy		TYPE:Magic.Ring				COST:12000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	SPROP:The ring grants its wearer the ability to reroll a caster level check made to overcome spell resistance with an arcane spell or invocation. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration. CL 3rd.
Ring of Enduring Arcana			TYPE:Magic.Ring				COST:6000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	SPROP:You are considered four levels higher than your actual caster level whenever another character attempts to dispel or counter one of your spells. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate abjuration. CL 9th
Ring of Instant Escape			TYPE:Magic.Ring				COST:18000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	SPROP:When you are subject to a harmful effect that allows a Reflex save to reduce or negate it (such as a fireball or a dragon's breath), you can activate a ring of instant escape to be instantly transported elsewhere, as per dimension door (PH 221), although the range is limited to 40 feet. This occurs just before the effect resolves, so you are unaffected by it (assuming your destination is outside the area of the effect). Aura/Caster Level: Moderate conjuration. CL 7th
Ring of Instant Escape			TYPE:Magic.Ring				COST:32000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.126	SPROP:When you are subject to a harmful effect that allows a Reflex save to reduce or negate it (such as a fireball or a dragon's breath), you can activate a ring of instant escape to be instantly transported elsewhere, as per dimension door (PH 221), although the range is limited to 40 feet. This occurs just before the effect resolves, so you are unaffected by it (assuming your destination is outside the area of the effect).  The rare ring of elusive escape also turns you invisible (as the invisibility spell) and leaves behind a major image (PH 254) of yourself. Both of these effects last for 1 round. The image looks as though it has taken damage from the harmful effect and reacts appropriately to further attacks as well, as though you were concentrating on it for the length of its duraton. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate conjuration and illusion. CL 7th.
Ring of Mighty Summons			TYPE:Magic.Ring				COST:14000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.127	SPROP:When you use this ring while casting a summoning spell, any creature you summon with the spell has maximum hit points per Hit Die. However, the duration of the spell is halved (to a minimum of 1 round). Aura/Caster Level: Moderate conjuration. CL 6th
Spellguard Rings				TYPE:Magic.Ring				COST:4000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.127	SPROP:In order for them to function, both spellguard rings must be worn-the gold ring by a spellcaster, the bronze one by anyone else. When the rings are activated, the wearer of the bronze ring becomes immune to any spell cast by the wearer of the gold ring, as long as that spell is cast within 1 round. The rings can be useful for pulling off certain tactical maneuvers, such as letting the spellcaster lob a fireball into the midst of a horde of orcs, even though his paladin companion stands right in the center of them. The construction costs and price below are for a pair of matched rings. If one ring of a pair is lost or destroyed, the other becomes useless. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate abjuration. CL 7th.
# Rods
Rod of Eldritch Power (Least)		TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:4000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.127	SPROP:Each rod of eldritch power has one invocation- either a blast shape invocation or an eldritch essence invocation-contained within it. You can will it to apply this invocation to any eldritch blast you fire while holding it. This allows you to make use of blast shape or eldritch essence invocations you might not normally have, but it does not change the normal restriction that only one invocation of each type can be applied to any given blast. Faint, no school. CL 1st.
Rod of Eldritch Power (Lesser)	TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:16000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.127	SPROP:Each rod of eldritch power has one invocation- either a blast shape invocation or an eldritch essence invocation-contained within it. You can will it to apply this invocation to any eldritch blast you fire while holding it. This allows you to make use of blast shape or eldritch essence invocations you might not normally have, but it does not change the normal restriction that only one invocation of each type can be applied to any given blast. Moderate, no school. CL 6th.
Rod of Eldritch Power (Greater)	TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:36000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.127	SPROP:Each rod of eldritch power has one invocation- either a blast shape invocation or an eldritch essence invocation-contained within it. You can will it to apply this invocation to any eldritch blast you fire while holding it. This allows you to make use of blast shape or eldritch essence invocations you might not normally have, but it does not change the normal restriction that only one invocation of each type can be applied to any given blast. Moderate, no school. CL 11th.
Rod of Eldritch Power (Dark)		TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:64000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.127	SPROP:Each rod of eldritch power has one invocation- either a blast shape invocation or an eldritch essence invocation-contained within it. You can will it to apply this invocation to any eldritch blast you fire while holding it. This allows you to make use of blast shape or eldritch essence invocations you might not normally have, but it does not change the normal restriction that only one invocation of each type can be applied to any given blast. Strong, no school. CL 16th.
Rod of Elemental Might			TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:9600	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:You gain the benefits of elemental mastery (+2 effective caster level when casting spells of that element, and a +2 competence bonus on saves against spells of that element) applied to whichever element the rod represents. This benefit is in addition to whichever elemental mastery you already possess. If you are already a master of the rod's element, the item grants you no further benefits. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate, no school. CL 17th.
Rod of Magical Precision		TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:12000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:While you are holding a rod of magical precision, any ranged attack you make with a spell or spell-like ability at an opponent engaged in melee does not take the standard - 4 penalty on your attack roll. In addition, you can choose for your spell or spell-like ability to ignore the miss chance granted to a target by concealment or total concealment. In the case of a target that has total concealment, you must still aim at the correct square. Aura/Caster Level: Faint divination. CL 3rd.
Rod of Many Wands				TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:27000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:With this rod, you can trigger multiple wands at once. Although you are not required to fill all three depressions, you cannot selectively activate the wands that you have loaded; activating the rod triggers every wand connected to it. This process drains a number of charges from each wand equal to the number of wands loaded into the rod. For instance, if you have fully loaded the rod, each use drains three charges from each wand. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate, no school. CL 17th.
Rod of Shadowblending			TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:9000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:A rod of shadowblending infuses your normal illusions with shadow, making them partially real. This effect allows you to transform any casting of either minor image or major image into a casting of shadow conjuration, and any casting of major image into shadow evocation. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate illusion. CL 9th.
Rod of Spell Channeling (Lesser)	TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:9000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:You can cast any spell with a range greater than touch or 0 feet with its source as your familiar, rather than from your own person. If the spell affects one or more targets, both you and your familiar must have line of sight to any target selected. For all other purposes (including attack rolls, save DCs, and so on), treat the spell as if you were the caster. You can apply this effect to spells of 3rd level or lower if using a lesser rod of spell channeling, to spells of 6th level or lower if using a normal rod of spell channeling, and to spells of 9th level or lower if using a greater rod of spell channeling. Aura/Caster Level: Strong, no school. CL 17th
Rod of Spell Channeling			TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:32000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:You can cast any spell with a range greater than touch or 0 feet with its source as your familiar, rather than from your own person. If the spell affects one or more targets, both you and your familiar must have line of sight to any target selected. For all other purposes (including attack rolls, save DCs, and so on), treat the spell as if you were the caster. You can apply this effect to spells of 3rd level or lower if using a lesser rod of spell channeling, to spells of 6th level or lower if using a normal rod of spell channeling, and to spells of 9th level or lower if using a greater rod of spell channeling. Aura/Caster Level: Strong, no school. CL 17th
Rod of Spell Channeling (Greater)	TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:73000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:You can cast any spell with a range greater than touch or 0 feet with its source as your familiar, rather than from your own person. If the spell affects one or more targets, both you and your familiar must have line of sight to any target selected. For all other purposes (including attack rolls, save DCs, and so on), treat the spell as if you were the caster. You can apply this effect to spells of 3rd level or lower if using a lesser rod of spell channeling, to spells of 6th level or lower if using a normal rod of spell channeling, and to spells of 9th level or lower if using a greater rod of spell channeling. Aura/Caster Level: Strong, no school. CL 17th
Rod of Spellholding			TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:9000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:You can hold a touch spell in the rod, allowing you to cast other spells or to touch other creatures, without triggering the spell. (Normally, you cannot cast other spells while holding a touch spell, and any creature you touch suffers the effect.) You can use the held spell by using a standard action and making a melee touch attack; the held spell is expended if you succeed on your attack roll, and it has the normal effect. The rod cannot hold a spell indefinitely, however; the spell fades in 6 minutes if you have not already used it. The spell is also lost if the rod of spellholding ever leaves your hands. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate, no school. CL 6th.
Warbringer's Rod				TYPE:Magic.Rod				COST:8312	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:A warbringer's rod functions as a +1 heavy mace. If the wielder has any feats that apply only to a specific weapon (such as Weapon Focus), he can apply the feats' benefit to this weapon as well. In addition, when it is activated, the rod casts both bear's endurance and bull's strength on the wielder simultaneously. These spells remain active as long as the wielder holds the rod (up to the normal duration of each spell). Aura/Caster Level: Faint transmutation. CL 5th
# Staffs
Assassin's Staff				TYPE:Magic.Staff				COST:39000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.130	SPROP:An assassin's staff allows the wielder to produce the following spell effects: . pall of twilight (page 112), 1 charge . vital strike (page 122), 1 charge . deathsight (page 102), 2 charges . unseen strike (page 122), 2 charges Aura/Caster Level: Moderate divination and illusion.

CL 13th.
Staff of Lifeless Touch			TYPE:Magic.Staff				COST:38250	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.130	SPROP:A staff of malediction allows the wielder to produce the following spell effects: . death's call (page 101), 1 charge . suggestion, 1 charge . Vecna's malevolent whisper (page 122), 2 charges . wail of the banshee, 5 charges Aura/Caster Level: Strong enchantment and necromancy. CL 17th.

# Wondrous Items
Amulet of Spell Conversion		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet		COST:18000	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:An amulet of spell conversion allows you to lose one spell you have prepared for the day and replace it with another spell of equal or lower level. The new spell must be one that is already scribed in your spellbook. You can now cast that spell as though you had prepared it normally. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate, no school. CL 11th.
Cloak of Comfort +1			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Cape		COST:3000	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:You are protected by a constant endure elements effect, as are any allies within 30 feet of you. You also gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws. Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration. CL 3rd.
Cloak of Comfort +2			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Cape		COST:6000	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:You are protected by a constant endure elements effect, as are any allies within 30 feet of you. You also gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration. CL 3rd.
Cloak of Comfort +3			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Cape		COST:11000	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:You are protected by a constant endure elements effect, as are any allies within 30 feet of you. You also gain a +3 resistance bonus on saving throws. Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration. CL 3rd.
Cloak of Comfort +4			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Cape		COST:18000	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:You are protected by a constant endure elements effect, as are any allies within 30 feet of you. You also gain a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration. CL 3rd.
Cloak of Comfort +5			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Cape		COST:27000	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:You are protected by a constant endure elements effect, as are any allies within 30 feet of you. You also gain a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws. Aura/Caster Level: Faint abjuration. CL 3rd.
Familiar's Belt				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Belt		COST:6000	WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Your Tiny or smaller familiar instantly appears in the belt's pouch. The familiar can be anywhere on the same plane as you. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate conjuration. CL 11th.
Heward's Fortifying Bedroll		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous			COST:3000	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Heward's fortifying bedroll grants you the benefits of a full 8 hours of rest-including the elimination of fatigue or exhaustion, natural healing, and the ability to prepare or ready arcane spells- over the course of a single hour. Spells cast within the last 8 hours still count against your daily limit as normal. After using Reward's fortifying bedroll, you can't gain the same benefit again (either from the same or a different item) until 48 hours have passed. Aura/Caster Level: Faint transmutation. CL 3rd.
Horizon Goggles				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Goggles.Eyewear	COST:8000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:Horizon goggles grant you the benefits of the Far Shot feat (increases range increment of projectile weapons by 50%%, and of thrown weapons by 100%%). These goggles also increase the range of spells and spelllike abilities that require ranged attack rolls by 50%%. Aura/Caster Level: Faint divination. CL 3rd.
Metamagic Wandgrip			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous			COST:6000	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:You can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a wand placed within the wandgrip. Doing this drains an additional number of charges from the item equal to the normal cost of that feat in spell slots. For instance, Extend Spell normally raises the cost of a spell by one level, so using Extend Spell on a wand or staff would drain one additional charge (on top of the cost of the spell being cast) from the item. In all other ways, this item functions as i? you had the Metamagic Spell Trigger feat (see page 45). Aura/Caster Level: Moderate transmutation. CL 6th.
Murderers Gloves				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Glove		COST:16000	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:The instant the wearer has delivered his sneak attack, skirmish attack, or sudden strike, he turns invisible for 1 round (as the invisibility spell, PH 245). Aura/Caster Level: Moderate illusion. CL 7th.
Quill of Scribing				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous			COST:1750	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:A quill of scribing animates and scribes a scroll for you (of any single spell that you know). Treat this just as if you were scribing it, including gp cost, XP cost, time, and all other construction requirements. Spellcasters typically activate a quill of scribing just before going to bed (or, in the case of more raucous spellcasters, just before going drinking). Aura/Caster Level: Faint, no school. CL 1st.
Steadying Robe				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Robe		COST:1000	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:A steadying robe negates the unsteadying effect of vigorous, violent, or extremely violent motion on your spellcasting (see the Concentration skill, PH 70). You need not make a Concentration check to successfully cast a spell in such a situation. A steadying robe's benefit doesn't apply in any other situations, such as when you take damage or are entangled, grappling, or distracted by weather. The robe also grants you a +2 competence bonus on Balance checks. Aura/Caster Level: Faint transmutation. CL 1st.
Storm strider Boots			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Boot.Footwear	COST:18000	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Before and after making the attack as part of your spring attack, you become pure lightning. You can move through occupied squares during your spring attack, and any creature in a square you move through takes 9d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 17 half). Moving through a creature's space more than once during your spring attack doesn't have any additional effect. You rematerialize briefly at a single point during your spring attack, enabling you to make a single attack as normal. Stormstrider boots also provide a 5-foot enhancement bonus to your land speed. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate transmutation. CL 9th.

# ALCHEMICAL ITEMS
Auran Mask					TYPE:Achemical Item			COST:60	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This mask fits over the character's nose and mouth. The bulk of the item is a cloth packet holding a porous, spongelike substance. It requires a move action to put on or remove, and once a single breath is taken through the mask, its benefits last for only 1 hour (or less if taken underwater). A creature wearing an auran mask receives a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saves against inhaled toxins. In addition, the wearer can breathe underwater as if under the effect of a water breathing spell, though immersing the auran mask in water reduces its remaining duration to 10 minutes (or less, if less than 10 minutes remain).
Crackle Powder				TYPE:Achemical Item			COST:30	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This alchemical powder creates a loud crackling noise, like a broomstick breaking, whenever it is jostled or struck. A single packet covers a 5-foot-radius area; applying the powder requires a full-round action. Once in place, the powder remains active for 1 hour and imposes a -10 penalty on Move Silently checks made when traversing the area.
Fast Torch					TYPE:Achemical Item			COST:5	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This item consists of a tube of waxed paper set into a short wooden handle. The end opposite the handle has a wax seal, and the whole item is about the size of a normal torch. An alchemical substance packed inside the tube ignites when exposed to air. Lighting the torch is as simple as removing the wax seal, which requires a swift action. The lit torch produces a brilliant white light that produces bright illumination in a 30-foot radius and shadowy illumination 30 feet beyond that. A fast torch burns for 10 minutes, even in high winds or underwater (though it can't be ignited underwater). It's possible to extinguish a fast torch by burying it in sand (or a similar substance) or by grinding it out against a nonflammable surface. Either method requires a full-round action; once extinguished, it can't be relit.
Screaming Flask				TYPE:Achemical Item			COST:40	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This container is made from thick leather with a cap sewn on tight and fitted with a ripcord. Pulling the cord rips open the flask and activates the alchemical substance within. The flask emits a high-pitched shriek in a 15-foot cone. Anything in the cone takes ld8 points of sonic damage and is deafened for 1 minute (Fortitude DC 15 negates).
Weeping Flask				TYPE:Achemical Item			COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This item looks like an empty halfgallon waterskin with an airtight seal. When it is opened and exposed to air, an alchemical substance within the flask slowly produces drinkable water. The flask produces water at a rate of 8 ounces per hour (becoming completely full after 8 hours). The water can be poured out as it appears or simply kept in the container.

# OPTIONAL MATERIAL COMPONENTS
Angel Down					TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:100	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:Popular lore has it that this fluffy golden material is reputedly made up of pinfeathers from celestials' wings. In fact, it is pollen gathered from various rare flowers found growing on the Upper Planes. When angel down is used as a component in an abjuration spell, the spell's duration is doubled as if affected by the Extend Spell feat.
Devil's Eye					TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:150	WT:0.1	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:These small, translucent stones seem a little warm to the touch. They also at least faintly resemble an eye with a vivid red sclera, a white or yellow iris, and a black, catlike pupil. Despite the name, devil's eyes are natural crystals found in volcanic areas, often streambeds or collections of glacial debris. The warm feeling comes from a weak acid that forms on the stone's surface. When a devil's eye is used in a divination spell, the spell's level is increased by one (as if by Heighten Spell).
Dragon's Tear				TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:200	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:Reputedly the dried tears of dragons, these irregular little crystals have a milky white color with a faint blue tinge. They are found near mineral springs and volcanic vents (both locales with a decidedly draconic character). When used in any fire or mind-affecting spell, a dragon's tear increases the spell's level by one, as if affected by the Heighten Spell feat.
Fairy Button				TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:200	WT:0.1	SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:These small bits of stone resemble brightly colored mushrooms or flowers. They occur naturally in caverns where the groundwater has the correct mineral content. They get their name from their minuscule size and bright colors-usually red, yellow, green or purple or some variegated combination that includes some or all of those hues. When incorporated into an illusion spell, a fairy button doubles the area of the spell, as if affected by the Widen Spell feat.
Fairy Dust					TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:100	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This fine powder is all but invisible in daylight, but it gleams with a silvery sheen in moonlight. Fey creatures supposedly collect it from newly blossomed wood flowers each spring. In fact, fairy dust is made of the dried and powdered cocoons of certain rare moths that breed in the spring. When used in any transmutation spell, fairy dust doubles the duration of the spell, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat.
Golden Desert Honey			TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:300	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:Actually lumps of dried of dried sap from a rare desert tree, this material is a vital ingredient in expensive incenses and perfumes. When used in a summoning spell with a casting time of 1 round, golden desert honey reduces the casting time to 1 standard action, as if affected by the Rapid Spell feat (see Complete Divine).
Possibility Dust				TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:100	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This iridescent gray material is gathered in the depths of the Astral Plane. Planar scholars believe that possibility dust is literally distilled reality that somehow seeps from the Material Plane to the Astral Plane, where it settles as fine dust. This assertion is unproven; however, spellcasters have found the substance useful when attempt to create something out of nothing. When possibility dust is incorporated into any creation spell, the spell's duration doubles, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat.
Primal Essence				TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:150	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This granular material appears as metallic sand, though it actually comes from the Ethereal Plane. Spellcasters have found that they can shape it as part of spellcasting to take on other forms. Unlike other components described here, spells of higher than 1st level don't automatically require multiple units of primal essence. A pinch of primal essence dust can be substituted for any material component (but not a focus) that costs 100 gp or less. Multiple pinches have an additive effect; three pinches, for example, could substitute for the 250 gp of diamond dust required by stoneskin.
Serpents' Tongue				TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:120	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This material resembles dried snake's tongues, hence the name. In fact, it is a mixture of cured tongues of various rare birds and reptiles and the dried stamens of several kinds of tropical flowers. All the ingredients must be painstakingly gathered by hand and carefully mixed in the correct proportions. When used in an enchantment spell, serpent's tongue doubles the spell's duration, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat.
Singing Shell				TYPE:Optional Material Component	COST:200	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:These little shells resemble miniature conch shells. They come from a rare mollusk found along jungle coastlines. Searching for the shells is time-consuming in the murky water and exposes the gatherer to attack from predators that lurk both in the water and on land. When a singing shell is used in a spell with the sonic descriptor, the spell's area doubles, as if affected by the Widen Spell feat. If the spell doesn't affect an area, its range doubles instead, as if affected by the Enlarge Spell feat.
