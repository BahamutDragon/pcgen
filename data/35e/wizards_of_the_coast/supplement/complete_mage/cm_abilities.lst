Inspire Fear			KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Inspire Fear		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialAttack.Supernatural									DESC:As a standard action, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that makes a living creature within 30 feet ill at ease. The target becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to your nightmare spinner class level; a successful Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) halves this duration. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. Multiple uses of this ability on the same creature don't stack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Nightmare Phantasm		KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Nightmare Phantasm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a figment or glamer spell, you can choose to weave a thread of nightmare phantasm into it as a free action. The spell gains the phantasm descriptor. Each time any enemy attempts a Will save to disbelieve the affected illusion spell, a tiny portion of the spell transforms into a phantasm effect that targets that enemy. The enemy becomes shaken for 1 round (no save). This ability has no other effect on the original spell's duration or effectiveness. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. No creature can be affected by your nightmare phantasm ability more than once in a 24-hour period. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Spirit Chill			KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Spirit Chill		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, creatures affected by a fear effect you cause (whether by a spell, class feature, or other effect) take nonlethal damage as well, depending on the potency of the fear created. Any creature that is shaken takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A creature that becomes frightened takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage, while a creature that becomes panicked takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.75
Deadly Nightmare			KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Deadly Nightmare		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialAttack.Supernatural									DESC:At 5th level, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that can make a living creature literally drop dead. You can target one living creature within 30 feet of you, which must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) or literally die of fright. Even if the save succeeds, the subject is panicked for 1 round. Any creature whose Hit Dice exceed twice your character level is unaffected by this power. This is a mind-affecting fear death effect. You can use this power three times per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.75

# Ultimate Magus
Spellcasting			KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Ultimate Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality											DESC:At each level except 1st, 4th, and 7th, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in both a prepared arcane casting class and a spontaneous arcane casting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of those classes would have gained. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in your arcane spellcasting class with the lowest caster level. For example, a 4th-level wizard/1stlevel sorcerer who gained one level of ultimate magus would gain increased spellcasting ability as if he had gained a level of sorcerer (since that class's caster level is lower than his wizard caster level). If all your arcane spellcasting classes have equal caster levels, you can apply this benefit to any of your existing arcane spellcasting classes. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of those classes would have gained.																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Arcane Spell Power		KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Arcane Spell Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ultimate Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 1st level, your caster level for all arcane spells increases by 1. It increases again at 4th level, 7th level, and 10th level (to a maximum of +4).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Expanded Spell Knowledge	KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Expanded Spell Knowledge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ultimate Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 2nd level, you can select one 0- or 1st-level arcane spell from your spellbook and add it to the list of arcane spells known for a spontaneous casting class, even if you can't yet spontaneously cast spells of that level. (In this case, you would know the spell but wouldn't be able to cast it until you had spell slots of the appropriate level.) You can add another spell from your spellbook to your list of spells known every two levels thereafter. At 4th level, this can be a 0-, 1st-, or 2nd-level spell. At 6th level, this can be any spell of 3rd level or lower. At 8th level, this spell can be of 4th level or lower, and at 10th level it can be of 5th level or lower.																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Augmented Casting			KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Augmented Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ultimate Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you can choose to sacrifice a spell or spell slot from one of your classes to apply the effect of a metamagic feat that you know to a spell cast using another arcane class. (For instance, you could sacrifice a sorcerer slot to apply a metamagic effect to a wizard spell.) This sacrificed spell or slot is lost (just as if you had cast the spell) in addition to the spell you are actually casting. The level of the spell to be augmented can't exceed 1/2 your class level. For example, when you first gain this ability, you can only apply a metamagic effect to 1st-level spells. A 10th-level ultimate magus can affect spells of 5th level or lower. The level of the spell slot sacrificed must equal or exceed the spell level adjustment of the metamagic feat. To empower a spell, for example, you would have to spend a 2nd-level or higher spell. You can't use this ability to augment a spell already affected by a metamagic feat. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 your class level.

# Unseen Seer
Spellcasting			KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an unseen seer, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.81
Damage Bonus			KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Damage Bonus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DEFINE:UnseenSeerDamageBonusDice|0		DESC:At 1st level, the extra damage you deal with your sneak attack, skirmish, or sudden strike ability increases by ld6. If you have more than one of these abilities, only one ability gains this increase (choose each time you gain this benefit). Your sneak attack, skirmish, or sudden strike damage increases by another ld6 at 4th level, 7th level, and 10th level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	ASPECT:NAME|Damage Bonus +%1d6|UnseenSeerDamageBonusDice
Advanced Learning			KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Advanced Learning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, you can add a new spell to your spellbook or list of spells known, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a divination spell of a level no higher than that of the highest-level arcane spell you already know. The spell can be from any class's spell list (arcane or divine). Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to your spell list and can be cast just like any other spell on your list.																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.81
Silent Spell			KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Silent Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:At 2nd level, you gain Silent Spell as a bonus feat.

Divination Spell Power		KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Divination Spell Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DEFINE:DivinationSpellPowerBonus|0		DESC:At 3rd level, you gain a +1 bonus to your caster level when casting an arcane divination spell. This bonus improves to +2 at 6th level, and to +3 at 9th level. This benefit comes at a cost: Your caster level for all other arcane spells is reduced by 1 at 3rd level. This reduction becomes 2 at 6th level and becomes 3 at 9th level. For example, a 4th-level rogue/1st-level sorcerer/6th-level unseen seer would have a caster level of 9th for her arcane divination spells, but only 5th for her nondivination arcane spells.																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.81	ASPECT:NAME|Divination Spell Power +%1|DivinationSpellPowerBonus
Guarded Mind			KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Guarded Mind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Any successful unseen seer must learn to protect herself from magic that would reveal her identity. At 5th level, you become protected by nondetection (as the spell, but with a permanent duration). For the purpose of divinations attempted against you, your caster level equals your character level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.81

# Wild Soul
Spellcasting			KEY:Wild Soul ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:At every wild soul level beyond 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class you belonged to before you added the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other class benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a wild soul, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Seelie Courtier			KEY:Wild Soul ~ Seelie Courtier			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:At 1st level, you must choose either the seelie or the unseelie path. Good-aligned characters can't choose the unseelie path, while evil-aligned characters are barred from the seelie path. This choice determines certain benefits you gain from this prestige class. If your alignment later changes to make your choice illegal, you automatically exchange all seelie- or unseelie-related class features for their opposites. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to your wild soul level on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks made in to influence fey and magical beasts.																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Spontaneous Spells		KEY:Wild Soul ~ Spontaneous Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:A wild soul can tap into the magic that naturally infuses fey and magical beasts to cast spells that were not prepared ahead of time. You can sacrifice any prepared arcane spell (or, for a spontaneous caster, an arcane spell slot) to cast a particular spell of the same spell level or lower. Depending on whether you have chosen the seelie or unseelie path, you choose from different specific spells as specified on the table below. You gain access to these spontaneous spell options by level as shown on Table 3-11: The Wild Soul. Access to a spontaneous spell does not grant the ability to cast it if you do not have a prepared spell or spell slot of appropriately high level to lose in exchange. For example, a 5th-level wizard/4th-level wild soul who chose the seelie path could lose a prepared ice storm to cast break enchantment or a lower-level option (invisibility sphere, Tasha's hideous laughter, or remove fear). A 6th-level sorcerer/1st-level wild soul who chose the unseelie path can spontaneously cast lesser confusion, detect thoughts, or poison. These spells are not considered to be part of your class spell list, so this feature doesn't grant you the ability to activate spell trigger or spell completion items using these spells. Spell Level = Seelie/Unseelie 1st = remove fear/lesser confusion 2nd = Tasha's hideous laughter/detect thoughts 3rd = invisibility sphere/poison 4th = break enchantment/bestow curse 5th = baleful polymorph/endless slumber 6th = true seeing/mass suggestion 7th = prismatic spray/waves of exhaustion 8th = sympathy/horrid wilting 9th = time stop/wail of the banshee																SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Seelie Bond				KEY:Wild Soul ~ Seelie Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:When you cast summon seelie ally or a summon monster spell to bring forth a creature from the summon seelie ally list, your connection to the seelie increases, granting you benefits. These benefits remain as long as one of the seelie or unseelie creatures you summoned is alive and the duration of the spell has not expired. The benefits described below are cumulative. Thus, a l0th-level wild soul would gain all of them upon summoning a seelie or unseelie ally. At 2nd level, you gain immunity to magic and nonmagical sleep effects. This ability grants elves immunity to nonmagical sleep effects, to which they are normally vulnerable. At 4th level, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against enchantment spells or effects. The bonus against enchantment effects is untyped and thus stacks with an elf's or half-elf's +2 racial bonus against enchantment spells and effects. At 6th level, your base land speed increases by 10 feet. At 8th level, add 1 to the Difficulty Class of saving throws against illusion spells you cast. At 10th level, add 1 to the Difficulty Class of saving throws against enchantment spells you cast.																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Summon Seelie Ally		KEY:Wild Soul ~ Summon Seelie Ally			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a wild soul can summon a seelie ally three times per day. This ability functions like summon monster I except that you choose a creature from a list of options, as detailed on the table below, based on your wild soul level and path. You can use this ability to summon one creature from the highest-level list available to you, ld3 creatures of the same kind from the next highest-level list, or ld4 +1 creatures of the same kind from any lower-level list. Your caster level is equal to your character level. In addition, whenever you cast a summon monster spell of 4th to 8th level, you can choose a creature from the appropriate list below in place of one of the normal options.
