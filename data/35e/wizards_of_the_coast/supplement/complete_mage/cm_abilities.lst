Inspire Fear			KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Inspire Fear		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialAttack.Supernatural									DESC:As a standard action, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that makes a living creature within 30 feet ill at ease. The target becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to your nightmare spinner class level; a successful Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) halves this duration. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. Multiple uses of this ability on the same creature don't stack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Nightmare Phantasm		KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Nightmare Phantasm	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, when you cast a figment or glamer spell, you can choose to weave a thread of nightmare phantasm into it as a free action. The spell gains the phantasm descriptor. Each time any enemy attempts a Will save to disbelieve the affected illusion spell, a tiny portion of the spell transforms into a phantasm effect that targets that enemy. The enemy becomes shaken for 1 round (no save). This ability has no other effect on the original spell's duration or effectiveness. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. No creature can be affected by your nightmare phantasm ability more than once in a 24-hour period. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Spirit Chill			KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Spirit Chill		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural								DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, creatures affected by a fear effect you cause (whether by a spell, class feature, or other effect) take nonlethal damage as well, depending on the potency of the fear created. Any creature that is shaken takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A creature that becomes frightened takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage, while a creature that becomes panicked takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage.

Deadly Nightmare			KEY:Nightmare Spinner ~ Deadly Nightmare		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Nightmare Spinner Class Feature.SpecialAttack.Supernatural									DESC:At 5th level, you can create a mind-affecting fear effect that can make a living creature literally drop dead. You can target one living creature within 30 feet of you, which must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) or literally die of fright. Even if the save succeeds, the subject is panicked for 1 round. Any creature whose Hit Dice exceed twice your character level is unaffected by this power. This is a mind-affecting fear death effect. You can use this power three times per day.

# Ultimate Magus

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of those classes would have gained. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in your arcane spellcasting class with the lowest caster level. For example, a 4th-level wizard/1stlevel sorcerer who gained one level of ultimate magus would gain increased spellcasting ability as if he had gained a level of sorcerer (since that class's caster level is lower than his wizard caster level). If all your arcane spellcasting classes have equal caster levels, you can apply this benefit to any of your existing arcane spellcasting classes. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of those classes would have gained.																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Arcane Spell Power		KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Arcane Spell Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ultimate Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 1st level, your caster level for all arcane spells increases by 1.

Expanded Spell Knowledge	KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Expanded Spell Knowledge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ultimate Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 2nd level, you can select one 0- or 1st-level arcane spell from your spellbook and add it to the list of arcane spells known for a spontaneous casting class, even if you can't yet spontaneously cast spells of that level. (In this case, you would know the spell but wouldn't be able to cast it until you had spell slots of the appropriate level.) You can add another spell from your spellbook to your list of spells known every two levels thereafter. At 4th level, this can be a 0-, 1st-, or 2nd-level spell. At 6th level, this can be any spell of 3rd level or lower. At 8th level, this spell can be of 4th level or lower, and at 10th level it can be of 5th level or lower.																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.78
Augmented Casting			KEY:Ultimate Magus ~ Augmented Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ultimate Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you can choose to sacrifice a spell or spell slot from one of your classes to apply the effect of a metamagic feat that you know to a spell cast using another arcane class. (For instance, you could sacrifice a sorcerer slot to apply a metamagic effect to a wizard spell.) This sacrificed spell or slot is lost (just as if you had cast the spell) in addition to the spell you are actually casting. The level of the spell to be augmented can't exceed 1/2 your class level. For example, when you first gain this ability, you can only apply a metamagic effect to 1st-level spells. A 10th-level ultimate magus can affect spells of 5th level or lower. The level of the spell slot sacrificed must equal or exceed the spell level adjustment of the metamagic feat. To empower a spell, for example, you would have to spend a 2nd-level or higher spell. You can't use this ability to augment a spell already affected by a metamagic feat. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 your class level.

# Unseen Seer

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an unseen seer, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

If you have more than one of these abilities, only one ability gains this increase (choose each time you gain this benefit). Your sneak attack, skirmish, or sudden strike damage increases by another ld6 at 4th level, 7th level, and 10th level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	ASPECT:NAME|Damage Bonus +%1d6|UnseenSeerDamageBonusDice
Advanced Learning			KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Advanced Learning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, you can add a new spell to your spellbook or list of spells known, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a divination spell of a level no higher than that of the highest-level arcane spell you already know. The spell can be from any class's spell list (arcane or divine). Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to your spell list and can be cast just like any other spell on your list.

This bonus improves to +2 at 6th level, and to +3 at 9th level. This benefit comes at a cost: Your caster level for all other arcane spells is reduced by 1 at 3rd level. This reduction becomes 2 at 6th level and becomes 3 at 9th level. For example, a 4th-level rogue/1st-level sorcerer/6th-level unseen seer would have a caster level of 9th for her arcane divination spells, but only 5th for her nondivination arcane spells.

Guarded Mind			KEY:Unseen Seer ~ Guarded Mind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Unseen Seer Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Any successful unseen seer must learn to protect herself from magic that would reveal her identity.

SOURCEPAGE:p.81

# Wild Soul
Spellcasting			KEY:Wild Soul ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:At every wild soul level beyond 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class you belonged to before you added the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other class benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a wild soul, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Seelie Courtier			KEY:Wild Soul ~ Seelie Courtier			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:At 1st level, you must choose either the seelie or the unseelie path. Good-aligned characters can't choose the unseelie path, while evil-aligned characters are barred from the seelie path. This choice determines certain benefits you gain from this prestige class. If your alignment later changes to make your choice illegal, you automatically exchange all seelie- or unseelie-related class features for their opposites. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to your wild soul level on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks made in to influence fey and magical beasts.																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Spontaneous Spells		KEY:Wild Soul ~ Spontaneous Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:A wild soul can tap into the magic that naturally infuses fey and magical beasts to cast spells that were not prepared ahead of time. You can sacrifice any prepared arcane spell (or, for a spontaneous caster, an arcane spell slot) to cast a particular spell of the same spell level or lower. Depending on whether you have chosen the seelie or unseelie path, you choose from different specific spells as specified on the table below. You gain access to these spontaneous spell options by level as shown on Table 3-11: The Wild Soul. Access to a spontaneous spell does not grant the ability to cast it if you do not have a prepared spell or spell slot of appropriately high level to lose in exchange. For example, a 5th-level wizard/4th-level wild soul who chose the seelie path could lose a prepared ice storm to cast break enchantment or a lower-level option (invisibility sphere, Tasha's hideous laughter, or remove fear). A 6th-level sorcerer/1st-level wild soul who chose the unseelie path can spontaneously cast lesser confusion, detect thoughts, or poison. These spells are not considered to be part of your class spell list, so this feature doesn't grant you the ability to activate spell trigger or spell completion items using these spells. Spell Level = Seelie/Unseelie 1st = remove fear/lesser confusion 2nd = Tasha's hideous laughter/detect thoughts 3rd = invisibility sphere/poison 4th = break enchantment/bestow curse 5th = baleful polymorph/endless slumber 6th = true seeing/mass suggestion 7th = prismatic spray/waves of exhaustion 8th = sympathy/horrid wilting 9th = time stop/wail of the banshee																SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Seelie Bond				KEY:Wild Soul ~ Seelie Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:When you cast summon seelie ally or a summon monster spell to bring forth a creature from the summon seelie ally list, your connection to the seelie increases, granting you benefits. These benefits remain as long as one of the seelie or unseelie creatures you summoned is alive and the duration of the spell has not expired. The benefits described below are cumulative. Thus, a l0th-level wild soul would gain all of them upon summoning a seelie or unseelie ally. At 2nd level, you gain immunity to magic and nonmagical sleep effects. This ability grants elves immunity to nonmagical sleep effects, to which they are normally vulnerable. At 4th level, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against enchantment spells or effects. The bonus against enchantment effects is untyped and thus stacks with an elf's or half-elf's +2 racial bonus against enchantment spells and effects. At 6th level, your base land speed increases by 10 feet. At 8th level, add 1 to the Difficulty Class of saving throws against illusion spells you cast. At 10th level, add 1 to the Difficulty Class of saving throws against enchantment spells you cast.																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Summon Seelie Ally		KEY:Wild Soul ~ Summon Seelie Ally			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Wild Soul Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a wild soul can summon a seelie ally three times per day. This ability functions like summon monster I except that you choose a creature from a list of options, as detailed on the table below, based on your wild soul level and path. You can use this ability to summon one creature from the highest-level list available to you, ld3 creatures of the same kind from the next highest-level list, or ld4 +1 creatures of the same kind from any lower-level list. Your caster level is equal to your character level. In addition, whenever you cast a summon monster spell of 4th to 8th level, you can choose a creature from the appropriate list below in place of one of the normal options.

Arcane Hunter		KEY:Ranger ACF ~ Arcane Hunter		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.RangerACF.RangerFavoredEnemy1	DESC:Rangers learn to track and hunt creatures of a certain type when choosing a favored enemy. Some rangers concern themselves less with what a creature is, and more with what it does. These rangers learn to identify signs of the arcane and make it their business to combat those who use arcane magic in opposition to their goals.	PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=1	PRETEXT:Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.	DESC: Replaces: At 1st level, you do not select a favored enemy from Table 3-14 in the Player's Handbook. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, you can choose favored enemies as normal. Benefit: At 1st level, you gain favored enemy (arcanists). This feature works just like the favored enemy ability (PH 47). The bonuses granted apply to any character capable of casting arcane spells or using invocations (but not other spell-like abilities).

Some take this a step farther, learning magical tricks that boost their mobility or defense.	PRECLASS:1,Swashbuckler=1	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=1	DESC: Replaces: You lose the grace class feature and all later improvements to that ability.	DESC: Benefit: Choose one of the following spells: blur, expeditious retreat, feather fall, jump, or spider climb. You can use that spell-like ability as a swift action (or, in the case of feather fall, as an immediate action); the duration of the spell is reduced to 1 round. Your caster level is equal to your swashbuckler level. At 11th level, you can choose a second spell-like ability from the list above, and the benefit gained from both of these spell-like abilities lasts for 2 rounds. At 20th level, you can choose a third spell-like ability, and the benefit of each one lasts for 3 rounds. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Int modifier (minimum 1/day). Regardless of the number of arcane stunts you possess, the same total daily limit applies to their use that is, each day, an 11th-level swashbuckler with an Intelligence of 14 could use one of his spell-like abilities three times or one ability twice and the other once.

Armored Mage		KEY:Fighter ACF ~ Armored Mage		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.FighterACF.FighterArmorProficiencies	DESC: Rare is the fighter who hasn't envied the wizard's bag of magical tricks. Although even the most basic arcane spell remains beyond a fighter's abilities, those who aspire to such talents can, with practice, learn to cast simple arcane spells while wearing light armor. On its own, this alternative feature grants little benefit to a single-classed fighter; only in conjunction with one or more levels of sorcerer, wizard, or a similar arcane spellcasting class does this ability come into play.	PRECLASS:1,Fighter=1	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=1	DESC: Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank. Replaces: You lose proficiency with medium armor and heavy armor. Benefit: Choose one arcane spellcasting class, such as sorcerer. You can avoid any chance of arcane spell failure for spells gained from this class as long as you restrict yourself to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to any other form of armor or shields, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes. This benefit applies only to spells of a level equal to or lower than your fighter class level + 1.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|ACF ~ Armored Mage
Curse Breaker		KEY:Paladin ACF ~ Curse Breaker		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.PaladinACF.PaladinRemoveDisease		DESC:Most paladins use their divinely granted powers to combat diseases that plague their allies. Paladins with an interest in the arcane particularly those who battle necromancers sometimes prefer to learn to counteract the effects of magical curses.	PRECLASS:1,Paladin=6	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=1		DESC: Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.	DESC: Replaces: You do not gain the remove disease spell-like ability or any later improvement of that ability.	DESC: Benefit: At 6th level, you can produce a remove curse effect, as the spell, once per week. You can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels beyond 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth). Beginning at 12th level, you can spend two of your weekly uses to produce a break enchantment effect, as the spell. These are spell-like abilities.

Divine Counterspell	KEY:Paladin ACF ~ Divine Counterspell	CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.PaladinACF.PaladinTurnUndead		DESC:Although the ability to turn undead is arguably a defining cleric characteristic, some clerics (and paladins) find that they can be even more effective crusaders by opposing evil spellcasters. The ability to negate an enemy spellcasters magic grants a character an unexpected edge.	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=1	PRECLASS:1,Paladin=4	DESC: Replaces: You do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.	DESC: Benefit: You gain the supernatural ability to counter another spellcaster's magic through pure force of will. This ability functions just as if you were using dispel magic to counter the spell, except that you add your cleric level (instead of your caster level) to the d20 roll. You don't need to identify the spell the opposing spellcaster is casting to make the attempt. If you don't have a cleric level, use your effective cleric level for the purpose of turning undead. For example, a paladin would normally turn undead as a cleric of three levels lower; her effective cleric level for counterspelling is equal to her paladin level 3. You can attempt to counterspell a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Cha modifier. A character with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana) gets a +2 bonus on counterspelling attempts when using this ability.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|ACF ~ Divine Counterspell

Divine Magician		KEY:Cleric ACF ~ Divine Counterspell	CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.ClericACF	BONUS:DOMAIN|NUMBER|-1	DESC:Deities influence the world through the divine spells they grant their worshipers. Some clerics, however, choose to explore magical powers beyond those commonly provided by the gods. By giving up some of their divine power, these clerics gain access to spells normally beyond their abilities. This class feature can be chosen only once.	PRECLASS:1,Cleric=1	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=1		DESC: Replaces: You gain only one domain (including spells and granted power) at 1st level, rather than two.	DESC: Benefit: You can add one 1st-level abjuration, divination, or necromancy wizard spell to your cleric spell list. Each time you gain the ability to cast a new level of cleric spells, you can add a single wizard spell of the same level from one of those schools to your cleric spell list.

Elemental Companion	KEY:Druid ACF ~ Divine Counterspell		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.DruidACF.DruidWildEmpathy.DruidAnimalCompanion	DESC:Every druid reveres nature, but some pay more respect to the fundamental building blocks of the natural world than to its flora and fauna. By forgoing her bond with the animal kingdom, a druid can instead take on an elemental creature as her companion.	PRECLASS:1,Druid=1	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (the planes)=1		PRETEXT:Special Requirement: Knowledge (the planes) 1 rank, Speak Language (Auran, Terran, Ignan, or Aquan)	DESC: Replaces: You do not gain an animal companion, nor do you gain wild empathy.	DESC: Benefit: You gain the companionship of a Small elemental (air, earth, fire, or water; your choice). You must speak the language of your chosen elemental companion (Auran, Terran, Ignan, or Aquan, respectively). Your elemental companion has the normal statistics of an elemental of its kind. It does not gain any extra HD, natural armor adjustment, Strength or Dexterity adjustment, or extra tricks (it is intelligent enough to follow your spoken commands and thus needs no tricks). It gains all other special abilities normally granted to an animal companion, with the exception of Multiattack. At 4th level, your elemental grows into a Medium elemental of the same kind. Its statistics change appropriately. At 10th level, you can choose for your elemental companion to grow to a Large elemental of the same kind, with the appropriate changes to its statistics. If you choose for your elemental to remain Medium, it instead gains 2 HD, +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, and damage reduction 5/ . At 16th level, you can choose for your elemental companion to grow to a Huge elemental of the same kind, with the appropriate changes to its statistics. If you choose for your elemental to remain at its current size, it instead gains an additional +4 HD, +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and damage reduction 5/ . All these benefits stack with existing statistics except for the damage reduction.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|ACF ~ Elemental Companion
Focused Specialist	KEY:Wizard ACF ~ Focused Specialist		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.WizardACF	DESC:Every wizard who calls himself a specialist takes pride in wielding his preferred form of magic. Those who are exceptionally pure of purpose take this specialization to an entirely new level, disdaining breadth of skill in favor of even greater focus.	PRECLASS:1,Wizard=1	BONUS:VAR|ProhibitedWizardSchool|1	BONUS:VAR|WizardSpecialtyKnownSpells|2	DESC: Special Requirement: You must be a specialist wizard. Replaces: You lose one spell slot from each level of wizard spells you can cast. If you later gain the ability to cast higher level wizard spells, you lose one spell slot from each new level of spells you can cast. You must also choose another prohibited school of magic, which can't be divination. Benefit: You can prepare two additional spells of your specialty school per spell level each day. These extra spells are in addition to those normally granted to a specialist wizard. This benefit doesn't apply to spells gained from classes other than wizard.
Soulwarp Strike		KEY:Monk ACF ~ Soulwarp Strike		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	COST:0	TYPE:ACF.MonkACF.MonkBonusFeat1	DESC:The traditional monk seeks balance in body, mind, and soul, and through this equilibrium gains various combat talents. A monk who learns the secret of the soulwarp strike masters an arcane talent of necromancy that infects her enemy's ki, producing an effect akin to terrible sickness.	PRECLASS:1,Monk=1	DESC: Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank. Replaces: You do not gain the monk bonus feat normally acquired at 1st level. Benefit: You know how to channel necromantic energy into your unarmed strikes. You must declare that you are using this ability before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). In addition to dealing its normal damage, your unarmed strike renders any living creature nauseated for 1 round, or sickened for 1 round if it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your monk level, and no more than once per round. Creatures immune to necromancy effects (such as constructs) are unaffected by this ability.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|ACF ~ Soulwarp Strike

PRECLASS:1,Monk=2	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (arcana)=1		PRETEXT:Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.	DESC: Replaces: You do not gain evasion. (If you would later gain improved evasion as a special ability, you gain evasion instead.)	DESC: Benefit: You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability. For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a scorching ray, you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the scorching ray deals its normal damage to the wizard. This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren't subject to this reflection. If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as scorching ray cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard's scorching ray spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|ACF ~ Spell Reflection

For example, at 5th level, you reduce your 2nd-level spells known from two to one but you gain the previously unavailable 1st-level spell (increasing your 1st-level spells known from three to four). Benefit: You gain extra hit points equal to two times your sorcerer class level. Every time you advance a level, you gain another 2 extra hit points. (So, at 1st level you have 2 extra hit points, at 2nd level you have 4 extra hit points, and so on.) You also gain the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat for a melee weapon of your choice, as well as Weapon Focus with that weapon.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|ACF ~ Stalwart Sorcerer

# Display Abilities
Arcane Hunter		KEY:ACF ~ Arcane Hunter			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	DESC:Rangers learn to track and hunt creatures of a certain type when choosing a favored enemy. Some rangers concern themselves less with what a creature is, and more with what it does. These rangers learn to identify signs of the arcane and make it their business to combat those who use arcane magic in opposition to their goals.	DESC: Replaces: At 1st level, you do not select a favored enemy from Table 3-14 in the Player's Handbook. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, you can choose favored enemies as normal. Benefit: At 1st level, you gain favored enemy (arcanists). This feature works just like the favored enemy ability (PH 47). The bonuses granted apply to any character capable of casting arcane spells or using invocations (but not other spell-like abilities).	ABILITY:Favored Enemy|AUTOMATIC|Favored Enemy ~ Arcanist
Arcane Stunt		KEY:ACF ~ Arcane Stunt			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	DESC:Choose one of the following spells: blur, expeditious retreat, feather fall, jump, or spider climb. You can use that spell-like ability as a swift action (or, in the case of feather fall, as an immediate action); the duration of the spell is reduced to 1 round. Your caster level is equal to your swashbuckler level. At 11th level, you can choose a second spell-like ability from the list above, and the benefit gained from both of these spell-like abilities lasts for 2 rounds. At 20th level, you can choose a third spell-like ability, and the benefit of each one lasts for 3 rounds. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Int modifier (minimum 1/day). Regardless of the number of arcane stunts you possess, the same total daily limit applies to their use that is, each day, an 11th-level swashbuckler with an Intelligence of 14 could use one of his spell-like abilities three times or one ability twice and the other once.	DEFINE:POOL_ArcaneStunt|0	BONUS:VAR|POOL_ArcaneStunt|1+(SwashbucklerLVL>=11)+(SwashbucklerLVL>=20)
Armored Mage		KEY:ACF ~ Armored Mage			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.32	DESC:Choose one arcane spellcasting class, such as sorcerer. You can avoid any chance of arcane spell failure for spells gained from this class as long as you restrict yourself to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to any other form of armor or shields, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes. This benefit applies only to spells of a level equal to or lower than your fighter class level + 1.
Curse Breaker		KEY:ACF ~ Curse Breaker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	DESC:At 6th level, you can produce a remove curse effect, as the spell, once per week. You can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels beyond 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth). Beginning at 12th level, you can spend two of your weekly uses to produce a break enchantment effect, as the spell. These are spell-like abilities.
Divine Counterspell	KEY:ACF ~ Divine Counterspell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	DESC:You gain the supernatural ability to counter another spellcaster's magic through pure force of will. This ability functions just as if you were using dispel magic to counter the spell, except that you add your cleric level (instead of your caster level) to the d20 roll. You don't need to identify the spell the opposing spellcaster is casting to make the attempt. If you don't have a cleric level, use your effective cleric level for the purpose of turning undead. For example, a paladin would normally turn undead as a cleric of three levels lower; her effective cleric level for counterspelling is equal to her paladin level 3. You can attempt to counterspell a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Cha modifier. A character with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana) gets a +2 bonus on counterspelling attempts when using this ability.
Divine Magician		KEY:ACF ~ Divine Magician		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	DESC:You can add one 1st-level abjuration, divination, or necromancy wizard spell to your cleric spell list. Each time you gain the ability to cast a new level of cleric spells, you can add a single wizard spell of the same level from one of those schools to your cleric spell list.
Elemental Companion	KEY:ACF ~ Elemental Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	DESC:You gain the companionship of a Small elemental (air, earth, fire, or water; your choice). You must speak the language of your chosen elemental companion (Auran, Terran, Ignan, or Aquan, respectively). Your elemental companion has the normal statistics of an elemental of its kind. It does not gain any extra HD, natural armor adjustment, Strength or Dexterity adjustment, or extra tricks (it is intelligent enough to follow your spoken commands and thus needs no tricks). It gains all other special abilities normally granted to an animal companion, with the exception of Multiattack. At 4th level, your elemental grows into a Medium elemental of the same kind. Its statistics change appropriately. At 10th level, you can choose for your elemental companion to grow to a Large elemental of the same kind, with the appropriate changes to its statistics. If you choose for your elemental to remain Medium, it instead gains 2 HD, +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, and damage reduction 5/-. At 16th level, you can choose for your elemental companion to grow to a Huge elemental of the same kind, with the appropriate changes to its statistics. If you choose for your elemental to remain at its current size, it instead gains an additional +4 HD, +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and damage reduction 5/-. All these benefits stack with existing statistics except for the damage reduction.

Focused Specialist	KEY:ACF ~ Focused Specialist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	DESC:You can prepare two additional spells of your specialty school per spell level each day. These extra spells are in addition to those normally granted to a specialist wizard. This benefit doesn't apply to spells gained from classes other than wizard.
Soulwarp Strike		KEY:ACF ~ Soulwarp Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.34	DESC:You know how to channel necromantic energy into your unarmed strikes. You must declare that you are using this ability before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). In addition to dealing its normal damage, your unarmed strike renders any living creature nauseated for 1 round, or sickened for 1 round if it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your monk level, and no more than once per round. Creatures immune to necromancy effects (such as constructs) are unaffected by this ability.
Spell Reflection		KEY:ACF ~ Spell Reflection		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.35	DESC:You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability. For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a scorching ray, you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the scorching ray deals its normal damage to the wizard. This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren't subject to this reflection. If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as scorching ray cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard's scorching ray spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).
Spell Sense			KEY:ACF ~ Spell Sense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.35	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against spells and spelllike abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every three barbarian or rogue levels thereafter (to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and so on to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This is an extraordinary ability.
Spellbreaker Song		KEY:ACF ~ Spellbreaker Song		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.35	DESC:You can use your music or poetics to interfere with spells that have verbal components. Doing this costs one daily use of your bardic music ability and requires a standard action to start. Enemy spellcasters within 30 feet of you take a 20%% spell failure chance when casting any spell that has a verbal component (as if they were deafened). You can maintain your spellbreaker song for 3 rounds. This ability follows all the other appropriate rules for bardic music.
Stalwart Sorcerer		KEY:ACF ~ Stalwart Sorcerer		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.36	DESC:As a 1st-level character, you have one 1st-level spell known rather than two. When you would gain a second known spell from a higher level, apply this penalty to the new spell level but remove it from the lower level. For example, at 5th level, you reduce your 2nd-level spells known from two to one but you gain the previously unavailable 1st-level spell (increasing your 1st-level spells known from three to four). Benefit: You gain extra hit points equal to two times your sorcerer class level. Every time you advance a level, you gain another 2 extra hit points. (So, at 1st level you have 2 extra hit points, at 2nd level you have 4 extra hit points, and so on.) You also gain the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat for a melee weapon of your choice, as well as Weapon Focus with that weapon.
