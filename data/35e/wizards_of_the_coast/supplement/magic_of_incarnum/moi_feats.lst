DESC:Forge a link between you and power-rich planar locations, referred to as planar touchstones.																							STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																												SOURCEPAGE:p.207	BENEFIT:Choose any site designated as a planar touchstone for which you also possess an object native to that location, as noted in this feat's prerequisite. When this feat is first taken, forging a link between yourself and a chosen planar touchstone takes 24 hours of uninterrupted concentration. To forge a link, you must spend 10 experience points and expend the object described in this feat's prerequisite. Once the link is forged, you gain the base ability described for that touchstone. If you physically visit the planar location once you've forged a link, you also gain a higher-order ability with a limited number of uses, as described for that planar touchstone. You can repeatedly visit the planar touchstone, each time recharging your usages of the higher-order ability. Usages of a higher-order ability do not stack, so visiting your planar touchstone prior to using up any of your higher-order usages confers no additional benefit. Once you've established a link with one planar touchstone site by taking this feat, you can also freely visit other planar touchstones. When you do so and fulfill the higher-order ability's recharge condition for the alternate site, you immediately gain the base ability of the new planar touchstone site and lose the base ability of the previous site. You also lose any remaining uses of the higher-order ability of your previously selected site (if any), and instead gain the specified number of higher-order ability uses appropriate to the new site. In this way, you can "unplug" from one site and "plug in" to a new planar touchstone site as often as you desire. Thus, after expending the raw materials and experience points for making your first connection, making subsequent connections with different sites is as easy as fulfilling the higherorder recharge condition. Special: You can take this feat more than once. Each time, you gain the base ability to retain one more planar touchstone location in addition to your previous ability. You also gain the capacity to retain uses of one more planar touchstone's higher-order ability.
