Race Traits ~ Rilkan							CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																																																										ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=Rilkan Race Trait
Racial Knowledge		KEY:Rilkan ~ Racial Knowledge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Rilkan Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:The rilkan race is linked through the power of incarnum to the accumulated knowledge of their entire people. This manifests in two ways. First, all Knowledge checks are treated as trained skill checks for rilkans, regardless of whether they actually have ranks in the skill. Even without formal instruction, a rilkan naturally absorbs learning from the accumulated knowledge of her people. Second, rilkans gain a competence bonus on all Knowledge checks and bardic knowledge checks. This bonus is +1, but increases by an additional +1 for every two soulmelds currently shaped by the rilkan, since each soulmeld contains a small portion of the collected souls of the rilkan race.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.12

Race Traits ~ Skarn							CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																																																										ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=Skarn Race Trait
Natural Weapon (Spines)	KEY:Skarn ~ Natural Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Skarn Race Trait.SpecialQuality		DESC:A skarn can make one attack with his arm spines each round, either with his primary hand or with his off-hand (taking the normal penalties for fighting with an off-hand weapon). This attack deals 1d6 points of piercing damage; if it is used as an off-hand weapon, the skarn may add only one-half his Strength bonus to the damage roll. A skarn can't attack with his spines and a weapon wielded by the same arm in the same round. If a skarn makes a spine attack with an arm carrying a shield, he loses the shield's bonus to AC until the start of his next turn. If the skarn has a soulmeld bound to his arms chakra, his spine attacks are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. See Chakra Binds, page 51, for details.											SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Racial Skill		KEY:Skarn ~ Racial Skill		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Skarn Race Trait.SpecialQuality		DESC:+2 racial bonus on Intimidate and Climb checks: Skarns learn quickly how to use their spines to create a display of ferocity.

Meldshaping				KEY:Incarnate ~ Meldshaping				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:An incarnate's primary ability is shaping incarnum soulmelds, which are drawn from the incarnate soulmeld list (page 54). You know and can shape any soulmeld from this list (but see Aligned Soulmelds, below). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an incarnate soulmeld is 10 + number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld + your Wisdom modifier. Your meldshaper level is equal to your incarnate level. An incarnate can shape only a certain number of soulmelds per day. Your base daily allotment is given on Table 2-2: The Incarnate. The maximum number of soulmelds that you can have shaped simultaneously is equal to your Constitution score minus 10 or the number of soulmelds allowed for your level, whichever is lower. At 1st level, you can shape two soulmelds at a time (assuming you have a Constitution score of at least 12). As you advance in level, you can shape an increasing number of soulmelds. At 1st level, you also gain access to your personal pool of essentia, which can be invested into your soulmelds to increase their power. Your essentia pool's size is shown on Table 2-2: The Incarnate. Your character level, as noted on Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity, determines the maximum quantity of essentia that you can invest in any single soulmeld. As a swift action, you can reallocate your essentia investments in your soulmelds every round (see Essentia, page 50). An incarnate does not study or prepare soulmelds in advance, but must have a good night's rest and must meditate for 1 hour to shape his soulmelds for the day (see Shaping Soulmelds, page 49).

Aligned Soulmelds			KEY:Incarnate ~ Aligned Soulmelds			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:You cannot shape soulmelds with an alignment descriptor that does not match your own. For example, if you are a good incarnate, you cannot shape soulmelds with the chaotic, lawful, or evil descriptors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Chakra Binds			KEY:Incarnate ~ Chakra Binds				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can bind your soulmelds to your chakras, granting you new powers based on the soulmeld and the chakra chosen. Binding a soulmeld to a chakra closes the body slot associated with that chakra (see Chakras , page 50), so that you cannot also benefit from a magic item worn on the body slot associated with that chakra. The number of chakra binds that you can have active at any one time depends on your level (see the Chakra Binds column on Table 2-2: The Incarnate). At 2nd level, you can bind a soulmeld to your crown chakra. Beginning at 4th level, you can bind soulmelds to your feet or hands chakras. At 9th level, you can bind soulmelds to your arms, brow, or shoulders chakras. At 14th level, you can bind soulmelds to your throat or waist chakras. At 16th level, you can bind a soulmeld to your heart chakra, and at 19th level you can bind a soulmeld to your soul chakra.

Aura					KEY:Incarnate ~ Aura					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:You have a particularly powerful aura corresponding to your alignment (see the detect evil spell). The power of your aura is equal to your incarnate level, just like the aura of a cleric. Similarly, your soulmelds always radiate good, evil, law, or chaos (according to your alignment) as though they were aligned magic items with a caster level equal to your class level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Detect Opposition			KEY:Incarnate ~ Detect Opposition			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At will, you can attempt to detect the presence of creatures whose alignment is opposite your own. This ability works like the detect evil spell, except that it detects the specific alignment opposed to your own. For example, a good incarnate can detect evil, while a chaotic incarnate can detect law.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Expanded Soulmeld Capacity	KEY:Incarnate ~ Expanded Soulmeld Capacity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:ExpandedSoulmelds|0		DESC:Incarnates are specially gifted in their ability to invest essentia into soulmelds. At 3rd level and again at 15th level, the essentia capacity of your soulmelds increases by 1, superseding the number on Table 2-1. This only applies to soulmelds, not to feats, class features, or other abilities that allow essentia investment.

Incarnum Radiance			KEY:Incarnate ~ Incarnum Radiance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:IncarnumRadianceTimes|0	DESC:As an incarnate, you fuse incarnum with your very soul. You can tap into your incarnum-fused soul to activate a visible radiant aura of power, granting you an increase in a particular area of prowess. You can activate this ability as a free action once per day at 3rd level, twice per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day for every five levels gained thereafter (3/day at 13th level and 4/day at 18th). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round).	DESC:&nl;Good: Your body shines with silvery light. You gain a +1 bonus to AC; this bonus improves by 1 for every five levels gained (+2 at 5th level, +3 at 10th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 20th level).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Incarnate Alignment Focus (Good)	DESC:&nl;Evil: An ash-gray aura surrounds you.

Rapid Meldshaping			KEY:Incarnate ~ Rapid Meldshaping			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:RapidMeldshapingTimes|0	DESC:As your ability to channel incarnum into soulmelds increases, you learn to shape a small number of soulmelds instantly. Starting at 5th level, once per day you can unshape one of your existing soulmelds and immediately shape another soulmeld. This process requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity. The soulmeld that you shape cannot be bound to a chakra, even if the soulmeld that you unshape was bound to a chakra. You can use this ability twice per day at 11th level and three times per day at 17th.

Share Incarnum Radiance		KEY:Incarnate ~ Share Incarnum Radiance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:As you gain control over your powers of incarnum, you learn to share the effect of your incarnum radiance with nearby allies who share at least some of your morals or ethics. Beginning at 7th level, when you activate your incarnum radiance (see above) you can choose for its benefit to also affect all allies within 30 feet of you. Any ally who moves more than 30 feet from you loses the benefit until he returns within range. If you share your incarnum radiance with allies in this fashion, you become fatigued at the end of the power's duration (this fatigue fades in 10 minutes). You must make this choice at the time the radiance is activated. Allies who do not share your alignment cause cannot gain the benefit of your incarnum radiance. For example, a good incarnate's incarnum radiance benefit cannot be shared with allies who are not good. Beginning at 17th level, sharing your incarnum radiance with allies does not fatigue you.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Perfect Meldshaper		KEY:Incarnate ~ Perfect Meldshaper			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 20th level, you gain the ability to flood your body with incarnum for a brief period of time. As a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can increase the amount of essentia invested in each of the incarnate soulmelds that you currently have shaped to the maximum essentia capacity of that soulmeld. This total will be greater than the amount of essentia normally available to you. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. During this duration, you can't reallocate essentia from your incarnate soulmelds. You can use this ability once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.22
True Incarnation			KEY:Incarnate ~ True Incarnation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnate Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:When you reach 20th level, the process of merging incarnum with your flesh is complete, and you are transformed into a new type of creature. You gain the outsider type, as well as the alignment subtype corresponding to your incarnate cause. Both your natural and weapon attacks are henceforth treated as having the alignment of that subtype for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and deal 1 extra point of damage per soulborn level. These bonuses apply only against creatures whose alignment opposes at least one component of yours-a lawful good soulborn smites chaotic and evil foes (any creature whose alignment includes either chaos or evil), while a chaotic good soulborn smites lawful and evil foes. If you accidentally smite a creature of the wrong alignment, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, you can smite opposition one additional time per day to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.

The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability one additional time per day for every four levels gained above 9th (2/day at 13th level and 3/day at 17th).

Totem Chakra Bind			KEY:Totemist ~ Totem Chakra Bind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Totemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 2nd level, you gain access to a unique chakra: the totem chakra. This chakra is not associated with any location on the body, but rather represents your connection to the wild soul energy of nature, embodied in the magical beasts of the world. When you bind a soulmeld to your totem chakra, you take on characteristics of the creature represented by the meld-usually involving a limited physical transformation. Since the totem chakra doesn't match a body location, binding a soulmeld to this chakra doesn't restrict your use of magic items that take up a body location. Any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra has an essentia capacity 1 higher than the normal capacity for your soulmelds. For example, a 2nd-level totemist can invest up to 2 points of essentia in any soulmeld bound to his totem chakra bind (rather than the normal limit of 1 points of essentia). At 15th level, the capacity of any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra increases by an additional point (meaning that a 15th-level totemist could invest up to 5 points of essentia in that soulmeld). At 6th level, the effective meldshaper level of a soulmeld you have bound to your totem chakra is equal to your actual meldshaper level +1. The primary effect of this benefit is to make that soulmeld harder to unshape. At 11th level, you gain the ability to bind a single soulmeld to your totem chakra and to another chakra at the same time. You gain the special benefits of both chakra binds.

Wild Empathy			KEY:Totemist ~ Wild Empathy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Totemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:As the druid class ability; see page 35 of the Player's Handbook. You gain a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks made to influence the reactions of magical beasts of the same kind as the beast associated with the soulmeld bound to your totem chakra. Thus, if you have a basilisk mask bound to your totem chakra, you gain the bonus on checks made to influence basilisks.

Illiteracy				KEY:Totemist ~ Illiteracy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Totemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Like barbarians, totemists do not begin the game knowing how to read and write. You can spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages you are able to speak. If you gain a level in any other class (except barbarian), you automatically gain literacy. A barbarian who gains a totemist level remains illiterate. Any other character who gains a totemist level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.

Starting at 8th level, once per day you can unbind a soulmeld from your totem chakra and bind a different meld to that chakra, as long as the new meld is one you already have shaped. This requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability one additional time for every four levels gained above 8th (2/day at 12th level, 3/day at 16th, and 4/day at 20th).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.30
Totem Embodiment			KEY:Totemist ~ Totem Embodiment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Totemist Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 20th level, you gain the ability to temporarily link your body and soul to your totem chakra. This greatly enhances the power of essentia invested in soulmelds bound to that chakra. For the duration of this ability, your normal essentia capacity of any soulmeld bound to your totem chakra is doubled. Every point of essentia invested in a soulmeld bound to your totem chakra counts as 2 points of essentia. Activating this ability is a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can be used once per day and lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution bonus (minimum 1).

They float slightly above your shoulders, leaving room for clothing and other armor. In battle, these pauldrons seem to draw attacks toward them, steering blows away from your most vital areas. The use of adamant pauldrons carries a stigma in some incarnate circles because of the example of Murthien the Soul-Render. The infamous incarnate is said to have worn adamant pauldrons on which the tormented visages of imprisoned souls were clearly visible, wracked with pain from the necrocarnum energies Murthien wielded. Wise incarnates refuse to allow the corrupted practice of one notable individual to prevent them from employing a highly useful soulmeld, however. Your adamant pauldrons grant you protection from physical attacks. Whenever a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a 25%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. Essentia: You gain damage reduction equal to the number of points of essentia invested in this soulmeld. This damage reduction is bypassed only by attacks of an alignment opposed to that of your incarnate cause (good, evil, chaos, or law). Thus, if you invest 3 points of essentia in your adamant pauldrons and you are a good incarnate, you gain damage reduction 3/evil.

While worn, the airstep sandals allow you to fly up to 10 feet (good maneuverability) as a move action once per round. You must end the flight solidly supported or you fall.

Arcane Focus					KEY:Incarnate Soulmeld ~ Arcane Focus					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.Incarnate.IncarnateChakraThroat																																																																						DESC:A necklace of blue crystals fits around your neck. The crystals shed a faint glow that increases in brightness when you cast a damaging spell. Drawing upon the soul energy of spellcasters and warmages, meldshapers who also cast arcane spells can use the incarnum energy to intensify spells that cause harm to others. You shape incarnum into a periapt or other trinket, known as an arcane focus, which you then wear about your neck. When you cast an arcane spell that deals damage, your spell's damage is increased by 1 point. Spells that divide their damage among multiple targets, such as magic missile, deal the extra damage once to each affected target. This soulmeld does not affect spells that do not deal damage. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your arcane focus increases the extra damage by 1 point.

The ends of the torc resemble black or copper dragons facing each other in front of your throat. A constant bitter taste floods your mouth, but it seems to make the flavor of certain foods more enjoyable-particularly well-cooked meat. The infamous incarnate Murthien the Soul-Render, for all his forays into the abomination that is necrocarnum, also used dissolving spittle almost as a calling card. While this meld is favored by chaotic and evil incarnates because of acid's association with both suffering and dissolution, incarnates of all alignments find acidic spittle a useful weapon against a variety of opponents. As a standard action, you can spit a glob of acid at a target within 30 feet. This requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Using dissolving spittle provokes attacks of opportunity. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your dissolving spittle increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) Instead of a torc around your neck, the writhing shape of a twoheaded dragon arcs around your throat in blue-green scales. Tendrils of midnight blue extend up your neck and down into your shoulders like diseased veins.

The ends of the torc resemble black or copper dragons facing each other in front of your throat. A constant bitter taste floods your mouth, but it seems to make the flavor of certain foods more enjoyable-particularly well-cooked meat. The infamous incarnate Murthien the Soul-Render, for all his forays into the abomination that is necrocarnum, also used dissolving spittle almost as a calling card. While this meld is favored by chaotic and evil incarnates because of acid's association with both suffering and dissolution, incarnates of all alignments find acidic spittle a useful weapon against a variety of opponents. As a standard action, you can spit a glob of acid at a target within 30 feet. This requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Using dissolving spittle provokes attacks of opportunity. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your dissolving spittle increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points.

The incarnum used to shape an incarnate avatar comes from the outer-planar embodiments of the incarnate's alignment and takes their form. In shaping this meld, incarnates hope to transcend their own mortal frames and attain the perfect embodiment of their alignment ideals represented by the avatar. The appearance of your incarnate avatar depends on your alignment. Chaos: Your incarnate avatar resembles a blue slaad. The slaad form is hulking and brutish, with enormous claws and a toothy maw.

Incarnate Weapon					KEY:Incarnate Soulmeld ~ Incarnate Weapon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraArms.Incarnate.IncarnateChakraArms																																																																							DESC:Incarnum forms into a one-handed melee weapon that embodies your alignment. The weapon seems large for your hand, but it is balanced perfectly for you to wield it. Clutching it in your hand, you feel it resonate with your deepest convictions and firmest beliefs, and it hums with power. In the hands of an incarnate, alignment is literally a weapon. The incarnate Phanallashtam the Lawbringer is remembered almost as much for the Sword of Law he used to smite the Chaos Dragon as for the legal code he introduced to the world at the birth of civilization. Phanallashtam claimed that the two were one and the same: The Sword of Law was all law in metallic form, slicing through disorder with a sharp, clean cut. You shape incarnum into a melee weapon (sized normally for you despite its overlarge appearance) that is particularly harmful to creatures of the opposing alignment. Damage you deal with the weapon gains the alignment descriptor matching your devoted cause and penetrates damage reduction accordingly. Chaotic incarnates create a battleaxe, evil incarnates create a flail, good incarnates create a warhammer, and lawful incarnates create a longsword. Nonproficiency penalties never apply to the use of an incarnate weapon, though any feats with effects that apply to a particular kind of weapon (such as Weapon Focus) function normally. Your incarnate weapon cannot be sundered or otherwise destroyed (except by effects that unshape soulmelds). If your incarnate weapon leaves your hand for any reason, it returns to your grasp at the beginning of your next turn. If that is impossible, it falls at your feet (but attempts to return again on your next turn). Any other creature attempting to wield your incarnate weapon gains none of its special benefits (but can wield it as a normal weapon of that kind). Incarnate weapon is treated as a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful effect, based on your alignment. Essentia: The incarnate weapon gains an enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in it.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Arms) Bands of steel form around your forearms.

The weapon seems large for your hand, but it is balanced perfectly for you to wield it. Clutching it in your hand, you feel it resonate with your deepest convictions and firmest beliefs, and it hums with power. In the hands of an incarnate, alignment is literally a weapon. The incarnate Phanallashtam the Lawbringer is remembered almost as much for the Sword of Law he used to smite the Chaos Dragon as for the legal code he introduced to the world at the birth of civilization. Phanallashtam claimed that the two were one and the same: The Sword of Law was all law in metallic form, slicing through disorder with a sharp, clean cut. You shape incarnum into a melee weapon (sized normally for you despite its overlarge appearance) that is particularly harmful to creatures of the opposing alignment. Damage you deal with the weapon gains the alignment descriptor matching your devoted cause and penetrates damage reduction accordingly. Chaotic incarnates create a battleaxe, evil incarnates create a flail, good incarnates create a warhammer, and lawful incarnates create a longsword. Nonproficiency penalties never apply to the use of an incarnate weapon, though any feats with effects that apply to a particular kind of weapon (such as Weapon Focus) function normally. Your incarnate weapon cannot be sundered or otherwise destroyed (except by effects that unshape soulmelds). If your incarnate weapon leaves your hand for any reason, it returns to your grasp at the beginning of your next turn. If that is impossible, it falls at your feet (but attempts to return again on your next turn). Any other creature attempting to wield your incarnate weapon gains none of its special benefits (but can wield it as a normal weapon of that kind). Incarnate weapon is treated as a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful effect, based on your alignment. Essentia: The incarnate weapon gains an enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in it.

Mantle of Flame					KEY:Incarnate Soulmeld ~ Mantle of Flame					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraShoulders.Incarnate.IncarnateChakraShoulders																																																																					DESC:You shape incarnum into a cloak of wispy blue flame. The cloak covers your arms and almost closes in front of you, where a band of fire crosses over your heart to connect the cloak's two edges. The fire does not harm you, though it keeps you as warm and dry as any heavy cloak in cold or rainy weather. A thirst for vengeance burns like fire in many souls, and a mantle of flame gives that metaphor literal truth: vengeance turned to flame. While you wear your mantle of flame, any creature that strikes you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as long spears, are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The mantle of flame grants shadowy illumination in your space, but provides no further lighting. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your mantle of flame increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your mantle of flame burns particularly brightly around your shoulders, forming a high collar behind your head and neck. As a standard action, you can briefly expand the mantle of flame to encompass all adjacent squares.

Necrocarnum Circlet				KEY:Incarnate Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Circlet				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.Incarnate.IncarnateChakraCrown																																																																							DESC:Necrocarnum bends itself into a matte black crown that seems to consume light. The fractured remnants of souls broken by the power of necrocarnum float within this soulmeld. These forms barely surface in this dark and foreboding crown, yet even the faintest glimpse is unsettling. You form necrocarnum into a dark circlet that rests on your head like a crown. The circlet allows you to detect nearby undead, bolster their turn resistance, and even animate a necrocarnum zombie. While this soulmeld is shaped, you unerringly detect the presence and position of undead creatures within 30 feet. This ability functions like the blindsight ability, except that it detects only undead creatures. Essentia: Undead within a 30-foot radius gain turn resistance equal to the number of points of essentia that you invest in the soulmeld. If you animated the undead, the turn resistance is equal to double the number of points of invested essentia.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) A matching coil of necrocarnum forms around the head of a corpse. Filled with the dark power of necrocarnum, the corpse shambles to its feet, its flesh and mind overtaken by the curse of undeath. A necrocarnum zombie resembles a shambling corpse with black motes of light slowly swimming under its rotting skin. When you shape this soulmeld and bind it to your crown chakra, you can cause it to animate a corpse within 30 feet as a necrocarnum zombie (see page 186). The affected creature's Hit Dice cannot exceed your meldshaper level. This requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity; in addition, you take damage equal to the necrocarnum zombie's Hit Dice, which may not be healed as long as the zombie remains animated. As long as you have essentia invested in the soulmeld, the necrocarnum zombie's essentia pool is increased by the same quantity. The animated zombie can act immediately on your turn. You have complete control over the zombie as long as you maintain line of effect. Should this line of effect be broken, the zombie acts on its own accord to carry out your last instructions. You reestablish control as soon as you reestablish line of effect. You can have only one necrocarnum zombie animated at any given time. Animating a second turns the original into an inert corpse. If this soulmeld is unshaped, any necrocarnum zombie created by it returns to an inert corpse.

Faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadow, tortured and twisted shapes that once might have been human. These apparitions writhe and buckle, wracked by incomprehensible agony. Their tortured, elongated faces hold their gaping mouths open in soundless eternal screams. You form a cloak of necrocarnum that surrounds you with necromantic energy.

While you have a necrocarnum mantle shaped, you gain immunity to disease. Shaping the mantle does not affect any disease that you might already have. Essentia: As you invest essentia in the necrocarnum mantle, necrocarnum floods through your mind, granting you the ability to shake off mental effects. For every point of essentia you invest in your necrocarnum mantle, you gain a +1 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

If a living creature dies while adjacent to you, the bonus instead lasts for a number of rounds equal to the creature's Hit Dice. Essentia: If you invest essentia in the necrocarnum shroud, the area encompassed by the life-draining field expands. Any living creature who takes damage (or dies) within 5 feet plus 5 feet per point of essentia invested triggers the bonus. (For example, if you've invested 2 points of essentia, you would gain the bonus for any living creature taking damage or dying within 15 feet of you.)

When you use this ability, you must make a successful melee touch attack against the intended victim. If successful, your touch bestows 1d4 negative levels on the target (Fortitude half). For each negative level bestowed, you gain 1 temporary point of essentia and 5 temporary hit points. The temporary essentia lasts until the end of your next turn.

While you have necrocarnum touch shaped, you gain a +4 profane bonus on Sleight of Hand checks (as well as the ability to use the skill untrained) and on Bluff checks made to feint in combat.

These vestments cling tightly to your shoulders, but drape loosely over the rest of your body, obscuring other garments behind an ever-shifting screen of terror. As with all necrocarnum melds, faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadowy vestment. These tortured apparitions seem wracked by incomprehensible agony, their elongated faces wrenched open in eternal screams. Necrocarnum vestments bind necrocarnum into a shadowy robe. This strange soulmeld deadens both flesh and spirit, granting you a resistance to cold as well as an unholy ability to withstand physical blows. When bound closer to your spirit, the vestments can shed a radius of killing frost or even shield you from deadly necromantic effects. When you have necrocarnum vestments shaped, you gain resistance to cold 5 as the energies of necrocarnum deaden your flesh to the effects of cold. Essentia: For every point of essentia invested in the necrocarnum vestments, you gain 3 bonus hit points. These are not temporary hit points and are not depleted first as are temporary hit points.

These vestments cling tightly to your shoulders, but drape loosely over the rest of your body, obscuring other garments behind an ever-shifting screen of terror. As with all necrocarnum melds, faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadowy vestment. These tortured apparitions seem wracked by incomprehensible agony, their elongated faces wrenched open in eternal screams. Necrocarnum vestments bind necrocarnum into a shadowy robe. This strange soulmeld deadens both flesh and spirit, granting you a resistance to cold as well as an unholy ability to withstand physical blows. When bound closer to your spirit, the vestments can shed a radius of killing frost or even shield you from deadly necromantic effects. When you have necrocarnum vestments shaped, you gain resistance to cold 5 as the energies of necrocarnum deaden your flesh to the effects of cold. Essentia: For every point of essentia invested in the necrocarnum vestments, you gain 3 bonus hit points. These are not temporary hit points and are not depleted first as are temporary hit points. You can render yourself staggered, unconscious, or even dead by changing the quantity of essentia invested in this soulmeld.

The chasuble is little more than a large circle with a hole in the center for your head, but raw incarnum is woven like blue thread into intricate patterns down its front. The planar chasuble binds the raw material of another plane to the garment and infuses it with power. When you wear the chasuble, you are considered a native on any plane with an alignment trait matching your chosen alignment (and gain the extraplanar subtype while on the Material Plane). While on such a plane, you ignore the effect of any alignment traits of the plane (see page 149 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). For example, a lawful incarnate who shapes this soulmeld would be considered native to any plane with the lawful trait, including the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia and the Nine Hells of Baator. You also gain resistance 10 to a specific energy type, based on your alignment. Chaotic incarnates gain resistance to electricity 10, evil incarnates gain resistance to acid 10, good incarnates gain resistance to cold 10, and lawful incarnates gain resistance to fire 10.

The amulet itself resembles a large blue sapphire carved into the shape of a scarab beetle holding a solar disk between its front legs. The planar ward soulmeld duplicates some of the effects of spells such as protection from evil and dismissal, but incarnates through the ages have argued that the soulmeld is actually the earlier form of this warding magic. In fact, some have argued that planar ward was the first soulmeld ever shaped, long before the principles of incarnum were fully understood, as the ancestors of the humanoid races sought protection from forces greater than themselves. Your planar ward protects you from mental control. It blocks any attempt to possess you (by a magic jar attack, for example) or exercise mental control over you, including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over you. The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting you, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the planar ward's effect. If you were to unshape your planar ward while the effect granting mental control continued, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command you. Likewise, the planar ward keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the soulmeld is shaped. Essentia: The planar ward provides a morale bonus on saves made to resist the supernatural or spell-like abilities of extraplanar creatures. The bonus is equal to the number of points of essentia invested in the soulmeld.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) Your planar ward takes the form of a glowing blue orb embedded in the base of your throat.

Necrocarnum Weapon				KEY:Incarnate Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Weapon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraHands.Incarnate.IncarnateChakraHands																																																																							DESC:Shadowy threads of necrocarnum bind to your melee weapon. This dark energy seems to ripple beneath the surface of the weapon, pulsing irregularly from your hands to the tip of the weapon and back again. You bind the taint of necrocarnum to a melee weapon. The energies enable you to penetrate the damage of some goodaligned creatures, deal extra damage with the weapon, and even strike directly at the soul energy of those you hit. When you shape this soulmeld, choose a melee weapon that you hold. As long as the soulmeld is shaped, the weapon bypasses damage reduction as if it were evil-aligned. The soulmeld remains shaped if you put the weapon down or if another creature wields it, but other creatures do not benefit from any of the soulmeld's effects, including the benefits of essentia investment or binding it to a chakra. The weapon suffers no ill effects from shaping or unshaping the soulmeld. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your necrocarnum weapon, you gain a +1 profane bonus on damage rolls and on attack rolls made to confirm a critical threat. Both of these bonuses apply only when the weapon is used against a living creature.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Hands) When you strike a living creature in a particularly vulnerable area, necrocarnum floods from your weapon into the victim. At the same time, pure blue soul energy, incarnum unsullied by the taint of necrocarnum, flows into you, granting you a temporary increase in power. When you have a necrocarnum weapon soulmeld bound to your hands chakra and you successfully make a critical hit with the weapon on a living creature, you gain temporary essentia equal to the number of points of essentia invested in this soulmeld. You can use this essentia normally, but it fades after 10 rounds. (Multiple uses of this ability don't stack.)

When you have a necrocarnum weapon soulmeld bound to your hands chakra and you successfully make a critical hit with the weapon on a living creature, you gain temporary essentia equal to the number of points of essentia invested in this soulmeld. You can use this essentia normally, but it fades after 10 rounds. (Multiple uses of this ability don't stack.) This ability works normally for critical hits delivered when making a coup de grace attack.

This dark energy seems to ripple beneath the surface of the weapon, pulsing irregularly from your hands to the tip of the weapon and back again. You bind the taint of necrocarnum to a melee weapon. The energies enable you to penetrate the damage of some goodaligned creatures, deal extra damage with the weapon, and even strike directly at the soul energy of those you hit. When you shape this soulmeld, choose a melee weapon that you hold. As long as the soulmeld is shaped, the weapon bypasses damage reduction as if it were evil-aligned. The soulmeld remains shaped if you put the weapon down or if another creature wields it, but other creatures do not benefit from any of the soulmeld's effects, including the benefits of essentia investment or binding it to a chakra. The weapon suffers no ill effects from shaping or unshaping the soulmeld. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your necrocarnum weapon, you gain a +1 profane bonus on damage rolls and on attack rolls made to confirm a critical threat. Both of these bonuses apply only when the weapon is used against a living creature.

The mask is initially featureless, with a simple horizontal slot at your mouth, but subtle images shift across its surface as you interact with others. Silvertongue masks were used by some of the first incarnates to gain the favor of neighboring tribes and nations by providing familiar and comforting images to accompany diplomatic pleas. The soulmeld draws on the souls of quick-witted and slick-tongued heroes, helping to guide the meldshaper in beguilement or negotiation. You shape incarnum into a silver-blue mask that you wear over your face. Your silvertongue mask grants you a +2 insight bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks.

DESC:&nl;Chakra Bind (Throat) The silver mask melds into your face and neck, from your cheekbones down to your collar, as if your skin were turned to silver. When you attempt to compel a creature, that creature sees a face that is recognizable, but not quite familiar. When bound to the throat chakra, the silvertongue mask allows you to make a suggestion (as the spell) to any creature as a standard action. A successful Will save negates this effect. A creature targeted by this ability, regardless of whether or not it succeeds on its save, can't be targeted again by the same ability for 24 hours.

While featureless, it seems to emote using its own brilliance, ranging from an angry burn to a contented glow. Soulspark familiars are nearly constant companions of some meldshapers, filling the role of a loyal defender, a confidant, a guard, or sometimes simply a light to show the way. You shape a small mote of soul energy called a least soulspark, which accompanies you and can attack your foes at your direction. The presence of the soulspark grants you the Alertness feat. The soulspark follows you, typically hovering near your shoulder. If the soulspark is more than 10 feet from you at the end of its turn, it unshapes. You can communicate empathically with the soulspark, and directing it to attack a creature is a free action. A soulspark familiar whose creator is incapable of issuing new directions follows its last command as long as it is able, after which it returns to hover over its creator. If the soulspark is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the meld unshapes. The least soulspark is a new creature detailed on page 197. A soulspark formed by this soulmeld does not have the incarnum shroud ability normally possessed by such creatures, nor does it have an essentia pool. Essentia: When you allocate essentia to your soulspark familiar, you can select one of the following effects. All essentia invested must be put toward the same effect. Align Attack: The first point of essentia invested makes the soulspark's attack good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose, allowing it to bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment. Every point beyond the first grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on damage against any creature of the opposing alignment. Attack Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on its attack rolls and damage rolls. Deflection Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class. Healing: Every point of essentia invested grants the soulspark a certain amount of fast healing. A least soulspark gains fast healing equal to 1 ? the points of essentia invested, a lesser soulspark gains fast healing equal to 2 ? the points of essentia invested, a standard soulspark gains fast healing equal to 3 ? the points of essentia invested, and a greater soulspark gains fast healing equal to 4 ? the points of essentia invested.

When you wear it, you feel energized and revitalized. When you are struck by an attack that would damage your ability scores, a wave of incarnum energy passes through you, blunting the effectiveness of the attack. The strongheart vest protects you from attacks that would reduce your ability scores. Any time you would take ability damage, such as Constitution damage or Strength damage, the amount of the damage is reduced by 1 point, to a minimum of 0. For example, if you fail a saving throw against the poison of a monstrous centipede and would normally take 2 points of Dexterity damage from its poison, you take 1 point instead. Ten rounds later, if you fail a second saving throw against the poison and would normally take 1 point of Dexterity damage, you take no Dexterity damage instead.

For example, if you have 3 points of essentia invested in this soulmeld, you will subtract 4 points from any ability damage dealt to you.

This soulmeld amplifies spells and effects that repair the physical form. You shape incarnum into a sheath of energy that sinks into your skin and helps to focus healing magic that targets you. Whenever you are the target of a spell or effect that heals hit point damage, the spell heals additional damage equal to its spell level. For example, if you are targeted by a cure serious wounds spell cast by a 7th-level cleric, you would be healed of 3d8+10 points of damage (7 points for the cleric's caster level and 3 points for the spell's level). Essentia: Every point of essentia invested increases the additional healing by 2 more hit points.

A stirring of air at your feet disturbs nearby dust. The wind cloak coaxes the spirit energy of incarnum to swirl around your body, creating a wind that might deflect small objects or even larger airborne projectiles. The swirling soul energy around you protects you from ranged attacks, absorbing some of the momentum of projectiles and other ranged weapons. You gain damage reduction 2/magic against ranged weapons. (This soulmeld doesn't grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction.) The damage reduction granted by wind cloak applies against all ranged weapons regardless of their size. Tiny and smaller flying creatures that attempt to enter your space must succeed on a Fortitude save to do so. Failure means their movement stops adjacent to your space, and any remaining movement left in their action is lost. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested increases the damage reduction by 2.

The crystals shed a faint glow that increases in brightness when you cast a damaging spell. Drawing upon the soul energy of spellcasters and warmages, meldshapers who also cast arcane spells can use the incarnum energy to intensify spells that cause harm to others. You shape incarnum into a periapt or other trinket, known as an arcane focus, which you then wear about your neck. When you cast an arcane spell that deals damage, your spell's damage is increased by 1 point. Spells that divide their damage among multiple targets, such as magic missile, deal the extra damage once to each affected target. This soulmeld does not affect spells that do not deal damage. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your arcane focus increases the extra damage by 1 point.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) Barely visible wisps of incarnum writhe from your arcane focus, tendrils of soul energy that twist into arcane symbols as you cast arcane spells. When you cast a damaging spell, the spell is accompanied by a blue-white burst of raw incarnum energy. The energy and power behind your offensive spells can temporarily overcome your opponents. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage to a single living creature, that creature must succeed on a Fortitude save (using the soulmeld's save DC, not the spell's) or be dazed for 1 round. If the spell deals damage to more than one creature, or if the target creature takes no damage from the spell (whether because of a successful saving throw, spell resistance, or resistance to the damage dealt by the spell), this has no effect.

The substance of this helm is transparent crystal with a faceted appearance. As it rests over your head, you can almost feel a barrier erected behind your eyes, barring the way to those who would intrude into your mind. Crystal in its many forms is frequently associated with mental powers, hence its widespread use by characters with psionic powers. With this soulmeld, you shape incarnum into a crystalline form to draw on its protective qualities. The soulmeld provides protection against mental effects, granting you a +2 resistance bonus on Will saving throws against charm and compulsion. Essentia: You can increase the protective properties granted by a crystal helm by investing essentia in the soulmeld. You gain a deflection bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of points of essentia that you invest in the crystal helm.

The light clearly outlines the shapes of creatures and objects it illuminates, enhancing your visual acuity. The light of souls is pure, highlighting the nuances of physical forms. This soulmeld draws upon that power to shed light on the meldshaper's surroundings. You shape incarnum into a circlet that illuminates the area around you. Your diadem of purelight sheds light as a torch, illuminating a 20-foot radius with bright illumination (and out to a 40-foot radius of shadowy illumination). Creatures gain a +2 insight bonus on Spot checks when attempting to see anything within the radius of illumination (including within the shadowy illumination). For the purpose of interacting with darkness spells, the diadem of purelight is treated as a light spell of a level equal to its invested essentia. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your diadem of purelight increases the radius of illumination by 10 feet. The radius of shadowy illumination is always double the radius of bright illumination. For example, a diadem of purelight with 2 points of invested essentia sheds bright light to a radius of 40 feet, and shadowy illumination to a radius of 80 feet.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) The light from the headband becomes steady and constant, amplifying the contrast between different creatures and objects.

Fear, some would argue, is among the most powerful forces in the multiverse.

With a flash, the dice disappear a moment after they stop rolling, and you sense that your luck is changing. The dice are a metaphor, a physical representation of the forces of luck-good luck, in this case. They draw upon favorable spirit energy to grant you a small boon. You can use your lucky dice as a swift action, choosing an aspect of yourself to which to apply extra luck. You gain a +1 luck bonus on one of the following, at your option: attack rolls and damage rolls, saving throws, or skill and ability checks. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn. When using this meld, roll 2d6. If the result is any combination of numbers that add up to 7, the luck bonus applies to all of the listed types of rolls. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in the lucky dice at the time you activate its special ability increases the duration of the luck bonus by 1 round. Because lucky dice can be rolled every round, it's possible for the soulmeld to provide bonuses to more than one type of check during a given round.

The metal gleams a burnished blue. Spikes and blades jut out in various places from these gauntlets, each one whispering an ancient battle cry in your mind. Mauling gauntlets are said to channel the fierce power of warriors throughout history. While wearing mauling gauntlets, you gain a +2 morale bonus on Strength checks (but not on Strength-based skill checks), such as those to break down doors or to bull rush an opponent.

DESC:Chakra Bind (Arms) Your mauling gauntlets extend winding bands of blue steel up past your elbows, almost to your shoulders. In places, these bands of metal seem fused with your skin.

This does not stack with any other effect that increases a weapon's threat range, such as the Improved Critical feat or the keen weapon special quality.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Hands) Rather than actual gauntlets, this soulmeld transforms your hands into hard blue metal.

Necrocarnum Circlet				KEY:Soulborn Soulmeld ~ Necrocarnum Circlet				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.Soulborn.SoulbornChakraCrown																																																																							DESC:Necrocarnum bends itself into a matte black crown that seems to consume light. The fractured remnants of souls broken by the power of necrocarnum float within this soulmeld. These forms barely surface in this dark and foreboding crown, yet even the faintest glimpse is unsettling. You form necrocarnum into a dark circlet that rests on your head like a crown. The circlet allows you to detect nearby undead, bolster their turn resistance, and even animate a necrocarnum zombie. While this soulmeld is shaped, you unerringly detect the presence and position of undead creatures within 30 feet. This ability functions like the blindsight ability, except that it detects only undead creatures. Essentia: Undead within a 30-foot radius gain turn resistance equal to the number of points of essentia that you invest in the soulmeld. If you animated the undead, the turn resistance is equal to double the number of points of invested essentia.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) A matching coil of necrocarnum forms around the head of a corpse. Filled with the dark power of necrocarnum, the corpse shambles to its feet, its flesh and mind overtaken by the curse of undeath. A necrocarnum zombie resembles a shambling corpse with black motes of light slowly swimming under its rotting skin. When you shape this soulmeld and bind it to your crown chakra, you can cause it to animate a corpse within 30 feet as a necrocarnum zombie (see page 186). The affected creature's Hit Dice cannot exceed your meldshaper level. This requires a full-round action and provokes attacks of opportunity; in addition, you take damage equal to the necrocarnum zombie's Hit Dice, which may not be healed as long as the zombie remains animated. As long as you have essentia invested in the soulmeld, the necrocarnum zombie's essentia pool is increased by the same quantity. The animated zombie can act immediately on your turn. You have complete control over the zombie as long as you maintain line of effect. Should this line of effect be broken, the zombie acts on its own accord to carry out your last instructions. You reestablish control as soon as you reestablish line of effect. You can have only one necrocarnum zombie animated at any given time. Animating a second turns the original into an inert corpse. If this soulmeld is unshaped, any necrocarnum zombie created by it returns to an inert corpse. No creature can be affected by the necrocarnum circlet more than once.

Faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadow, tortured and twisted shapes that once might have been human. These apparitions writhe and buckle, wracked by incomprehensible agony. Their tortured, elongated faces hold their gaping mouths open in soundless eternal screams. You form a cloak of necrocarnum that surrounds you with necromantic energy.

While you have a necrocarnum mantle shaped, you gain immunity to disease. Shaping the mantle does not affect any disease that you might already have. Essentia: As you invest essentia in the necrocarnum mantle, necrocarnum floods through your mind, granting you the ability to shake off mental effects. For every point of essentia you invest in your necrocarnum mantle, you gain a +1 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

You force necrocarnum to shape a life-draining field around you. While you have the necrocarnum shroud shaped, you gain a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls any time a living creature takes damage while adjacent to you. This bonus lasts for 1 round. If a living creature dies while adjacent to you, the bonus instead lasts for a number of rounds equal to the creature's Hit Dice. Essentia: If you invest essentia in the necrocarnum shroud, the area encompassed by the life-draining field expands. Any living creature who takes damage (or dies) within 5 feet plus 5 feet per point of essentia invested triggers the bonus. (For example, if you've invested 2 points of essentia, you would gain the bonus for any living creature taking damage or dying within 15 feet of you.)

While you have necrocarnum shroud bound to your soul chakra, you can take a standard action to strike a living foe with the raw evil of necrocarnum. When you use this ability, you must make a successful melee touch attack against the intended victim. If successful, your touch bestows 1d4 negative levels on the target (Fortitude half). For each negative level bestowed, you gain 1 temporary point of essentia and 5 temporary hit points. The temporary essentia lasts until the end of your next turn. The temporary hit points fade after 1 hour.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Waist) The shadowy tendrils of necrocarnum that surround you seem to reach out toward nearby creatures.

These insubstantial coils of energy hint at evil and agony, seeming to draw light and hope out of the surrounding area. You call upon dark powers to twist and torture the soul energy that is incarnum. The result, a cloying, sickly energy of great evil, twines itself around your hands and arms, allowing you to disguise some of your movements, draw the life force directly from living creatures, or even fill the air with bolts of pure necrocarnum. The coiling energy makes the movements of your hands and arms hard to follow. While you have necrocarnum touch shaped, you gain a +4 profane bonus on Sleight of Hand checks (as well as the ability to use the skill untrained) and on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Essentia: Whenever you invest essentia in necrocarnum touch, you can use the dark energy to inflict damage on living creatures. You can make a melee touch attack as a standard action.

These vestments cling tightly to your shoulders, but drape loosely over the rest of your body, obscuring other garments behind an ever-shifting screen of terror. As with all necrocarnum melds, faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadowy vestment. These tortured apparitions seem wracked by incomprehensible agony, their elongated faces wrenched open in eternal screams. Necrocarnum vestments bind necrocarnum into a shadowy robe. This strange soulmeld deadens both flesh and spirit, granting you a resistance to cold as well as an unholy ability to withstand physical blows. When bound closer to your spirit, the vestments can shed a radius of killing frost or even shield you from deadly necromantic effects. When you have necrocarnum vestments shaped, you gain resistance to cold 5 as the energies of necrocarnum deaden your flesh to the effects of cold. Essentia: For every point of essentia invested in the necrocarnum vestments, you gain 3 bonus hit points. These are not temporary hit points and are not depleted first as are temporary hit points. You can render yourself staggered, unconscious, or even dead by changing the quantity of essentia invested in this soulmeld.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Heart) Black necrocarnum energy coalesces around your heart.

DESC:Chakra Bind (Waist) Necrocarnum binds to your flesh, sheathing you in a sinister web of energy.

These vestments cling tightly to your shoulders, but drape loosely over the rest of your body, obscuring other garments behind an ever-shifting screen of terror. As with all necrocarnum melds, faint forms seem to swim in the depths of this shadowy vestment. These tortured apparitions seem wracked by incomprehensible agony, their elongated faces wrenched open in eternal screams. Necrocarnum vestments bind necrocarnum into a shadowy robe. This strange soulmeld deadens both flesh and spirit, granting you a resistance to cold as well as an unholy ability to withstand physical blows. When bound closer to your spirit, the vestments can shed a radius of killing frost or even shield you from deadly necromantic effects. When you have necrocarnum vestments shaped, you gain resistance to cold 5 as the energies of necrocarnum deaden your flesh to the effects of cold.

This dark energy seems to ripple beneath the surface of the weapon, pulsing irregularly from your hands to the tip of the weapon and back again. You bind the taint of necrocarnum to a melee weapon. The energies enable you to penetrate the damage of some goodaligned creatures, deal extra damage with the weapon, and even strike directly at the soul energy of those you hit. When you shape this soulmeld, choose a melee weapon that you hold. As long as the soulmeld is shaped, the weapon bypasses damage reduction as if it were evil-aligned. The soulmeld remains shaped if you put the weapon down or if another creature wields it, but other creatures do not benefit from any of the soulmeld's effects, including the benefits of essentia investment or binding it to a chakra. The weapon suffers no ill effects from shaping or unshaping the soulmeld. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your necrocarnum weapon, you gain a +1 profane bonus on damage rolls and on attack rolls made to confirm a critical threat. Both of these bonuses apply only when the weapon is used against a living creature.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Hands) When you strike a living creature in a particularly vulnerable area, necrocarnum floods from your weapon into the victim. At the same time, pure blue soul energy, incarnum unsullied by the taint of necrocarnum, flows into you, granting you a temporary increase in power. When you have a necrocarnum weapon soulmeld bound to your hands chakra and you successfully make a critical hit with the weapon on a living creature, you gain temporary essentia equal to the number of points of essentia invested in this soulmeld.

The mask is initially featureless, with a simple horizontal slot at your mouth, but subtle images shift across its surface as you interact with others. Silvertongue masks were used by some of the first incarnates to gain the favor of neighboring tribes and nations by providing familiar and comforting images to accompany diplomatic pleas. The soulmeld draws on the souls of quick-witted and slick-tongued heroes, helping to guide the meldshaper in beguilement or negotiation. You shape incarnum into a silver-blue mask that you wear over your face. Your silvertongue mask grants you a +2 insight bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your silvertongue mask increases the insight bonus by 2.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Brow) Blue crystalline lenses grow out from the mask, covering your eyes.

DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) The silver mask melds into your face and neck, from your cheekbones down to your collar, as if your skin were turned to silver. When you attempt to compel a creature, that creature sees a face that is recognizable, but not quite familiar. When bound to the throat chakra, the silvertongue mask allows you to make a suggestion (as the spell) to any creature as a standard action. A successful Will save negates this effect. A creature targeted by this ability, regardless of whether or not it succeeds on its save, can't be targeted again by the same ability for 24 hours.

While featureless, it seems to emote using its own brilliance, ranging from an angry burn to a contented glow. Soulspark familiars are nearly constant companions of some meldshapers, filling the role of a loyal defender, a confidant, a guard, or sometimes simply a light to show the way. You shape a small mote of soul energy called a least soulspark, which accompanies you and can attack your foes at your direction. The presence of the soulspark grants you the Alertness feat. The soulspark follows you, typically hovering near your shoulder. If the soulspark is more than 10 feet from you at the end of its turn, it unshapes. You can communicate empathically with the soulspark, and directing it to attack a creature is a free action. A soulspark familiar whose creator is incapable of issuing new directions follows its last command as long as it is able, after which it returns to hover over its creator. If the soulspark is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the meld unshapes. The least soulspark is a new creature detailed on page 197. A soulspark formed by this soulmeld does not have the incarnum shroud ability normally possessed by such creatures, nor does it have an essentia pool. Essentia: When you allocate essentia to your soulspark familiar, you can select one of the following effects. All essentia invested must be put toward the same effect. Align Attack: The first point of essentia invested makes the soulspark's attack good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose, allowing it to bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment. Every point beyond the first grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on damage against any creature of the opposing alignment. Attack Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on its attack rolls and damage rolls. Deflection Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class. Healing: Every point of essentia invested grants the soulspark a certain amount of fast healing. A least soulspark gains fast healing equal to 1 ? the points of essentia invested, a lesser soulspark gains fast healing equal to 2 ? the points of essentia invested, a standard soulspark gains fast healing equal to 3 ? the points of essentia invested, and a greater soulspark gains fast healing equal to 4 ? the points of essentia invested.

Align Attack: The first point of essentia invested makes the soulspark's attack good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as you choose, allowing it to bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment. Every point beyond the first grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on damage against any creature of the opposing alignment. Attack Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 bonus on its attack rolls and damage rolls. Deflection Bonus: Every point of essentia grants the soulspark a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class. Healing: Every point of essentia invested grants the soulspark a certain amount of fast healing. A least soulspark gains fast healing equal to 1 ? the points of essentia invested, a lesser soulspark gains fast healing equal to 2 ? the points of essentia invested, a standard soulspark gains fast healing equal to 3 ? the points of essentia invested, and a greater soulspark gains fast healing equal to 4 ? the points of essentia invested.

A faint voice whispers in your mind, translating the words that you hear. This soulmeld draws on the linguistic talents of creatures living and dead to translate an unfamiliar language. Choose a language when you shape your soulspeaker circlet. While the soulmeld is shaped, you can understand the spoken forms of that language. This does not provide you the ability to speak, read, or write that language. Essentia: For every point of essentia invested in soulspeaker circlet, you can select an additional language that you understand.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) The circlet merges with your flesh, remaining visible as a band of blue across your forehead, similar to a tattoo. The whispers in your mind now translate your own thoughts, telling you the words you must speak to be understood. The soulspeaker circlet grants you the ability to speak those languages for which it grants understanding. You still cannot read or write these languages.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) The circlet extends tendrils that reach down your head to wrap around your neck. Your words can now be translated directly into thought. As you communicate telepathically with others, those creatures perceive a slight pulsing radiance emanating from the soulmeld. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within a range of 20 feet per point of invested essentia, as long as that creature has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. This is a mind-affecting effect.

While featureless, it seems to emote using its own brilliance, ranging from an angry burn to a contented glow. Soulspark familiars are nearly constant companions of some meldshapers, filling the role of a loyal defender, a confidant, a guard, or sometimes simply a light to show the way. You shape a small mote of soul energy called a least soulspark, which accompanies you and can attack your foes at your direction. The presence of the soulspark grants you the Alertness feat. The soulspark follows you, typically hovering near your shoulder. If the soulspark is more than 10 feet from you at the end of its turn, it unshapes. You can communicate empathically with the soulspark, and directing it to attack a creature is a free action. A soulspark familiar whose creator is incapable of issuing new directions follows its last command as long as it is able, after which it returns to hover over its creator. If the soulspark is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the meld unshapes. The least soulspark is a new creature detailed on page 197. A soulspark formed by this soulmeld does not have the incarnum shroud ability normally possessed by such creatures, nor does it have an essentia pool.

When you wear it, you feel energized and revitalized. When you are struck by an attack that would damage your ability scores, a wave of incarnum energy passes through you, blunting the effectiveness of the attack. The strongheart vest protects you from attacks that would reduce your ability scores. Any time you would take ability damage, such as Constitution damage or Strength damage, the amount of the damage is reduced by 1 point, to a minimum of 0. For example, if you fail a saving throw against the poison of a monstrous centipede and would normally take 2 points of Dexterity damage from its poison, you take 1 point instead. Ten rounds later, if you fail a second saving throw against the poison and would normally take 1 point of Dexterity damage, you take no Dexterity damage instead. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your strongheart vest further reduces ability damage by an additional point. For example, if you have 3 points of essentia invested in this soulmeld, you will subtract 4 points from any ability damage dealt to you.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Heart) Tendrils of blue-black webbing snake out from the vest, merging with your flesh.

Ankheg Breastplate				KEY:Totemist Soulmeld ~ Ankheg Breastplate				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraThroat.ChakraTotem.Totemist.TotemistChakraThroat.TotemistChakraTotem																																																																	DESC:A thick, chitinous breastplate forms around your torso. The green plates of the armor glisten like the thorax of a living insect. Soft tissue and living muscle bind the plates together, rather than the chain and leather of conventional armor. Ankhegs are burrowing predators protected by thick plates of chitin. The totemist tradition reveres them as protectors, but it also seeks to claim the destructive power of their mandibles and their acidic spittle. Your ankheg breastplate grants you a +2 armor bonus to your Armor Class. As always, this bonus does not stack with an armor bonus from a different source (such as actual armor you might be wearing). If you have another armor bonus, the higher bonus applies. This soulmeld has no maximum Dexterity bonus, armor check penalty, or arcane spell failure. It is treated as light armor for the purpose of determining your speed and adjudicating class features dependent on armor. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your ankheg breastplate, the armor bonus granted by the soulmeld improves by 1.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) Green chitin spreads from your breastplate up your neck, blending into your skin there. This thickened skin seems to pulse slowly, in a rhythm unrelated to the beat of your heart or the movement of your breath. You gain the ability to spit a line of acid as a standard action. Once per minute, you can emit a line of acid that is 5 feet long plus 5 feet per point of invested essentia. Targets in the line take 2d6 points of acid damage plus 1d6 points for every point of invested essentia. They can reduce this damage by half with a successful Reflex save.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Green-brown chitin spreads from your breastplate up your neck to your face, and you sprout serrated mandibles like those of a giant insect. Outside of combat, they slowly open and close without any conscious direction. In battle, you can use these terrible clenching jaws to tear the flesh of your foes. When you shift essentia to this soulmeld, the mandibles sizzle with acid. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll). Every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld adds 1d4 points of acid damage to your bite damage.

The visage is reptilian, with a protruding lower jaw and teeth jutting upward. Bony spines stick up from the top of the mask, completing the portrait of a basilisk. While the basilisk is feared primarily for its petrifying gaze, totemists also revere it as a patron of vision. Your basilisk mask grants you low-light vision. Essentia: The basilisk mask grants you darkvision with a range of 30 feet per point of essentia invested in the soulmeld.

If you concentrate, you can hear a very quiet murmur of growls, shrieks, and other animal noises-the cacophony of the beast world. Rather than channeling the specific soul energy of a particular kind of magical beast to emulate that beast, totemists sometimes prefer to use incarnum in a more general way to improve their interactions with all beasts. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your beast tamer circlet increases the insight bonus by 2.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) Your silver circlet fuses to your head, sending silver-blue tendrils like tiny veins under your skin. The endless clamor of beast noises becomes intelligible to you-you understand the range of needs and emotions that drives these utterances-but you are still able to ignore it with a modicum of concentration.

DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Instead of a gleaming silver band around your head, your beast tamer circlet manifests as a ring of silver hair, while all the hair on your head becomes long and coarse like a beast's mane.

The color is darker on the back and fades to pale blue in the front, and bands of gray-brown line the top and bottom. The gorget tapers to a sharp point above your breastbone. Powerful beasts that resemble dragons, behirs are revered for their dangerous electrical breath weapon. Their dozen legs grant them stability, a quality totemists seek to appropriate through this soulmeld. Their hatred of dragons makes this a popular soulmeld for totemists planning to slay a dragon-particularly a blue or bronze dragon. Your behir gorget gives you a +4 bonus to resist being bull rushed or tripped. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your behir gorget, it protects you from electricity damage. You gain resistance to electricity equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) Your armored collar merges into your throat, and your neck lengthens very slightly. You can feel a constant tingling in the sides of your neck, and tiny sparks occasionally spit from your mouth when you speak-particularly when you get excited or angry.

Once per minute, you can emit a line of lightning that is 5 feet long plus 5 feet per point of invested essentia. Targets in the line take 2d6 points of electricity damage plus 1d6 per point of invested essentia, and they can reduce this damage by half with a successful Reflex save.

The shirt seems to shift and move on its own, and it fades into a barely corporeal mist near your waist. Most disconcerting of all, patches of the garment seem transparent, as if they have temporarily shifted to some strange elsewhere. Because different parts of the garment appear phased out at different times, these patches of incorporeality seem to roam over the surface of the shirt. Blink dogs have two closely related abilities that define their hunting tactics. Totemists emulate both their shortrange teleportation and the blinking that gives them their name. Good-aligned totemists and those planning to fight displacer beasts shape this meld, invoking the blink dog's natural good alignment and their hatred for those creatures. By shaping incarnum into a shirt resembling blink dog fur, you gain the ability to teleport (as dimension door) up to 10 feet at will. Using this ability is a standard action. After using this ability, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You cannot bring along other creatures; you affect only yourself.

Bloodtalons						KEY:Totemist Soulmeld ~ Bloodtalons						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraHands.ChakraTotem.Totemist.TotemistChakraHands.TotemistChakraTotem																																																																		DESC:Incarnum forms a pair of eagle talons around your hands. They are ghostly and insubstantial, almost like a violet mist surrounding your hands, but the three-toed shape is as clear as the sharp claws in their outline. Blood hawks (described in the Fiend Folio) are fierce birds of prey noted for their blood lust. They are similar to sharks in their frenzy while feeding-in fact, they fight beyond the threshold of death. Totemists who shape bloodtalons hope to emulate the ferocious tenacity, keen eyesight, and sheer savagery of these creatures. You can continue to fight without penalty if you are disabled or dying. When reduced to 0 hit points, you can act as if you weren't disabled (that is, you ignore the normal restriction to only a single move or standard action per turn). You do not lose 1 hit point for performing a standard or otherwise strenuous action while at 0 hit points. When reduced to -1 to -9 hit points, you do not fall unconscious. You do not automatically lose 1 hit point each round when at -1 to -9 hit points. When your current hit points drop to -10 or lower, you immediately die. Essentia: You gain a +2 bonus on Spot checks per point of essentia you invest in your bloodtalons.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Hands) Rather than being surrounded by violet mist, your hands themselves turn a deep shade of violet, like the blue of incarnum mixed with rich blood red. Somehow, your hands feel eager to grasp and tear, to speed past your opponents' defenses and tear at their eyes. You gain the benefit of the Weapon Finesse feat when attacking with natural weapons.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) The skin of your hands becomes red-orange and scaly like the talons of a blood hawk, your fingers grow knobby and strong, and your nails lengthen into fierce talons with sharp points and edges. You can use your bloodtalons as natural weapons. You can make two claw attacks that each deal 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. On the round after you hit with a claw attack, the wounds bleed for an additional 1 point of damage per point of essentia you had invested in your bloodtalons when you made the attack. Nonliving creatures are immune to this blood loss effect. Every point of essentia invested in the bloodtalons grants a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls made with the claw attacks. While the claws are shaped, you can still use your hands as normal (to hold items, cast spells, and so on), although you cannot hold an item in your hand and attack with the claws at the same time.

The silver scales of the mask glint and gleam in the light, and the tongue seems to sway of its own accord. Disenchanters (described in the Fiend Folio) are huge, surly beasts that feed on magical energy. By shaping this soulmeld, totemists hope to gain the power to combat magic-particularly against foes armed with large numbers of magic items. You can use a detect magic effect as the spell, with a range of 10 feet. You can use this ability as often as desired, but no more than once per round (as a standard action). Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your disenchanter mask, the range of its detect magic effect increases by 10 feet.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Brow) Your disenchanter mask binds to your forehead, and your eyes replace the glassy black eyes in the mask's sockets. Colors seem somehow more alive to your sight-particularly the colors of spell effects and items that you know to be magical. When using this soulmeld's detect magic ability, you can instantly determine the number, strength, and location of each magical aura present as if you had been concentrating for 3 rounds. You must still make Spellcraft checks as normal to determine the school of magic involved in each aura.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Your face lengthens and shapes into the mask you wear, and the dangling tongue of the mask becomes your own tongue. As you extend it, you can practically taste magic in the air, and when you use the tongue to drain magic, it tastes strong and sweet, almost like a liqueur. You can use the long tongue of your disenchanter mask to make a melee touch attack as a standard action. (You cannot use the tongue as a natural secondary weapon, nor can you make any other attacks in the same round as you make a tongue attack.) The tongue has a reach 5 feet longer than your natural reach, but you cannot use it to make attacks of opportunity. It uses your normal base attack bonus. If you hit with the tongue attack, you deal no damage but have a chance to temporarily suppress a magic item that the target might have. Unless you choose a specific item held or worn by the target (such as "the sword he holds" or "his bracers"), you affect magic items in the following order: shield, armor, helmet, item in hand, cloak, stowed or sheathed weapon, bracers, clothing, jewelry (including rings), and anything remaining. To suppress the item, you must succeed on a meldshaper level check (1d20 + your meldshaper level) against a DC of 11 + the magic item's caster level. Success means that the item's magical properties are suppressed for 10 minutes. You can also use this ability to temporarily suppress the magic of a specific soulmeld, but you must specify the soulmeld to be affected; otherwise you affect a magic item instead. Use the soulmeld's meldshaper level as its caster level.

Essentia: The competence bonus on Hide checks increases by 2 for every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Shoulders) As you bind the mantle to your shoulders, its midnight hue spreads into the skin of your shoulders and upper arms.

Short spines protrude from this shell, and light gleams from its surface. Though it has no actual protective value (unless you bind it to your heart chakra), the carapace fills you with the destructive power of the tarrasque. Possibly the most dreaded of all magical beasts, the tarrasque is also the only magical beast whose power is channeled and embodied in two different soulmelds-dread carapace and totem avatar. Totemists who shape dread carapace can emulate a variety of the tarrasque's many aspects-primary among them its sheer power in melee combat. While your dread carapace is shaped, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls when you are using a bite attack, or a +1 bonus when you are using a claw or other natural attack. In exchange, you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls with natural weapons. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your dread carapace increases your attack penalty by 1 and your damage bonus by 2 (for bite attacks) or 1 (for other natural weapons). Thus, if you invest 5 points of essentia in this soulmeld, you take a -6 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +12 bonus on damage rolls with a bite, or +6 with a different natural weapon.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Arms) While the appearance of your dread carapace is unchanged, your upper arms manifest scaly plates, while spikes emerge from your elbows. At the same time, any natural weapons you possess become more deadly-sharper, longer, better able to slice through skin and armor to tear at vulnerable flesh. The threat range of any natural attacks you possess (either naturally or as a result of another soulmeld) is doubled. This doesn't stack with any other effect that increases the threat range of your natural weapon.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Feet) While the appearance of your dread carapace is unchanged, your legs become increasingly muscular, and their shape alters slightly so that you more naturally move on just your toes and the balls of your feet. Once per minute, you can add an enhancement bonus of +60 feet to your speed for 1 round. This enhancement bonus is increased by 10 feet for every point of essentia invested in your dread carapace.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Heart) Your dread carapace takes on a highly reflective sheen, suggesting the tarrasque's ability to reflect spells back on their casters. Spells have a hard time reaching through your carapace to affect you. You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + 4 per point of essentia you invest in your dread carapace.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Two mighty horns jut from your head. Though they are useless in combat, they alter your appearance, making your countenance quite fearsome. When you charge, your visage suggests something utterly inhuman, striking fear into the hearts of your foes. When you charge, all enemies within 60 feet who can see you become shaken for 1 round (Will negates).

Short spines protrude from this shell, and light gleams from its surface. Though it has no actual protective value (unless you bind it to your heart chakra), the carapace fills you with the destructive power of the tarrasque. Possibly the most dreaded of all magical beasts, the tarrasque is also the only magical beast whose power is channeled and embodied in two different soulmelds-dread carapace and totem avatar. Totemists who shape dread carapace can emulate a variety of the tarrasque's many aspects-primary among them its sheer power in melee combat. While your dread carapace is shaped, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls when you are using a bite attack, or a +1 bonus when you are using a claw or other natural attack. In exchange, you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls with natural weapons. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your dread carapace increases your attack penalty by 1 and your damage bonus by 2 (for bite attacks) or 1 (for other natural weapons). Thus, if you invest 5 points of essentia in this soulmeld, you take a -6 penalty on attack rolls and gain a +12 bonus on damage rolls with a bite, or +6 with a different natural weapon.

Frost Helm						KEY:Totemist Soulmeld ~ Frost Helm						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraCrown.ChakraTotem.Totemist.TotemistChakraCrown.TotemistChakraTotem																																																																		DESC:Incarnum forms into a bluewhite helm resembling the bizarre head of a frost worm. It floats above the top of your head, its strange lumpy shape rising to a tall nodule at the front and top. Frost worms are terrible arctic predators known for the weird stunning trill they produce from the nodules atop their heads. Totemists in cold lands favor this soulmeld, claiming the frost worm's power to protect themselves from the cold environment. They also use frost helm to mimic the frost worm's trill and its frigid breath weapon. Because of the frost worm's legendary hatred for the remorhaz, totemists don this meld when leading remorhaz hunting parties. While wearing a frost helm, you can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 90? Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. Your equipment is likewise protected. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your frost helm, it also protects you from cold damage. You gain resistance to cold equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) Your frost helm fuses to the top of your head, actually opening a breathing channel in the strange nodule at the helm's crown. As a standard action, you can project a ray of cold energy from your forehead, reminiscent of a frost worm's breath weapon. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit a creature with this ray. If you hit, the ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage plus an additional 1d6 points for every point of essentia you invest in your frost helm.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Your frost helm fuses to your head and seems to spread downward, changing the appearance of your upper face to resemble the head of a frost worm. Your eyes meld into the helm's strange nodule, your cheeks twist into lumpy protrusions, and the skin of your face grows thick and blue-white. As a standard action, you can produce a trilling sound that stuns opponents within 20 feet. You can target one creature plus one additional creature per point of essentia you invest in your frost helm. Targets must succeed on a Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. If attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action), a victim is allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it cannot be affected by your frost helm's trill for 24 hours. Frost worms are immune to this effect.

The mask's eyes are empty black pits. Totemists revere the gorgon as an icon of passive strength and endurance. Its steel-plated hide and great fortitude, as well as its association with petrification, signify the unyielding strength of a cliff wall standing against the sea. At the same time, its aggressive nature leads totemists to emulate the gorgon's ability to crush its foes beneath its hooves. While wearing a gorgon mask, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on Fortitude saves and a +2 resistance bonus on any check or saving throw to resist being bull rushed, tripped, overrun, or trampled. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your gorgon mask increases your resistance bonuses by 1.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) The dusky, metallic scales of your gorgon mask extend down your neck, forming a sharp ridge along your upper spine. Wisps of green smoke escape from your mouth. You gain the ability to breathe a cloud of petrifying gas on an adjacent foe. If the target fails a Fortitude save, it turns to stone, as the flesh to stone spell. You can use this ability once per day.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) The metallic scales of your gorgon mask extend down over your shoulders, lending bulk and solidity to your frame. You feel strength coursing through your legs in particular, giving you the ability to run down your foes and crush them beneath your feet. You gain the ability to make a trample attack. As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed and literally run over any creature equal to your own size or smaller. You merely have to move over the opponents in your path; any creature whose space is completely covered by your space is subject to the trample attack. If a target's space is larger than 5 feet, it is considered trampled only if you move over all the squares it occupies. Your trample attack deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small) plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. If you are larger than Medium or smaller than Small, the damage scales up or down accordingly (see page 114 of the Player's Handbook). Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a -4 penalty. (Opponents whose space is larger than 5 feet and whom you do not trample can also make attacks of opportunity at the same penalty.) An opponent can give up its attack of opportunity and instead attempt a Reflex save to take half damage from your trample. You can deal trampling damage to each target only once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.

You feel warmth spreading from the stone into your body, though it is not enough to ward off extreme cold. At the sight of a frost giant or some other creature of cold, however, that warmth surges through your body like consuming fire, eager to sear your opponents' flesh. The remorhaz is one of the most fearsome predators of arctic regions. Unlike many creatures native to those realms, it is not immune to cold damage; it endures the extremes of winter temperatures by generating huge amounts of heat. Totemists shape this soulmeld when fighting frost giants (since the remorhaz considers frost giants to be prey) and when they hunt large game in cold climes.

You feel warmth spreading from the stone into your body, though it is not enough to ward off extreme cold. At the sight of a frost giant or some other creature of cold, however, that warmth surges through your body like consuming fire, eager to sear your opponents' flesh. The remorhaz is one of the most fearsome predators of arctic regions. Unlike many creatures native to those realms, it is not immune to cold damage; it endures the extremes of winter temperatures by generating huge amounts of heat. Totemists shape this soulmeld when fighting frost giants (since the remorhaz considers frost giants to be prey) and when they hunt large game in cold climes. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures with the cold subtype. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your heart of fire increases your insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against cold creatures by 1.

It is smooth and sleek to the touch, and it lets you glide through water as if you were born to it. An evil ruler of the aquatic depths, the kraken is, above all, a fast and competent swimmer. Totemists revere the creature and claim its abilities to swim and breathe water, as well as the power of its many arms for grabbing and grappling. A kraken mantle greatly enhances your ability to swim, giving you a +8 competence bonus on Swim checks. With a successful Swim check, you can move at up to your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-half your speed (as a move action). Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your kraken mantle increases your effective speed for the purposes of swimming by 5 feet. For example, if you have a base land speed of 30 feet and invest 4 points of essentia in your kraken mantle, you can swim 50 feet (30 + [4 ? 5 feet]) as a full-round action or 25 feet as a move action.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Arms) The smooth, sleek substance of your mantle spreads down to your upper arms, becoming one with your flesh. Your arms themselves grow slightly more flexible, helping you gain purchase on a grappled foe. They also gain a measure of constricting strength, helping you squeeze the life from your enemies just as the kraken does. You gain a bonus on grapple checks equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your kraken mantle.

Leathery skin encases your legs up to your knees, and enormous claws extend from the front of your feet. The bulette, also called the landshark, is closely associated with the earth in totemist traditions. Totemists channel the spirit energy of the bulette to attain connection with the earth-borrowing a measure of its tremorsense or its ability to burrow through the earth-as well as to mimic its fearsome qualities as a voracious predator. While wearing the landshark boots, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Jump checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in the landshark boots increases the competence bonus on Jump checks by 2.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Feet) The leathery skin of your landshark boots extends up to the middle of your thighs, and your legs thicken and grow stronger. The boots transmit vibrations from the earth into your feet, allowing you to sense the movement of nearby creatures. As long as you are touching the ground, you can take a move action to sense the number of creatures within 10 feet that are also touching the ground and the direction to each one. You cannot pinpoint the location of any creature with this ability. Every point of essentia you invest in your landshark boots extends the range of your limited tremorsense by 5 feet.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Your hands as well as your feet gain the heavy claws of a bulette, including one prominent central claw and two smaller claws on the sides.

You cannot use a shield while these claws are in place. For every point of essentia you invest in your landshark boots, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with these claws. If, as part of a move, you achieve a Jump check result good enough to make a 5-foot high jump while within reach of an opponent, you can attack that opponent with all four claws as a standard action. You use the same attack bonus for all four attacks. You cannot make any other attacks in the same round, whether from natural weapons or manufactured weapons.

Phase spiders are magical beasts that resemble spiders, and they represent all of spiderkind in totemist thinking. They are associated with mobility of all sorts, from their ability to climb walls to their ethereal phasing power. You gain a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks. In addition, you can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened, and you retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class while climbing. Essentia: For every point of essentia you invest in your phase cloak, your competence bonus on Climb checks increases by 2.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your phase cloak becomes even more like a silvery gray liquid, seeming to flow like a gentle stream even when completely motionless. Its mottled blue markings also extend to the skin of your shoulders and upper torso. When you use a move action to move at least 5 feet, you can become ethereal during the movement. Among other effects, this means that you can cross difficult terrain without penalty and even pass through walls. While moving, you are not subject to attacks of opportunity except from creatures that can see into the Ethereal Plane and affect ethereal creatures. However, you become material after each move. Thus, if you perform a double move, you must end your first move in a space where you can return to the Material Plane before becoming ethereal again for the second part of your move. If you are within a solid object when your etherealness ends, you are immediately shunted to the nearest open space, taking 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel. While using this ability, you are subject to possible attack by creatures on the Ethereal Plane. As a general guideline, the DM should roll once on the Ethereal Plane Encounters table (page 152 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) for each encounter during which you use this ability, with a result of 01-80 indicating that no danger lurks on the Ethereal Plane in that location.

This soulmeld is most popular among totemists native to hot desert and jungle lands. Your phoenix belt protects you from harm in hot environments. You can exist comfortably in conditions between 40 and 140? Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. Your equipment is likewise protected. The phoenix is a magical beast detailed in Monster Manual II. Essentia: If you invest essentia in your phoenix belt, it also protects you from fire damage. You gain resistance to fire equal to 5 times the number of points of essentia you invest in this soulmeld.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Waist) You have a very palpable sense of fire burning within you, but in a pleasant, comforting way, much like a heated stone warming a cold bed at night. When subjected to fire damage, the feathers of your phoenix belt flare up briefly, as coals fanned by a breeze. You can turn fire damage into fast healing. Whenever your resistance to fire (whether from this soulmeld or another source) reduces the damage dealt to you by a fire-based attack, you gain fast healing 1 for a number of rounds equal to the amount of damage negated by your resistance. For example, if you were hit with a fireball for 22 points of damage and had resistance to fire 10, you would gain fast healing 1 for 10 rounds (since your resistance negated 10 points of damage). If instead you were hit with burning hands for 6 points of damage, you would gain fast healing 1 for only 6 rounds (since your resistance negated only 6 points of damage). The fast healing granted by this chakra bind doesn't stack with itself (or with any other kind of fast healing). If this chakra bind would grant you fast healing from a second source of fire damage, use only the longer remaining duration.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Now it is no longer just the feathers in your phoenix belt that seem to glow like hot coals, but your eyes and, to an extent, your skin as well. Your eyes burn red, and your skin gives off a soft heat like a warm hearth. With a moment's concentrated effort, however, that fire can be made real around you, and quite painful to those who threaten you. As a standard action, you can create a momentary ring of fire that surrounds you. Creatures adjacent to you take 1d6 points of fire damage per point of essentia you invest in your phoenix belt. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half.

Rageclaws						KEY:Totemist Soulmeld ~ Rageclaws						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Soulmeld.ChakraHands.ChakraTotem.Totemist.TotemistChakraHands.TotemistChakraTotem																																																																		DESC:You form incarnum into a pair of furred gloves tipped with short claws. These gloves fit over your hands as well as any other gloves or gauntlets you might wear. When you clench your hands into fists, you can feel a surge of anger and determination well up inside you. The rageclaws soulmeld makes no attempt to channel soul energy from any particular kind of magical beast. Rather, it taps into the primal rage and survival instinct shared by all creatures of that type, a powerful will to survive and prevail. Totemists typically shape this meld when they expect to face overwhelming odds, but some totemists shape it simply to gain courage and fury in battle. While you wear your rageclaws, you can continue to fight without penalty if you are disabled or dying. When reduced to 0 hit points, you can act as if you weren't disabled (that is, you ignore the normal restriction to only a single move or standard action per turn). You do not lose 1 hit point for performing a standard or otherwise strenuous action while at 0 hit points. When reduced to -1 to -9 hit points, you do not fall unconscious. You do not automatically lose 1 hit point each round when at -1 to -9 hit points. When your current hit points drop to -10 or lower, you immediately die. Essentia: Investing essentia in rageclaws increases the range of negative hit points at which you can continue functioning. Every point of essentia invested effectively reduces the point at which you die by 3 (such as from -10 to -13). You can continue to fight without penalty until you reach that hit point total. If your essentia investment in this soulmeld is reduced (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) and your current hit point total is at or below the point at which you would die, you immediately die. For example, if you are currently at -16 hit points and reduce your essentia investment from 3 points to 2 points, you would die (since your new point of death would be -16).	DESC:Chakra Bind (Hands) The fur of your rageclaws merges into your hands, and your fingers become tipped with small, dark claws instead of nails. Each blow that lands on your body causes a blood rage to swell up in you, building until you are near death and then erupting in desperate fury. While your hit point total is below 0, you gain a +2 morale bonus on melee attack rolls, melee weapon damage rolls, and Fortitude saves. Though similar in some ways to a barbarian's rage, this state applies no restriction on what actions you can take.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) The fur of your rageclaws merges into your hands, and your fingers become tipped with long, sharp claws you can use to tear the flesh of your foes. You can use your rageclaws as a pair of natural weapons that deal 1d6 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. When you grapple an opponent, you can attack with both claws; these attacks are not subject to the usual -4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple. While the rageclaws are shaped, you can still use your hands as normal (to hold items, cast spells, and so on), although you cannot hold an item in your hand and attack with the claws at the same time. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with your claws for every point of essentia invested in this soulmeld.

As you move, the cloak writhes behind you, suggesting the movement of tentacles. It seems to collect shadow, always appearing darker than the surrounding area.

Totemists in subterranean cultures are particularly partial to the shadow mantle soulmeld.

DESC:Chakra Bind (Shoulders) The shadows of your mantle deepen, and its coloration grows darker. Blackness seems to cling in every fold and sometimes trail off in wisps from the mantle's substance. You start to hear sounds too high for most humans to detect, and occasionally sounds too low, as well. As a swift action, you can surround yourself with a globe of magical darkness to a radius of 5 feet per point of invested essentia. You also gain blindsight with the same radius.

On the other hand, creatures beyond the radius of your darkness are invisible to you, but they can guess your location within the darkness.

Its presence lends a regal air to your bearing, and you feel yourself become more calm, more dignified, and more stable-emotionally and even physically grounded. A shedu (described in the Fiend Folio) is a noble beast related to the lammasu, distinguished by the crown it wears. With a human head atop the body of a five-legged bull, a shedu possesses a physical stability that reflects its moral purity and mental stamina as well. You are immune to being pushed back as the result of a bull rush, including the effects of spells such as Bigby's forceful hand and telekinesis (when used to perform a bull rush). Essentia: You gain a competence bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and effects equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your shedu crown.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) Your shedu crown settles firmly on your head, but its appearance is otherwise unchanged. You can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time. This is a mind-affecting effect.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Heart) The appearance of your shedu crown is unchanged, but when you use the power of this chakra bind, it briefly flares with brilliant silver light. You can shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane as a standard action and return to the Material Plane as a free action. Each day, you can spend a total number of rounds on the Ethereal Plane equal to your meldshaper level (each use counts as a minimum of 1 round). This ability otherwise functions as the ethereal jaunt spell.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Your hair grows into a bushy mane beneath your crown. If you are male, your beard likewise grows. Your body looks and feels more solid and strong. You gain the ability to make a trample attack. As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed and literally run over any creature equal to your own size or smaller. You merely have to move over the opponents in your path; any creature whose space is completely covered by your space is subject to the trample attack. If a target's space is larger than 5 feet, it is considered trampled only if you move over all the squares it occupies. Your trample attack deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small) plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. If you are larger than Medium or smaller than Small, the damage scales up or down accordingly (see page 114 of the Player's Handbook). Trampled opponents can attempt attacks of opportunity, but these take a -4 penalty. (Opponents whose space is larger than 5 feet and whom you do not trample can also take attacks of opportunity at the same penalty.) An opponent can also give up its attack of opportunity and instead attempt a Reflex save to take half damage from your trample. You can deal trampling damage to each target only once per round, no matter how many times your movement takes you over a target creature.

These magical claws seem almost alive, and they perfectly follow every move of your own hands and fingers. Sphinxes are among the most powerful and majestic of all magical beasts. In the view of some totemists, they embody what it is to be a magical beast. Totemists hold up different varieties of sphinx as the pinnacle of sphinxkind: the gruff and noble androsphinx, the clever and enigmatic gyno sphinx, the avaricious and powerful crio sphinx, or the detestable hieracosphinx. Whichever variety a totemist seeks to emulate, the effects of sphinx claws are the same-they make the totemist a clawing, pouncing terror to behold. While wearing sphinx claws, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Strength checks and Strength-based skill checks, such as Climb and Jump checks and checks made to break down doors or to bull rush an opponent. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in your sphinx claws increases the competence bonus by 1.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Hands) Your hands become one with the claws that surround them, overlarge for your size.

These magical claws seem almost alive, and they perfectly follow every move of your own hands and fingers. Sphinxes are among the most powerful and majestic of all magical beasts. In the view of some totemists, they embody what it is to be a magical beast. Totemists hold up different varieties of sphinx as the pinnacle of sphinxkind: the gruff and noble androsphinx, the clever and enigmatic gyno sphinx, the avaricious and powerful crio sphinx, or the detestable hieracosphinx. Whichever variety a totemist seeks to emulate, the effects of sphinx claws are the same-they make the totemist a clawing, pouncing terror to behold. While wearing sphinx claws, you gain a +1 competence bonus on Strength checks and Strength-based skill checks, such as Climb and Jump checks and checks made to break down doors or to bull rush an opponent.

As you turn your head, the mask does not turn with you, so you can look out three different sets of eyes-and somehow each face of the mask seems to color your view of the world through it. The mask depicts the three heads of a chimera-a savage dragon, a fierce lion, and a demonic goat. Totemists look to chimeras as a representation of multiplicity united. In a certain sense, they are the patrons of meldshaping itself-uniting disparate elements of beast souls and humanoid bodies to create powerful effects. At the simplest level, the threefold mask of the chimera grants you the ability to focus your attention in multiple directions simultaneously. You can't be flanked while this soulmeld is shaped. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in your threefold mask grants you a +1 competence bonus on Search and Spot checks.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Crown) Your threefold mask attaches to your forehead and now moves with your head as you turn. By focusing your concentration, you can tap into the mask's multiple perspectives to act more quickly, though at a cost. At the end of your turn, you can take one extra move action at no cost. If you choose to take this extra move action, you take a -5 penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class until the end of your next turn. Furthermore, on your next turn, you can take only a single standard action or a move action (but not both, and not a full-round action). Every point of essentia you invest in your threefold mask reduces by 1 the penalty applied on attack rolls and to Armor Class during the round following your extra move action. Thus, if you invest 1 point of essentia in your threefold mask and take an extra move action, your attack rolls and AC for the next round take only a -4 penalty (instead of -5). If you invest 5 or more points of essentia, you take no penalty on attack rolls and to AC made in the round following your extra move action (but are still restricted to taking only a single standard action or move action during that turn).	DESC:Chakra Bind (Soul) You experience a profound quickness of mind, almost as if three minds were thinking your thoughts and directing your actions, though this multiplicity of views can be confusing as well. This chakra bind functions as the crown chakra bind, except that instead of an extra move action, you can take an extra standard action at the end of your turn. However, on your next turn, you can take no actions. The same penalties as described above also apply in the following round, and they can be reduced by essentia investment as listed above.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Your threefold mask is no longer just a mask-your head branches into the three monstrous heads of a chimera. Three pairs of eyes look out on the world at once, three heads direct your actions, and three sets of savage jaws slaver for prey. You can use the heads of your threefold mask to make natural attacks. The dragon head bites for 1d8 points of damage, the lion head bites for 1d6 points of damage, and the goat head gores for 1d6 points of damage. As a standard action, you can attack with any one of these heads, applying your full Strength modifier as a bonus on your damage roll. As a full attack action, you can attack with all three heads, applying your full Strength modifier on all three damage rolls. Alternatively, as part of a full attack, you can make a secondary attack with one head at a -5 penalty, applying only one-half your Strength modifier as a bonus on your damage roll.

This corporeal shape fits over your clothing and armor, but it makes you seem like a hulking gray render in outline and features. Your actual body is only barely visible within the gray, hairless form. The render's broad shoulders and sinewy arms encompass yours and extend beyond them to translucent clawed hands scraping the ground. To some totemists, the greatest of the magical beasts are those that walk upright like humanoids but embody raw physical power-gray renders, owlbears, rampagers (described in Monster Manual II), blood apes (described in Monster Manual II), and the dreaded tarrasque. All of these creatures are totems of body strength, with the various abilities that come with physical might. By default, the avatar resembles a gray render in its outline and features, but it changes to resemble different magical beasts if you bind it to a chakra. The totem avatar grants you bonus hit points equal to your meldshaper level. These hit points don't go away first the way temporary hit points do; if this soulmeld is unshaped or suppressed, you lose the hit points granted by it. Essentia: You gain an enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus equal to the number of points of essentia you invest in your totem avatar.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Arms) Your totem avatar resembles an owlbear-no less hulking and stooped than the gray render form, but covered in a shaggy coat of feathers and fur. You gain the benefit of the Improved Grapple feat.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Feet) Your totem avatar resembles a rampager, with four elephantine legs, two muscular arms with hooked claws, a headless body with a gaping maw planted on the forward part of the torso, and a thick tail dragging behind. You gain stability as if you were a four-legged creature, giving you a +4 bonus on checks to resist a bull rush, overrun, or trip attack. You are also treated as if you were one size category larger than normal when making a check to resist a bull rush, grapple, overrun, or trip attack (effectively granting you an additional +4 on such checks).	DESC:Chakra Bind (Heart) Your totem avatar resembles the legendary tarrasque, though on a much smaller scale. Its hulking form leans forward of your own, its back covered with a thick, spiny carapace. Two mighty horns sprout from its head, and its jaw opens wide to reveal dozens of knifelike teeth. You gain damage reduction 5/magic. The amount of this damage reduction increases by 1 for every point of essentia you invest in the soulmeld.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Shoulders) Your totem avatar resembles a blood ape, taking on the appearance of a red-furred gorilla. Your natural weapons (whether from soulmelds or other sources) deal damage as if you were one size category larger.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) When you bind your totem avatar to your totem chakra, you become a little more like the gray render it represents. In particular, your body alters to better fill the musculature of the mighty beast avatar, lending you strength to smite your foes.

This corporeal shape fits over your clothing and armor, but it makes you seem like a hulking gray render in outline and features. Your actual body is only barely visible within the gray, hairless form. The render's broad shoulders and sinewy arms encompass yours and extend beyond them to translucent clawed hands scraping the ground. To some totemists, the greatest of the magical beasts are those that walk upright like humanoids but embody raw physical power-gray renders, owlbears, rampagers (described in Monster Manual II), blood apes (described in Monster Manual II), and the dreaded tarrasque. All of these creatures are totems of body strength, with the various abilities that come with physical might. By default, the avatar resembles a gray render in its outline and features, but it changes to resemble different magical beasts if you bind it to a chakra. The totem avatar grants you bonus hit points equal to your meldshaper level. These hit points don't go away first the way temporary hit points do; if this soulmeld is unshaped or suppressed, you lose the hit points granted by it.

A snarling muzzle filled with sharp teeth protrudes from the front of the mask, and eyes like blue ice crystals stare out in defiance. Evil tribes of arctic dwellers particularly revere the winter wolf. It is the embodiment of winter itself-deadly, fierce, cunning, and unrelenting in its assault on life and warmth. Totemists shape winter masks to claim the destructive power of winter as their own. Your touch takes on the bitter cold of winter; you can choose to inflict a chilling fatigue on an opponent you touch in combat. You must make a successful melee touch attack. The target is fatigued unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. Creatures resistant or immune to cold are immune to this effect. Essentia: Your touch attack also deals 1d4 points of nonlethal cold damage for every point of essentia you invest in your winter mask.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Throat) White fur spreads down from your winter mask to cover your throat. Your mouth is filled with a pleasant cold, like sucking a piece of ice on a hot day. You gain the ability to breathe a cone of cold. Once every 1d4 rounds, you can emit a 15-foot-long cone of cold. Targets in the cone take 2d6 points of cold damage plus 2d6 additional points of damage for every point of invested essentia (Reflex half).	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) Your face blends into that of your winter mask, merging with its lupine features. Your eyes appear in the mask's eye sockets, and they become the pale ice-blue of a winter wolf's eyes. Your jaws become the powerful maw of a winter wolf as well, and frost clings to the white fur around your muzzle as you breathe. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use this bite either as a primary attack (in which case it uses your full base attack bonus and adds your Strength bonus on damage rolls) or as a secondary attack (with a -5 penalty on the attack roll and applying only half your Strength bonus on your damage roll).

It strongly resembles the pelt of a worg, from the top of the beast's head perched atop your own to forelegs extending down your arms and rear legs hanging behind you. The fur is dark and thick, and glassy red eyes smolder in its face. Worgs are quintessential hunters-stalking predators, quick runners, and fierce combatants. Totemists who shape worg pelt soulmelds hope to emulate some or all of these qualities, and sometimes the worg's malicious evil as well. Your worg pelt grants you a +2 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Essentia: Every point of essentia that you invest in your worg pelt increases the competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks by 2.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Feet) The hind legs of your worg pelt fuse into your own legs, lengthening your feet and shins while shortening your thighs, enabling you to run on your toes like a predatory animal.

DESC:Chakra Bind (Hands) The forelegs of your worg pelt fuse into your own arms, adding weight and bulk to your hands. Your arms and hands are completely covered in the dark gray fur of a worg. When you hit with a bite attack-whether it is a bite attack you naturally possess, one granted by binding this soulmeld to your totem chakra, or one granted by another soulmeld, spell, or special effect-you can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip you.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) The head of your worg pelt becomes one with your own head. Your eyes begin to glow red and replace the glassy eyes of the pelt, while your lower jaw extends to join the upper muzzle of the pelt, granting you a fierce bite attack.

Though the belt does not serve as armor (and easily fits around any armor you might wear), it thickens your skin and tints it a faint purple color. The purple worm is one of the most feared magical beasts, particularly by those who live or adventure far beneath the surface of the earth. Many have despaired of ever penetrating its thick hide before dying in its gullet or being poisoned by the stinger at the tip of its tail. This soulmeld, particularly common among totemists in underground communities, is an attempt to emulate the awesome protection and the dangerous power of the purple worm. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your existing natural armor bonus. (If you do not have natural armor, you have an effective natural armor bonus of +0.) Essentia: The enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus increases by 1 for every point of essentia you invest in your wormtail belt.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Waist) Rather than forming a belt of purple scales at your waist, the soulmeld shapes plating on the skin of your torso and legs. Dark purple on the back and lighter in front, these scales seem to add to your bulk, and definitely increase your power in melee combat. You gain the Awesome Blow feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual) and are treated as one size category larger than usual when using it (up to a maximum of Colossal). The save DC to resist your awesome blow is calculated as normal for your soulmelds, rather than being based on the damage you deal.	DESC:Chakra Bind (Totem) A thick, purple-scaled tail emerges from the back of your wormtail belt. It is long enough that you can reach it around you to attack your foes with the stinger at its end, which drips with poison. You can use your wormtail belt's stinger to make natural attacks. You cannot use the stinger as a natural secondary weapon-using the stinger is the only attack you can make in a given round. You use your full base attack bonus for the attack roll, and the stinger deals 1d6 points of damage. In addition, the stinger delivers a weakening poison that deals initial damage of 1d4 Strength (no secondary damage). A successful Fortitude save negates the poison damage. Every point of essentia you invest in your wormtail belt gives you a +1 enhancement bonus on your attack rolls with the stinger, as well as increasing the poison's save DC as normal.

Drain Incarnum	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Least Invocation.2nd				DESC:This ephemeral claw reaches into a single creature within 30 feet. Unless the creature succeeds on a Fortitude save, it takes 1 point of essentia damage. A creature without an essentia pool instead takes 1 point of Wisdom damage.																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Incarnum Blast	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Greater Invocation.6th.Eldritch Essence	DESC:This eldritch essence invocation allows you to change your eldritch blast into an incarnum blast. Any living creature whose alignment is opposed to at least one component of yours must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. (For example, a chaotic good warlock would daze lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, and chaotic evil opponents.) If the creature also has an essentia pool, it also loses 1 point of essentia if it fails the save. Other living creatures take the normal damage for your eldritch blast but are not dazed. Nonliving creatures are entirely unaffected by incarnum blast. You can invest essentia in this invocation once per day as if it were an incarnum feat. Every point of essentia invested in your incarnum blast invocation increases the damage dealt by the blast by 1d6 points, but only against living creatures whose alignment is opposed to at least one component of yours. Once the amount of essentia invested is chosen, it cannot be altered and remains invested for 24 hours.	SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Incarnum Shroud	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Dark Invocation.8th					DESC:Your incarnum shroud grants you concealment (20%% miss chance) from all attackers, though you do not suffer any miss chance against others because of this invocation. You gain 1 point of essentia when this invocation is in effect. The duration of the invocation is 24 hours. You can invest essentia in this invocation once per day as if it were an incarnum feat. Every point of essentia invested in your incarnum shroud invocation grants you a +1 insight bonus to your Armor Class and on your Fortitude saving throws. Once the amount of essentia invested is chosen, it cannot be altered and remains invested for 24 hours. If your incarnum shroud is dispelled during this time, the essentia investment remains in place, taking effect once again when you activate the invocation.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Steal Incarnum	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Invocation.Lesser Invocation.4th				DESC:You can use this invocation to steal essentia from a touched opponent for your own use. Unless the creature succeeds on a Fortitude save, it loses 1 point of essentia for every 5 caster levels (to a maximum loss of 4 points at 20th level), and you gain essentia equal to the amount lost. The gained essentia fades after 1 minute, though the essentia loss must be healed or otherwise restored normally. If a creature fails its save against this invocation, it can't be affected by it again for 24 hours. A target without essentia can't be affected by this invocation.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.107

Furthermore, once per day as a standard action, you can transform your physical body into pure, luminous energy for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Upon assuming this form, you become incorporeal and gain a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability).

# Incarnum Blade
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Incarnum Blade ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Incarnum Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:You gain no new proficiencies with weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.122
Shape Blademeld				KEY:Incarnum Blade ~ Shape Blademeld				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnum Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 1st level, you gain the ability to create a special soulmeld called a blademeld by wrapping incarnum into a melee weapon of your choice. Doing so ties the chosen weapon more closely to your mind and soul and grants it special powers. A weapon with a blademeld shaped on it appears to have a blue glow and is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its hardness improves by 5, and its hit points increase by 5 per level you possess in incarnum blade. The weapon also gains a bonus on saving throws equal to your incarnum blade level. Shaping the blademeld requires 8 hours of rest followed by 1 hour of meditation, just like shaping any other soulmeld does. The blademeld remains shaped until you unshape it, though it unshapes automatically if the weapon to which it is attached is sundered or otherwise destroyed. Simply losing possession of the weapon does not unshape the blademeld, and it still retains its enhanced hardness, hit points, and save bonuses even if you are not holding it. The wielder benefits granted by the blademeld do not apply to anyone else who might pick it up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.122
Blademeld Chakra Bind			KEY:Incarnum Blade ~ Blademeld Chakra Bind			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnum Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:When you shape your blademeld, you can bind it to one of your body's chakras. Doing so grants you a special ability that lasts as long as the blademeld is shaped and the weapon is held. Unlike most soulmelds, the blademeld's appearance does not change while it is bound to a chakra, and the affected chakra is not apparent in any way to an onlooker. Furthermore, the weapon to which the blademeld is attached is still wielded normally, even if it is bound to a chakra other than your hands. You can be disarmed normally, and it can still be sundered in the usual way. If you lose or put down the weapon while it is bound, it remains bound and retains the special characteristics it gains from the blademeld; you also retain the special ability gained from the bind. No one else can benefit from the weapon's incarnum-based powers. Unlike a typical chakra bind, this one does not close the corresponding body slot. For example, a blademeld bound to your hands chakra does not prevent you from wearing a pair of magic gloves. Blademeld chakra bind does not grant you the ability to bind soulmelds or other magic items to your chakras. At 1st level, you can bind your blademeld to any of your least chakras (crown, feet, or hands); at 2nd level, you can bind it to any least or lesser chakra; and at 3rd level, you can bind it to any least, lesser, or greater chakra. At 4th level, you can bind your blademeld to your heart chakra, and at 5th level, you can bind it to your soul chakra. Binding your blademeld to a chakra grants you a special ability according to the chakra chosen, as detailed below. &nl;Crown Chakra: As long as this chakra bind is in effect, you have uncanny battlefield insight. Opponents that flank you do not gain the normal +2 bonus on attack rolls against you, though they still gain any other benefits they normally would, such as the ability to deliver a sneak attack. You also gain a +4 insight bonus on opposed attack rolls made to avoid being disarmed of the weapon with the blademeld or to avoid having it sundered. In addition, you gain a +4 insight bonus on Sense Motive checks made when someone attempts a feint against you in combat (see the Bluff skill description, page 68 of the Player's Handbook). &nl;Feet Chakra: You react more quickly than usual to danger, gaining a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks An incarnum blade, while this chakra bind is in effect. In addition, you can make attacks of opportunity with the blademeld weapon even while flat-footed. &nl;Hands Chakra: You can deal precise blows in combat. While the blademeld is bound to this chakra, you gain a +1 insight bonus on damage rolls made with the blademeld weapon. &nl;Arms Chakra: You can deal devastating strikes in combat. While it is in effect, this chakra bind grants you a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls made to confirm a critical threat with the blademeld weapon. &nl;Brow Chakra: You can more effectively battle foes that you can't see clearly while this chakra bind is in effect. Every time you miss an attack with the blademeld weapon because of the opponent's concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll once to see if you actually hit. This ability functions much like the Blind-Fight feat. If you already have Blind-Fight, you gain no additional benefit-that is, you are still entitled to only one reroll. &nl;Shoulders Chakra: You gain the ability to avoid certain particularly deadly strikes. Any time a melee attack would deal you a critical hit, you have a 25%% chance to negate the extra damage from it. This ability is active as long as this chakra bind is in effect. You need not be aware of the attack for the ability to function, but it grants no benefit if you are unconscious or otherwise helpless. This chakra bind has no effect against sneak attacks, and its benefit does not stack with that of the fortification armor or shield special quality. &nl;Throat Chakra: At will, you can brandish the weapon bearing the blademeld and utter a hearty battle shout that demoralizes foes. Each enemy within 60 feet who can hear you must save or become shaken for 1 round (Will DC 10 + incarnum blade level + Con modifier). You can use this ability at will as a standard action as long as the chakra bind is in effect. &nl;Waist Chakra: As long as this chakra bind is in effect, you are incredibly stable and well balanced when wielding your blademeld weapon. You gain a +10 insight bonus on checks made to avoid being bull rushed, grappled, tripped, or overrun. You also retain your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even while flat-footed. &nl;Heart Chakra: The weapon bearing the blademeld grants you improved health and well-being in combat as long as this chakra bind is in effect. You gain bonus hit points equal to twice your character level (maximum +40). These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are; if you change the chakra bind of your blademeld, you lose them immediately. &nl;Soul Chakra: Your blademeld weapon gains an alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. When you activate the chakra bind, you can choose any single alignment component (chaos, evil, good, or law) that matches one of your own. Thereafter, the choice cannot be changed until a new blademeld is shaped. Against creatures with an alignment subtype (not just an alignment) opposed to the selected component, your weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. If the blademeld weapon would ordinarily deal extra damage to the opponent because of the bane special quality or any of the alignment weapon qualities, the extra damage dice stack. For example, a lawful good incarnum blade who chooses this chakra bind could grant either the lawful or the good alignment to his blademeld weapon. If he chose good, his weapon would deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to all creatures with the evil subtype (such as demons and devils), but not to an evil necromancer who does not have the evil subtype.

Rebind Blademeld				KEY:Incarnum Blade ~ Rebind Blademeld				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Incarnum Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 3rd level, you gain the ability to change the chakra to which your blademeld is bound. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Constitution bonus (minimum 1/day). Rebinding your blademeld is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 5th level, you can change one or both of your blademeld's two chakra binds simultaneously as a standard action.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.123
Dual Chakra Binding			KEY:Incarnum Blade ~ Dual Chakra Binding				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Incarnum Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Upon attaining 5th level, you can bind your blademeld to two of your chakras simultaneously. The second chakra bind must be one that was gained at a lower incarnum blade level than the first. For example, if the first chakra bind is throat, the second cannot be waist; it must be lesser or least. You gain the special abilities from both chakra binds as though you were using each independently.

You do not, however, gain any other abilities of that class, such as new tiers of chakra binds. If you had more than one meldshaping class before becoming an ironsoul forgemaster, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining your essentia pool, meldshaper level, and the number of soulmelds and chakra binds available.

Shield Bond					KEY:Ironsoul Forgemaster ~ Shield Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ironsoul Forgemaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, you create a special bond with any shield that you craft. This bond allows you to invest essentia in the shield as if it were a soulmeld. Doing so grants you resistance 5 per point of invested essentia against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. You gain this ability only while using the shield for defense, not while carrying it on your back or in a container. If you stop using the shield, you lose the ability until you use it again, though you can reinvest the essentia in another soulmeld or ability on your next turn, as normal.

Secrets of the Forge			KEY:Ironsoul Forgemaster ~ Secrets of the Forge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ironsoul Forgemaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain Craft Magic Arms and Armor (see page 81 of the Player's Handbook) as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites. Your effective caster level for the purpose of crafting magic arms and armor is three times your ironsoul forgemaster level. For example, a 5th-level incarnate/2ndlevel ironsoul forgemaster is treated as a 6th-level caster for the purpose of creating magic arms and armor. These effective levels also stack with any other caster levels that might apply. You must still meet any other prerequisites for creating the desired item, such as other feats or the casting of specific spells. This stipulation might mean that you need the assistance of other characters to create a particular item.

Armor Bond					KEY:Ironsoul Forgemaster ~ Armor Bond				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ironsoul Forgemaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 5th level, you create a special bond with any suit of armor that you craft. This bond allows you to invest essentia in the armor as if it were a soulmeld. Doing so grants you damage reduction n/-, where n is equals the points of essentia invested. This damage reduction stacks with any damage reduction of the same kind granted by the armor. For example, if you invest 1 point of essentia into your self-crafted adamantine full plate armor, you would have DR 4/- (3 from the armor +1 from essentia). You gain this ability only while wearing the armor in the usual way. If you stop wearing it or if it is destroyed, you lose the ability until you put it on again, though you can reinvest the essentia in another soulmeld or ability on your next turn as normal.

You do not, however, gain any other abilities of that class, such as new tiers of chakra binds.

Consultation				KEY:Sapphire Hierarch ~ Consultation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Sapphire Hierarch Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 1st level, you can consult with the Sapphire Eidolon to gain advice about almost any subject. This consultation functions like a commune spell, except that you need not be able to cast the spell to use it. (In effect, you can use commune as a spell-like ability, but only while in the presence of the Sapphire Eidolon.) Contact with the creature's enormous intellect is draining, however, so you must pay the spell's XP cost as normal. You can consult with the Sapphire Eidolon only three times at each sapphire hierarch level from 1st to 9th. Any unused consultations for a given level are lost as soon as you attain a new one. Upon reaching 10th level, you can consult the Sapphire Eidolon once per month for the rest of your career.

You do not, however, gain any other abilities of that class, such as new tiers of chakra binds.

Arcane Investment				KEY:Soulcaster ~ Arcane Investment					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulcaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Beginning at 1st level, you can invest essentia in your arcane spells to make them more powerful. At the same time that you shape your soulmelds, you can choose to invest 1 point of essentia in any single spell that you know (and have prepared, if you prepare spells). At any time in the next 24 hours, you can choose to use that invested essentia when you cast the chosen spell. Doing so requires no action, but both the caster level of the spell and its save DC increase by 1. Once so used, the essentia returns to your essentia pool and can be invested into soulmelds or other effects. As you attain higher levels, the number of spells you can invest with essentia in this manner increases. You can affect a number of spells equal to your soulcaster level, and you cannot invest essentia in the same spell more than once-that is, you can't invest essentia in two lightning bolt spells, even if you can prepare or cast that spell more than once per day. This process is not the same as investing essentia in a spell as part of its casting (see page 52). If you use your arcane investment ability to affect a given spell, you can also invest essentia in it as part of its casting if the spell allows it, but the two essentia investments are separate. At 7th level, you can invest up to 2 points of essentia in each spell rather than only 1. A 2-point investment boosts the spell's caster level and save DC by 2 each for a single casting																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.143

By sacrificing one arcane spell slot (or one prepared arcane spell, if you prepare spells) of the highest level you can currently cast, you gain points of essentia equal to that spell's level for 1 round. This essentia can be invested or otherwise used as normal, but it disappears at the start of your next turn. This ability is usable once per round as a free action.

At your option, you can invest some or all of this extra essentia into your Cobalt Rage feat as a free action.

You must make this decision when you begin your rage, and you cannot shift any essentia away from Cobalt Rage while you are raging.

Upon reaching 10th level, you can use this ability once per year for the rest of your career.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.163
Dispelling Orb				KEY:Witchborn Binder ~ Dispelling Orb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Witchborn Binder Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 2nd level, you learn to shape a small orb of incarnum and hurl it at any target within 30 feet as a standard action. If you succeed on a ranged touch attack, the dispelling orb functions as a targeted dispel magic spell (caster level equals your meldshaper level). For every point of essentia you invest in the orb, you gain a +1 insight bonus on any dispel checks you make with it. After the attack is resolved, the invested essentia returns to your essentia pool and can be reinvested as normal.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.163
Essentia					KEY:Witchborn Binder ~ Essentia					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Witchborn Binder Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 2nd level and again at 6th level, you gain 1 extra point of essentia.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.163
Mage Shackles				KEY:Witchborn Binder ~ Mage Shackles				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Witchborn Binder Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:Beginning at 4th level, as a standard action you can shape a set of shackles from incarnum. With a successful melee touch attack, you can use these shackles to bind a creature capable of arcane spellcasting or using spell-like abilities, as long as it is within one size category of you. You must overcome any spell resistance the target creature might have with a successful caster level check, using your meldshaper level as your caster level, or the attack fails. Once so bound, the target creature is considered entangled by the mage shackles and is also effectively barred from planar movement, as if affected by a dimensional anchor spell. In addition, the affected creature must succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + your meldshaper level + essentia invested in the mage shackles) to cast an arcane spell or use any spell-like ability. The mage shackles cannot be damaged or broken except by an effect that unshapes a soulmeld, but a bound creature can escape from them as if they were masterwork manacles (Escape Artist DC 35). A creature incapable of casting arcane spells or using spell-like abilities is unaffected by the mage shackles. You can use this ability as often as you desire, though you can have only one set of mage shackles shaped at any time, since shaping a second set causes the first to disappear. After 24 hours, your mage shackles automatically unshape unless you remain within 1 mile of the shackled creature. Otherwise, they remain shaped until you choose to unshape them (a free action). No one except you can use the mage shackles you shape-they simply refuse to function at anyone else's command.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.163
Word of Abrogation			KEY:Witchborn Binder ~ Word of Abrogation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Witchborn Binder Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:Beginning at 6th level, you can use your command of incarnum to counterspell your enemies. To do so, you must first ready an action. If any creature within 60 feet of you casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, you can attempt to negate the effect as an immediate action with a caster level check (DC 11 + the enemy creature's caster level), using your meldshaper level as your caster level. You gain a +1 bonus on the check for every point of essentia you invest in this ability. You can abrogate only one spell or spell-like effect with each use of this ability, so if you are facing multiple spellcasters, you must decide which one to target with your word of abrogation and wait until your chosen target takes its turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.164
Spiritflay					KEY:Witchborn Binder ~ Spiritflay					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Witchborn Binder Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:Beginning at 8th level, you can catch a tiny bit of an arcane spellcaster's soulstuff between your hands and mangle it. You can use this attack against any arcane spellcaster or creature with spell-like abilities that is within 60 feet of you. The target creature must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your witchborn binder level + your Con modifier) or take 1d8 points of damage per point of essentia you invest in the ability, and also be nauseated for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the nausea. A creature that has no arcane spells prepared, no arcane spell slots unused, and no spell-like abilities available is immune to this attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.164
Grim Integument				KEY:Witchborn Binder ~ Grim Integument				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Witchborn Binder Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 10th level, you can shape a coffinlike shroud of incarnum around a foe up to 30 feet away as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Your foe can attempt a Ref lex save (DC 10 + invested essentia + your Con modifier) to escape the grim integument before it forms around him. If the target creature has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check to overcome it, using your meldshaper level as your caster level. A successful saving throw renders the target immune to your grim integument for 24 hours. Once the grim integument forms, the subject is rooted to the spot and unable to move, with its arms bound to its sides. It can still speak and use spell-like abilities, psionics, or spells requiring only verbal components, but each time it attempts to use an arcane spell or spell-like ability, it takes 1d6 points of damage per point of essentia invested in the grim integument. A successful Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + invested essentia + Con modifier) halves this damage. Any damage the creature takes from this effect has the normal chance to disrupt its spell or spell-like ability. Because the grim integument is opaque, it provides total cover and total concealment for the creature inside, but also prevents any one from seeing in or out. The grim integument provides an unlimited supply of breathable air to its victim. Unlike most creations of incarnum, the grim integument can be physically damaged. The creature inside can burst it open with a successful Strength check (DC 20 + invested essentia), or it can be destroyed by damage in the same way as any object. For every point of essentia invested in this ability, the grim integument has hardness 10 and 20 hit points. Furthermore, any effect that unshapes a soulmeld destroys a grim integument. If it is destroyed or unshaped by another, any essentia invested in it is lost for 24 hours, and you become fatigued. Otherwise, the grim integument persists for as long as you remain within 30 feet of the subject. You can voluntarily unshape the grim integument as a fullround action. If you do so, or if the creature inside escapes without destroying the grim integument, the incarnum shroud fades away into nothingness, but you suffer no loss of essentia or fatigue. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum once per day).

SOURCEPAGE:p.172
Dissolution					KEY:Dissolution Ooze ~ Dissolution		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Dissolution Ooze Race Trait.SpecialQuality					DESC:Any melee hit by a dissolution ooze against a creature with at least one soulmeld shaped requires the target to attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save. Failure indicates that one of the target's soulmelds (determined randomly) spontaneously unshapes. If the dissolution ooze successfully unshapes a soulmeld, it immediately consumes the freed soul energy, gaining a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times the points of essentia invested in the soulmeld (minimum 5 hp). The target loses all benefits of the meld until it is shaped again. A successful save negates this effect. The target gains a +4 bonus on the saving throw if the soulmeld is bound to a chakra. The save DC is Constitution-based.																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.172

In addition to soulmelds, this ability detects any creature with the incarnum subtype, as well as objects invested with essentia. The dissolution ooze can't differentiate between targets upon which it can "feed" (namely soulmelds) and other incarnum-laced targets. However, if it fails to unshape a soulmeld with its first hit, it moves on to a different target, if one is available.

Breath Weapon				KEY:Incarnum Dragon ~ Breath Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Incarnum Dragon Race Trait.SpecialQuality						DESC:An incarnum dragon's breath weapon is a cone of resonating energy that separates incarnum from living matter and deals damage to creatures (but not to objects). Every creature within the area must make a Reflex save or be temporarily drained of essentia. This effect reduces the essentia pool of each target by a number of points equal to the dragon's age category for 1 hour. A successful Fortitude save halves both the damage dealt and the essentia drained. The save DC is Constitution-based.																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.173
Meldshaping Ability			KEY:Incarnum Dragon ~ Meldshaping Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Incarnum Dragon Race Trait.SpecialQuality								DESC:An incarnum dragon has the innate ability to shape soulmelds chosen from the soulborn class list.

SOURCEPAGE:p.173
Consume Soulmeld				KEY:Incarnum Dragon ~ Consume Soulmeld	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Incarnum Dragon Race Trait.SpecialQuality						DESC:With a successful bite attack, an ancient or older incarnum dragon can consume a single soulmeld shaped on the target creature. In addition to dealing normal damage, this attack requires the creature to make a Fortitude save at the same DC as the dragon's breath weapon. Failure indicates that one of the target's soulmelds (determined randomly) spontaneously unshapes. The dragon then consumes the soul energy from the meld, gaining a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times the points of essentia invested in the meld (minimum 5 hp). The target loses all benefits of the meld until it is shaped again. Once it has consumed a soulmeld, the incarnum dragon cannot use this ability again for 24 hours.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.173

Adaptive Attack				KEY:Incarnum Golem ~ Adaptive Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Incarnum Golem Race Trait.SpecialQuality						DESC:When it strikes, an incarnum golem adapts its attack to take advantage of weaknesses in the opponent's defenses. Each round that it successfully damages a living creature, it gains a cumulative +1 insight bonus (maximum +5) on attack rolls and damage rolls against that opponent. This bonus remains in force until the golem deals damage to a different living creature. For example, the first time an incarnum golem damages a living foe, a +1 bonus applies to each of its attacks against that target in subsequent rounds. The next time it hits that foe, the bonus increases to +2. During any round that it misses the target, the bonus does not increase. If the incarnum golem hits a different target at any point in that progression, the bonus against the first target is lost, and a new bonus begins to accrue against the new target.

Its body remains intact and inanimate, but its spirit is torn free from its corpse and transformed. Such spawn are under the command of the incarnum wraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. A humanoid that does not have an essentia pool is merely dead if slain by an incarnum wraith.

Essentia Drain				KEY:Incarnum Wraith ~ Essentia Drain	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Incarnum Wraith Race Trait.SpecialQuality						DESC:Any living creature hit by an incarnum wraith's incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or lose 1d4 points of essentia. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the creature struck does not have essentia, or its essentia pool is already depleted, it takes Constitution damage equal to the points of essentia that would normally be lost.

From each soul captured in this manner, it gains +10 hp and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and saving throws. These bonuses fade after a period of 10 minutes per character level of the creature that died. At the end of this period, the soul has been entirely consumed. A creature whose soul has been trapped by a souleater cannot be raised from the dead until the souleater is slain.

Soulless Aura				KEY:Souleater ~ Soulless Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Souleater Race Trait.SpecialQuality							DESC:A souleater emanates a misty aura of negative energy, which drains away the essence of nearby souls. Each living creature within 30 feet of a souleater gains a negative level, which persists as long as the souleater remains within that range. This negative level never results in actual level loss. A soul eater does not gain extra hit points from the negative levels that this aura bestows on other creatures, but it does gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls as long as at least one living creature (other than another souleater) is within this aura. The soulless aura also makes the manipulation of incarnum more difficult. Any character within 30 feet of a souleater who attempts to shape a soulmeld, bind a soulmeld or magic item to a chakra, or invest or reallocate essentia must succeed on a DC 20 Concentration check to do so.

Every creature within 30 feet who can hear it is fascinated for as long as the song continues, plus 1 round thereafter (Will negates). The mere sight of the lost does not allow a new saving throw, but any attack made against an affected character-even if the attack comes from the lost itself-automatically ends the effect. Song of misery is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. All lost are immune to the emotion-based special attacks of other lost, even if they don't share the same emotion.

A magical attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a soulfused flesh golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals electricity damage breaks any slow effect on a soulfused flesh golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem's hit points to exceed their normal maximum, the creature gains any excess as temporary hit points. For example, a soulfused flesh golem hit by a lightning bolt heals 3 points of damage if the attack would normally have dealt 11 points of damage. A soulfused flesh golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.													SOURCEPAGE:p.196
