Pearl of Incarnum Power							TYPE:Incarnum																								SOURCEPAGE:p.147												SPROP:Certain relics particularly suited for a soulcaster's skills have been passed down from mentors to novitiates for centuries. Among these are pearls of incarnum power, which look like typical pearls except for a slightly cloudy sheen on their surfaces. Like a pearl of power, a pearl of incarnum power enables the possessor to recall any one spell that he has already prepared and then cast. In addition, however, he can restore any essentia that was previously invested in that spell as part of the same action used to recall it. The spell is then prepared again, with its invested essentia, just as if it had not been cast. Each pearl of incarnum power functions once per day, and only for spells of a particular level. Strong transmutation; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be able to cast spells of the spell level to be recalled, creator must have an essentia pool; Price 1,500 gp (1st), 6,000 gp (2nd), 13,500 gp (3rd), 24,000 gp (4th), 37,500 gp (5th), 54,000 gp (6th), 73,500 gp (7th), 96,000 gp (8th), 121,500 gp (9th).

Ring of Essentia					TYPE:Ring.Magic				COST:16000	WT:0		MODS:NO			SOURCELONG:Magic of Incarnum	SOURCESHORT:MoI		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:Effect: Any character with an essentia pool can touch the ring of essentia to bestow 1 point of essentia from his essentia pool into the ring. This reduces the size of his essentia pool by 1. The wearer of the ring can use this essentia as if it were part of his own essentia pool (even if he doesn't have essentia of his own). The ring can hold no more than 1 point of essentia. The essentia stored within the ring remains for 24 hours before it dissipates, returning to the character who placed it there. Before that time, it can be released in one of two ways. The wearer of the ring can release the essentia from the gemstone as a standard action, in which case it immediately returns to the essentia pool of its original owner. Alternatively, if the character who bestowed the essentia touches the ring, he can reclaim his essentia as a standard action. Aura and Caster Level: Faint necromancy; CL 5th.

In addition, it serves as a receptacle for the wearer's essentia, much like a soulmeld. Every point of essentia invested in the ring increases its deflection bonus to AC by 1. A ring of soulbound protection has an essentia capacity. Lesser rings of soulbound protection have a maximum essentia capacity of 2. The maximum value of essentia that can be invested in the ring is equal to this capacity or the character's normal essentia capacity (see Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity), whichever is less. Aura and Caster Level: Moderate abjuration; CL 6th.
Ring of Soulbound Protection (Greater)	TYPE:Ring.Magic				COST:26000	WT:0		MODS:NO			SOURCELONG:Magic of Incarnum	SOURCESHORT:MoI		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:Effect: A ring of soulbound protection grants a +1 deflection bonus to the wearer's Armor Class. In addition, it serves as a receptacle for the wearer's essentia, much like a soulmeld. Every point of essentia invested in the ring increases its deflection bonus to AC by 1. A ring of soulbound protection has an essentia capacity. Greater rings of soulbound protection have a maximum essentia capacity of 4. The maximum value of essentia that can be invested in the ring is equal to this capacity or the character's normal essentia capacity (see Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity), whichever is less. Aura and Caster Level: Strong abjuration; CL 18th.
Amulet of Incarnum Shielding			TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Amulet	COST:2100	WT:1		MODS:NO			SOURCELONG:Magic of Incarnum	SOURCESHORT:MoI		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:Effect: The wearer of an amulet of incarnum shielding is immune to any effect that would drain his incarnum or unshape a soulmeld.

In addition, it serves as a receptacle for the wearer's essentia, much like a soulmeld. Every point of essentia invested in the cloak increases its resistance bonus by 1. A cloak of soulbound resistance has an essentia capacity. Lesser cloaks of soulbound resistance have a maximum essentia capacity of 2. The maximum value of essentia that can be invested in the cloak is equal to this capacity or the character's normal essentia capacity (see Table 2-1: Essentia Capacity), whichever is less. Chakra Bind (Shoulders): A cloak of soulbound resistance grants extra power if you bind it to your shoulders chakra. The resistance bonus granted by the cloak is improved by 1, up to a maximum of +4.

Glove of Incarnum Theft				TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Glove	COST:8000	WT:1		MODS:NO			SOURCELONG:Magic of Incarnum	SOURCESHORT:MoI		SOURCEPAGE:p.114	SPROP:Effect: By making a successful unarmed touch attack with the hand wearing the glove, the wearer gains 1 point of essentia while the target loses 1 point from his essentia pool. A DC 15 Will save negates this effect. (If the target has no essentia pool, there is no effect.) The stolen essentia can immediately be invested in any soulmeld, incarnum feat, or other essentia receptacle of the wearer (with no action required), even if essentia investment wouldn't normally be allowed at this time. If the wearer has no means of using essentia, he gains no benefit, but the target still loses the point. The stolen essentia remains in the wearer's essentia pool for 1 minute, and then it returns to the original owner. Chakra Bind (Hands): A glove of incarnum theft grants extra power if you bind it to your hands chakra. The save DC to resist the glove's effect increases by 2. Aura and Caster Level: Moderate necromancy; CL 7th.
