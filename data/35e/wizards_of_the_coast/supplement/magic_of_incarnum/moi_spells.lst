As a free action, you can mentally direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The midnight construct acts normally on the last round of the spell's duration and dissipates at the end of its turn. Midnight constructs are not summoned; they are created on the plane you inhabit, using incarnum you coalesce. Thus, they are not subject to effects that hedge out or otherwise affect outsiders or summoned creatures. Essentia: You can invest essentia in a midnight construct when you create it to gain one or more of the following modifications to the construct. Every point of essentia can be invested in any one modification. . Combat Power: +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls per point of essentia invested. .

This doesn't prevent the target from reinvesting essentia normally on his next turn, but it might make him vulnerable in the meantime.

Instantly, an arc of soul energy forms between you and the incarnum rod, creating a line. At the end of your turn, any living creature in that line takes 1d6 points of damage (Reflex negates). In subsequent rounds, incarnum arcs again between you and the rod at the end of your turn. You can move the rod up to 20 feet by an act of will as a move action, or you can leave it in place and move yourself if you wish to change the path of the arc. If the distance between you and the rod at the end of your turn is beyond the spell's range, no arc occurs but the spell remains active. Essentia: Every point of essentia invested in this spell increases the damage dealt by 1d6 points (2d6 points for 1 point of essentia, 3d6 points for 2 points of essentia, and so on).

He gains fast healing 1. In addition, any spell he casts that heals hit point damage heals an additional amount to each creature affected by that spell equal to your caster level or twice the healing spell's level, whichever is lower. For example, a cleric casting mass cure serious wounds would add either +14 (twice the level of the mass cure serious wounds spell) or the incarnum vigor's caster level, whichever is lower, to the healing provided to each target of the spell. Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in this spell increases the fast healing granted by 1 point.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Incarnum Weapon										CLASSES:Cleric=5								DOMAINS:Incarnum=5		SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Incarnum		COMPS:V, S (E)		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:Large weapon of incarnum							DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds (D)				SAVEINFO:Will partial						SPELLRES:No				SOURCELONG:Magic of Incarnum	SOURCESHORT:MoI		SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:Weapon shaped of incarnum attacks foe.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:An oversized weapon made of pure incarnum springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 2d6 points of damage per hit. In addition, any living creature struck by the incarnum weapon takes 1 point of Wisdom drain (a successful Will save negates the Wisdom drain). The weapon takes a form based on your alignment: battleaxe (chaotic), flail (evil), warhammer (good), or longsword (law). Casters can choose any weapon whose alignment is not opposed to theirs (neutral casters can choose any of the four weapons). Regardless of the weapon's form, it threatens a critical only on a 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. The incarnum weapon strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon; for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. An incarnum weapon cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but it can be affected by any effect that would affect a spell or a soulmeld. An incarnum weapon's Armor Class against touch attacks is 11 (10 + size bonus for Small object). Essentia: Every point of essentia you invest in the incarnum weapon adds a +1 insight bonus on the weapon's attack rolls and damage rolls and expands the weapon's critical threat range by 1. For example, an incarnum weapon spell with 2 points of essentia invested would have a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and would have a critical threat range of 18-20.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

(The spell has no effect on chakras to which soulmelds or magic items are already bound; in other words, it does not allow you to double bind to a chakra.) You can open a creature's crown, feet, or hands chakra with this spell. A creature benefiting from this spell can bind a soulmeld or magic item to his opened chakra just as if he had gained the ability to form a chakra bind from a feat or class feature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

The spell forms a barrier at a distance of 1 foot around the warded creature. The barrier is normally invisible, but it flashes electric blue when struck by an incarnum creature's natural weapon attack or an effect generated by a soulmeld. While protected, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both of these bonuses apply only against natural weapon attacks made by incarnum creatures or effects created by soulmelds. A side effect of this spell is that it prevents the subject from gaining essentia, even if such an effect would be considered beneficial. Such effects automatically fail if targeted on the protected subject.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

If the target has an essentia pool, he instead loses essentia equal to the Charisma damage that would be dealt (if the damage is larger than the target's essentia pool, any leftover points of damage are dealt as Charisma damage). This spell can't reduce a target's Charisma below 1. You gain 1 point of temporary essentia for every point of essentia or Charisma damage you deal to the subject. This temporary essentia remains in your pool for 1 minute, after which it dissipates. While you have it, you can use your temporary essentia just like normal essentia.

All soulmelds are suppressed within the soulbanned zone. Essentia cannot be invested or reallocated by any creature within the area; currently invested essentia has no effect inside the zone. Incarnum creatures are not otherwise affected by the soulbanned zone (they can enter normally). Only creatures entirely within the soulbanned zone are affected. Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the soulbanned zone (or only partially within it), it can use its essentia incarnum-based abilities normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Each time you hit a living creature with a weapon affected by soulbleed wounding, that creature loses 1 point of essentia unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. You don't gain the essentia; it is simply lost. Spell resistance applies against this effect. If any round of the spell's duration goes by in which no living creature is affected by the spell (either because you didn't hit a living creature or because no saving throw was failed), you take 1d6 points of damage from the spell. No save or spell resistance is allowed to resist this effect. This spell works only as long as you wield the weapon affected. Any other wielder gains no benefit from the effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

This is identical to the effect of a dispel magic spell targeted on an object, except for duration and your ability to invest essentia to improve your caster level check. This spell has no effect on ongoing spell effects, even if those effects are on items (such as greater magic weapon).

If the unshaped soulmeld was bound to one of the target's chakras, the target takes damage equal to 3d6 points plus 1 additional point per caster level (maximum 3d6+15).

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object, but it can be adjacent to such. It must always be a flat plane, although you can shape its edges to fit the available space. The wall of incarnum must be anchored to a surface, but this can be a floor, a ceiling, or even a wall. The wall of incarnum can't be moved once it is created. A wall of incarnum is 1 inch thick. It can be dispelled, but it cannot be damaged or broken, and spells cannot pass through it. Ethereal creatures can pass through it, but any other creature (including the caster) attempting to pass through a wall must succeed on a Will save or be blocked by the barrier.

TARGETAREA:One soul-imbued crystal shard	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) hours or until discharged	SAVEINFO:None				SPELLRES:No			SOURCELONG:Magic of Incarnum	SOURCESHORT:MoI		SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:You call into being a shard of psionic crystal and entice the soul of a powerful psion not yet born to enter the shard. You then imbue the soul crystal with a single power you know and can manifest, and a number of power points you expend from your power reserve (in addition to the points necessary to manifest soul crystal in the first place). You can choose to bestow a number of power points up to twice your manifester level. Any creature you give the created soul crystal to can then manifest the imbued power, using the power point reserve you bestowed in the crystal. The wielder's manifester level is equal to your own manifester level when you create the crystal, so the wielder can choose to augment the power you implanted in the crystal (if manifester level and the soul crystal's remaining power point reserve permit) or possibly use the power multiple times. The imbued power can be manifested only by spending power points from the reserve you initially created when you made the soul crystal, so if you give the crystal to another manifester, that character can't use her own power points to manifest the power in the soul crystal. Manifesting a power from the soul crystal is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The person using the soul crystal makes all decisions about targeting the imbued power, just as if she were a psion manifesting the power herself. The soul crystal persists until the duration of the power lapses or there are no longer sufficient power points remaining in the crystal's reserve to manifest the imbued power one time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
