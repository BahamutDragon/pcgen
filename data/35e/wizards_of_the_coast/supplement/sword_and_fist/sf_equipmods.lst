# Shields
# Modifier Name	Unique Key			Type		Plus		Visible		Type granted	Source Page		Multiple Requirements										Required Type			Special Property																																																																																																																																																																																	Apply to both heads
Arrow Catching	KEY:ARROW_CATCH_SHLD	TYPE:Shield	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	ITYPE:Enhancement	SOURCEPAGE:p.75														PRETYPE:2,Shield,Magic		SPROP:A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 versus ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer instead. (If the wielder has total cover with respect to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's increased AC bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder activates this ability with a command word and can shut it off by repeating the command word.
Dancing		KEY:DANCING_WEAP		TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:3	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	ITYPE:Enhancement	SOURCEPAGE:p.76														PRETYPE:2,Weapon,Magic		SPROP:The wearer can loose a dancing shield as a standard action and command it to protect a single character (possibly the wearer himself). The dancing shield floats in the air in front of the protected character, darting in front of an opponent's weapons and providing with respect to the attacker, the projectile or thrown cover against attacks from one opponent per round. (It provides cover against an attacker unless it has already done so since its wielder's last turn.) Use the shield's armor bonus (including its enhancement bonus) as the cover bonus to AC. At the end of 4 rounds, the dancing shield falls to the ground. The user must pick it up and command it for it to function again. Only one dancing shield can protect a character. It is half as effective as normal (half the cover bonus to AC) when protecting a Large-size creature, and it cannot effectively provide cover for a Huge or bigger creature. The dancing shield only functions for a character that is proficient with using shields. It ceases dancing before 4 rounds have passed if so commanded.	ASSIGNTOALL:NO
# Weapons
Ki Focus		KEY:KI_FOCUS_WEAP		TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	ITYPE:Enhancement	SOURCEPAGE:p.76														PRETYPE:3,Weapon,Magic,Melee	SPROP:The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder's fact, allowing her to use her special ki attacks through the weapon as if it were an unarmed attack. These attacks include the monk's stunning attack, strike, and quivering palm, as well as the Stunning Fist feat. Only melee weapons can have ki focus.																																																																																																																															ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Merciful		KEY:MERCIFUL_WEAP		TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	ITYPE:Enhancement	SOURCEPAGE:p.76														PRETYPE:3,Weapon,Magic,Ranged	SPROP:The weapon deals +ld6 points of damage, and all damage it deals is subdual damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until commanded to resume it. Bows, crossbows, and slings so enchanted bestow the merciful effect upon their ammunition.																																																																																																																																									ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Seeking		KEY:SEEKING_WEAP		TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	ITYPE:Enhancement	SOURCEPAGE:p.76														PRETYPE:3,Weapon,Magic,Ranged	SPROP:Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers toward the target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right place. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)																																																																																																																								ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Sure Striking	KEY:SURE_STRIKE_WEAP	TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	ITYPE:Enhancement	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	PREMULT:2,[PRETYPE:3,Weapon,Magic,Ranged],[!PRETYPE:1,Bow,Crossbow,Sling]						SPROP:A sure striking weapon harms creatures with damage reduction as if it had a +5 enhancement bonus. Bows, crossbows, and slings cannot have the sure striking ability.																																																																																																																																																							ASSIGNTOALL:NO
Vicious		KEY:VICIOUS_WEAP		TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	ITYPE:Enhancement	SOURCEPAGE:p.76														PRETYPE:3,Weapon,Magic,Melee	SPROP:When a vicious weapon strikes an opponent, it creates a flash of disruptive energy that resonates between the opponent and the wielder. This energy deals +2d6 points of damage to the opponent and ld6 points of damage to the wielder. Only melee weapons can be vicious.																																																																																																																																						ASSIGNTOALL:NO
