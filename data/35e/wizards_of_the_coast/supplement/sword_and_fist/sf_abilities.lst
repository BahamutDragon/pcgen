Whip Sneak Attack				KEY:Lasher ~ Whip Sneak Attack								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LasherClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality								DEFINE:SneakAttackDice|0				DESC:%1d6|SneakAttackDice	DESC:If a lasher catches an opponent unable to defend himself effectively from her attack anywhere within range (up to 15 ft.), she can use a whip or whip dagger to strike a vital spot for extra damage (a lasher does not gain a sneak attack with other weapons). Any time the lasher's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the lasher flanks the target, the lasher's attack deals +ld6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by a+ld6 points every fourth level (+2d6 at 5th level, and +3d6 at 9th level). Should the lasher score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. This ability stacks with any other sneak attack ability. With a regular whip (but not a whip dagger), the lasher can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage (see Wound below). A lasher can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the lasher must also be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The lasher cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

This allows the lasher to inflict damage on creatures with an armor bonus of+1 or better or a natural armor bonus of +3 or better. If using the whip to deal subdual damage, it deals no damage to creatures with a +1 or more armor bonus or +3 or more natural armor (as usual), lashers using a whip dagger always deal regular damage to opponents.

Third Hand					KEY:Lasher ~ Third Hand										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LasherClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 2nd level, a lasher's precision with the whip or whip dagger allows her to use it almost like a third hand-a third hand at the end of a flexible 15-foot-long arm-as a standard action. Depositing a lashed object into your hand is a moveequivalent action. Note; A lasher generally uses a normal whip to perform abilities granted by third hand, because a whip dagger deals its damage to the object or individual grasped, while a regular whip does not. Sometimes, this is not a problem, especially if the item grasped has hardness, but other times inflicting damage by using third hand is a bad idea. Thus, most lashers carry two whips. A lasher successfully performs a task if her attack roll equals or exceeds the DC for a given task: Punch a button, snuff a candle flame, flick a coin lying along the ground, etc. as a move-equivalent action. Range 15 feet, DC 15. Retrieve an unattended object of up to 20 pounds, and deposit into your offhand as a move-equivalent action. Range 15 feet, DC 20. Firmly wrap the end of your whip around a pole, spike, or other likely projection up to 15 feet away as a move-equivalent action. The DC is 22. If used to wrap around a projection at the top of a wall, reduce the DC to climb the wall by 5. If the point of attachment is optimal on a ceiling fixture, you could swing over a chasm of up to 25 feet wide. You can also wrap items heavier than 20 pounds, but you cannot automatically flick them into your off hand (but you could drag them). You can unwrap the end of your whip from the entangled object as a free action.  When the victim of a precipitous fall, you can give up your Reflex save in an attempt to use your whip to snag a likely projection, pillar, rafter, etc., within 15 feet of the edge of the pit, cliff, bridge, etc. Generally, an unattached item (such as a statue, table, etc.) must weigh twice as much as you for you to arrest your fall, otherwise you merely pull it after you. You may attempt to snag a friend or foe standing near the edge of the precipice as you fall. You make a ranged touch attack against another creature's AC (the friend does not apply his Dexterity bonus while an unwilling friend or a foe applies their Dexterity modifier to AC), If you hit, you wrap your whip around the target, who must make a successful Strength check against DC 20 to arrest both you and himself. An unsuccessful Strength check sends both you and your target into the precipice. You can unwrap the end of our whip from the entangled object as a free action.																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.26

Stunning Snap				KEY:Lasher ~ Stunning Snap									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:LasherClassAbility.ClassAbility.SpecialQuality																DESC:A lasher can use a whip or whip dagger to stun a creature instead of inflicting subdual or normal damage. The lasher can use this ability once per round, but no more than once per level per day. The lasher must declare she is using a stun attack before making an attack roll. (A missed attack roll ruins the attempt.) A foe struck by a whip or whip dagger must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the lasher's level + Strength modifier), in addition to receiving normal damage (subdual or standard). If the saving throw fails, the opponent is stunned for one round. A stunned character cannot act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, while attackers get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a stunned opponent. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned by the lasher's stunning attack.

Opponents who fail are stunned for ld4+l rounds. Stunned opponents must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 18) or become helpless for ld4-1 rounds (minimum I round).
