Tripple Dagger							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tripple Dagger		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Piercing.Metal.Dagger.MeleePiercing									COST:10	WT:1				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d4				WIELD:Light		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:This weapon is used in the offhand as a means to disarm an opponent-you hold it as you would a shield, not another weapon, and so do not suffer penalties for fighting with two weapons. When using a triple dagger, you get a +3 bonus on you opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if you fail to disarm your opponent). The triple dagger could also be used as a normal dagger desired, but if used in the off-hand, all normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.

A Small-size character uses a gnome battlepick two-handed as a martial weapon.
Bladed Gauntlet							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Bladed Gauntlet		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Slashing.Metal.Gauntlet.MeleeSlashing									COST:30	WT:4		SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:4	DAMAGE:1d6				WIELD:Light		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:Unlike a standard gauntlet, an attack with a bladed gauntlet is not considered an unarmed attack. The bladed gauntlet possesses two cruelly sharpened blades that extend from the back of the wrist following the line of the forearm. The cost and weight are for a single gauntlet.
War Fan								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|War Fan			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Slashing.Metal.Fan.MeleeSlashing										COST:30	WT:3				CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6				WIELD:Light		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:This weapon appears to the untrained eye a nothing more than a beautifully crafted lady's fan. In fact the vanes of the fan are crafted from steel, and the tips are needle-sharp. When first brought into melee, the wielder may attempt a Bluff check against an opponent's Sense Motive check. If the wielder wins the contest, he adds +4 bonus to the attack roll for his first round's attack(s).
# Medium
Chain-and-Dagger							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Chain-and-Dagger		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Piercing.Metal.Chain.Dagger.MeleePiercing								COST:4	WT:4				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d4				WIELD:OneHanded	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:You get a +2 bonus on your opposed attack when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed yourself, if you fail to disarm your opponent). You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks, gaining a +2 bonus on your trip attempt. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can opt to drop the chain- and-dagger instead of being tripped.
Longsword, Mercurial	KEY:Longsword (Mercurial)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Longsword (Mercurial)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Slashing.Standard.Metal.Sword.MeleeSlashing								COST:400	WT:6				CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8				WIELD:OneHanded	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT|-2|!PREWEAPONPROF:1,Longsword (Mercurial)					SPROP:As above, except that in nonproficient hands, the shifting mass and feel of the blade penalizes the wielder by an additional -2 penalty to attack rolls, beyond the normal nonproficiency penalty for using an exotic weapon untrained.
# Large
Duom									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Duom				TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Piercing.Wood.Spear.MeleePiercing										COST:20	WT:8				CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8				WIELD:TwoHanded	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:The duom is a longspear with a standard spear-head, as well as two blades curved so that they point backward along the shaft. The weapon has reach, allowing you to strike opponents 10 feet away with it. Those proficient with the spear can also use it to attack adjacent foes with the reversed heads with a practiced "reverse thrust." Apply a +2 bonus to the attack roll for the first attack made by the duom against an adjacent opponent.
Gyrspike								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Gyrspike			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Double.Slashing.Metal.Sword.MeleeSlashing		ALTTYPE:Melee.Bludgeoning.Flail	COST:90	WT:20				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d8	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	WIELD:TwoHanded	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:A gyrspike is a double weapon. A stout shaft holds a flail on one end and a longsword on the other. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties for two-weapon fighting, as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You get a+2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an enemy when you wield a gyrspike (including the opposed attack roll to avoid being disarmed yourself if you fail to disarm your enemy). You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks, if you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gyrspike to avoid being tripped.
Manti									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Manti			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Piercing.Wood.Spear.MeleePiercing										COST:15	WT:9				CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8				WIELD:TwoHanded	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:A manti is a shortspear with four additional spear heads that project vertically from the shaft, creating a star pattern of five blade heads instead of just a single forward-pointing blade. The advantage for someone trained to use the manti is that you make one additional attack of opportunity during the round.
Greatsword, Mercurial	KEY:Greatsword (Mercurial)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatsword (Mercurial)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Slashing.Standard.Metal.Sword.MeleeSlashing								COST:600	WT:17				CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:2d6				WIELD:TwoHanded	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT|-3|!PREWEAPONPROF:1,Greatsword (Mercurial)					SPROP:This huge blade hides a secret reservoir of quicksilver (also called mercury by alchemists) that runs along the interior of the blade in a slender channel. When the blade is vertical, the mercury swiftly fills an interior bulb in the haft, but when swung, the heavy liquid flows out into the blade, making it heavier. In nonproficient hands, this shifting mass penalizes the wielder by an additional - 3 penalty to attack rolls, beyond the normal nonproficiency penalty for using an exotic weapon untrained.
Three-Section Staff						PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Three-Section Staff	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Bludgeoning.Wood.Monk.MeleeBludgeoning									COST:4	WT:8				CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8				WIELD:TwoHanded	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.70																SPROP:Originally a farm implement for threshing grain, this weapon is comprised of three sections of wood of equal lengths, joined at the ends b chain, leather, or rope. A monk using a three-section staff (for which she must take an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat due t the weapon's Large size) fights with her unarmed bas attack bonus and her more favorable number of attack per round, along with other applicable attack mod tiers.

# Huge
Fullblade								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Fullblade			TYPE:Weapon.Martial.Exotic.Melee.Slashing.Metal.Sword.MeleeSlashing								COST:100	WT:23				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:2d8				WIELD:TwoHanded	SIZE:L	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	BONUS:WEAPON|WIELDCATEGORY|-1|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Fullblade)			SPROP:A fullblade is 18 inches longer than a greatsword, and is too large for a Medium-size creature to use at all. A Large creature could use the fullblade with one hand, but would suffer the standard -4 nonproficiency penalty to its attack rolls, or with two hands as a martial weapon. A Large creature with the Exotics Weapon proficiency could use the fullblade in one hand with no penalty. A fullblade is also called an ogre's greatsword.

###Block: Ammunition
# Equipment Name	Type					Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Alchemist's Arrow	TYPE:Ammunition.Wood.Arrow	COST:75	WT:0.2	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	SPROP:Marvels of craftsmanship, each alchemist's arrow carries a deadly load of alchemist's fire in its hollow shaft. When a target is struck the arrow's shaft shatters, releasing the alchemist's fire directly onto the target. One round after impact, the alchemist's fire ignites on contact with air, dealing ld4 points of damage. The target can take a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15) to extinguish the flames. Rolling on the ground allows the character a +2 bonus. Submerging (such as by leaping into a lake) or magically extinguishing the flames automatically kills the flames.
Tumbling Bolt	TYPE:Ammunition.Wood.Bolt	COST:50	WT:0.2	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	SPROP:A tumbling bolt resembles a standard crossbow bolt save for a few tiny holes and vent along the shaft. In fact, a tiny channel allows air to pas through the bolt when it is fired which causes the bolt to tumble when fired. Opponents targeted by tumbling bolt can apply only half their Dexterity modifier to their AC (round down) due to the unpredictable tumble of approaching missile.

Fukimi-Bari (Mouth Dart)		KEY:Fukimi-Bari (Mouth Dart)			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Fukimi-Bari (Mouth Dart)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Piercing.Metal.Wood.Thrown.Dart										COST:1	WT:0.1	SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1	WIELD:Light		RANGE:10			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71									BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|-STR		SPROP:These slim, almost needle-like metal darts are concealed in the mouth and then spit at the target. Their effective range is extremely short, and they do little damage, but they are highly useful when taking an opponent by surprise. You can fire up to three mouth darts per attack (all at the same target). Do not apply your Strength modifier to damage with mouth darts. They are too small to carry the extra force that a strong character usually imparts to a thrown weapon. The cost and weight are for a single mouth dart.
Skiprock, Halfling			KEY:Skiprock (Halfling)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Skiprock (Halfling)		TYPE:Ammunition.Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Bludgeoning.Stone.Thrown.Halfling.Skiprock						COST:3	WT:0.25	SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d3	WIELD:Light		RANGE:10			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71															SPROP:These polished, perfectly weighted stones are prized by halflings, for if they throw them just so, they ricochet off one target to strike a second. If the skiprock hits its target, it ricochets toward another target (of the thrower's choice) adjacent to the original target (within 5 feet). The thrower immediately makes a second attack roll for the skiprock against the new target, with an attack bonus equal to the first roll -2. Skiprocks could be used as sling bullets, but using a skiprock's ricochet ability in conjunction with a sling requires taking the Exotic Weapon proficiency specifically for that purpose.
Bolas, 2-ball				KEY:Bolas (2-ball)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Bolas (2-ball)			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Bludgeoning.Wood.Thrown.Bolas										COST:5	WT:2		SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4				RANGE:10			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71															SPROP:A set of 2-ball bolas consists of two heavy wooden spheres connected by lengths of cord. It is a ranged weapon used to trip an opponent. When you throw a set of bolas, you make a ranged touch attack against your opponent. If you hit, your opponent is tripped. if the opponent fails a grapple check versus your original attack roll, the opponent is grappled. Bolas only grapple Medium-size or smaller targets. The opponent can extricate itself from the 2- ball bolas with a full-round action. Your opponent cannot trip you when making a trip attack with the 2- ball bolas.
Skiprock Sling, Halfling		KEY:Skiprock Sling (Halfling)			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Skiprock Sling (Halfling)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Bludgeoning.Container.Projectile.Sling		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Skiprock=1	COST:0	WT:0				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4				RANGE:50			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.74									BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|min(STR,0)	SPROP:These polished, perfectly weighted stones are prized by halflings, for if they throw them just so, they ricochet off one target to strike a second. If the skiprock hits its target, it ricochets toward another target (of the thrower's choice) adjacent to the original target (within 5 feet). The thrower immediately makes a second attack roll for the skiprock against the new target, with an attack bonus equal to the first roll -2. Skiprocks could be used as sling bullets, but using a skiprock's ricochet ability in conjunction with a sling requires taking the Exotic Weapon proficiency specifically for that purpose.
Spinning Javelin											PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Spinning Javelin			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Piercing.Wood.Thrown.Javelin										COST:2	WT:2		SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d8				RANGE:50			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71															SPROP:This light, flexible spear intended for ranged attacks resembles a standard javelin, except for the spiral grooves that run down its length. You can loop a throwing string around the shaft (the other end is tied to your finger). The string imparts spin to the javelin upon release, improving the weapon's accuracy, range, and penetrating power by permitting a harder cast. Looping a string around the javelin is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a casting string around your finger is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, but the same string is reused for multiple javelins. The javelin can be thrown without spinning it, in which case its damage, range, and critical range is that of a standard javelin. If used in melee, treat the spinning javelin as a standard javelin.
Spring-Loaded Gauntlet										PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Spring-Loaded Gauntlet		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Piercing.Metal.Container.Projectile.Crossbow			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Bolt=1		COST:200	WT:4		SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4				RANGE:20			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71															SPROP:This gauntlet possesses a broad ridge of metal that extends along the bottom of the forearm to the edge of the wrist articulation, where a circular orifice is visible. This ridge of metal hides a wondrous spring-loaded mechanism whereby a cross- bow bolt can be expelled with great force, akin to a very small crossbow. You load the gauntlet by inserting a bolt in the hole and pulling back a tiny lever. Loading the spring-loaded gauntlet is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity. You fire the spring-loaded gauntlet by sighting down your arm, then flip your hand back so that your palm faces your opponent-this motion fires the gauntlet. A character who attempts to fire two spring-loaded gauntlets at once suffers the standard penalty for two-weapon fighting. (The Two-Weapon Fighting feat does not reduce these penalties because it represents skill with melee weapons, not ranged weapons. The Ambidexterity feat lets someone avoid the -4 off hand penalty.) The cost and weight are for a single gauntlet.
Crossbow, Great				KEY:Crossbow (Great)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Crossbow (Great)			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Piercing.Wood.Container.Projectile.Crossbow			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Bolt=1		COST:100	WT:15		SLOTS:2	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d12				RANGE:150			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71															SPROP:A great crossbow requires two hands to use effectively, regardless of the user's size. You draw a great crossbow back by turning a winch. Loading a great crossbow is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A Medium-size character cannot shoot or load a great crossbow with one hand at all. With training, a Large-size creature can shoot, but not load, a great crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty. If a Large size creature attempts to fire a separate great crossbow in each hand simultaneously, the standard penalties for two-weapon fighting apply.
Harpoon												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Harpoon				TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Piercing.Metal.Thrown.Spear											COST:15	WT:10		SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d10				RANGE:30			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71									BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT|-2|PRESIZELT:M	SPROP:The harpoon is a broad-bladed spear forged with cruel barbs. The shaft of the harpoon has a trailing rope attached to control harpooned opponents. Though intended to be used in hunting whales and other large sea creatures, the harpoon can be used on dry land. Even if an Exotic Weapon Proficiency is taken for the Harpoon, creatures of less than Medium size suffer a -2 penalty to their attack rolls due to the weapon's weight. If you inflict damage on your opponent, the harpoon may lodge in the victim if the victim fails a Reflex saving throw against a DC equal to 10 plus the damage you inflicted. The harpooned creature moves at only half speed and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the harpooned creature can only move within the limits that the rope allows (the trailing rope is 30 feet long). If the harpooned creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15) or fail, losing the spell. The harpooned creature can pull the harpoon from its wound if it has two free hands and it takes a full-round action to do so, but in so doing it inflicts damage on itself equal to the initial damage the harpoon caused. If you hit with a harpoon and do 8 points of damage and the target removes the harpoon, it takes another 8 points of damage.
Shotput, Orc				KEY:Shotput (Orc)					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Shotput (Orc)			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Bludgeoning.Metal.Thrown.Orc										COST:10	WT:15		SLOTS:1	CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:2d6				RANGE:10			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.71									BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT|-3|PRESIZELT:M	SPROP:Special training turns a grapefruitsized sphere of crude iron into a deadly missile. Even with the Exotic Weapon feat, a wielder must be Medium-size or larger to use the weapon effectively (or suffer an additional -3 penalty to attack roll addition to the standard nonproficiency penalty).

A mighty whip or mighty whip dagger is made with especially heavy material that allows a strong character to take advantage of an aboveaverage Strength score. The mighty whip allows you to add your Strength bonus to subdual damage for a whip (and normal damage if the lasher prestige class is chosen), and to standard damage for a mighty whip dagger, up to the maximum bonus listed on the chart above.

A mighty whip or mighty whip dagger is made with especially heavy material that allows a strong character to take advantage of an aboveaverage Strength score. The mighty whip allows you to add your Strength bonus to subdual damage for a whip (and normal damage if the lasher prestige class is chosen), and to standard damage for a mighty whip dagger, up to the maximum bonus listed on the chart above.

(You do not need to take a separate feat to use the whip dagger if you already have a feat for the whip.) The whip dagger is heavier than a standard whip and deals normal damage due to the barbs that run along its length and the dagger-like tip (which inflicts deep wounds when accelerated to strike by a proficient user) Unlike standard whips, armor bonuses and natural armor bonuses do not hinder its ability to deal damage. Although you keep it in hand, treat it as a ranged weapon with a maximum range of 15 feet and no range penalties. Because the whip dagger can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip dagger to avoid being tripped. You get a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed yourself if you fail to disarm your opponent).
