Whirlwind MC	KEY:Whirlwind ~ Djinni MC	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A djinni can transform itself into a whirlwind once per day|PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,Djinni Monster Class=7	DESC:A djinni can transform itself into a whirlwind three times per day|PRECLASS:1,Djinni Monster Class=8|PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,Djinni Monster Class=11	DESC:A djinni can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes|PRECLASS:1,Djinni Monster Class=12	DESC:remain in that form for up to 7 rounds. In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. A djinni's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the djinni enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the djinni moves into or through the creature's space. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A creature with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racial adjustment. Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the djinni carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The djinni can have only as many trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume. The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be.  If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and does not threaten the area around it.

Plane Shift MC	KEY:Plane Shift ~ Djinni MC	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike	VISIBLE:YES	DESC:A Djinni can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane.	DESC:This ability (2/day) transports the Djinni.|PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,Djinni Monster Class=6	DESC:This ability (2/day) transports the Djinni and one other creature, provided they link hands with the Djinni.|PRECLASS:1,Djinni Monster Class=7|PRECLASSLEVELMAX:1,Djinni Monster Class=11	DESC:This ability (at will) transports the Djinni and up to six other creatures, provided they all link hands with the Djinni.|PRECLASS:1,Djinni Monster Class=12	DESC:It is otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster level 13th, PHB p 262). Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles [5d%%] from your intended destination. Note: Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.
