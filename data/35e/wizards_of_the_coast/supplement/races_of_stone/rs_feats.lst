It takes a move action to pick up an ally and a standard action to throw that ally. You make a ranged touch attack (against AC 5) to throw the ally to the chosen square. If the touch attack hits, the ally lands in the square you designate. If the touch attack is a miss, randomly determine in which square the ally lands, using the Missing with a Thrown Weapon diagram on page 158 of the Player's Handbook. If the ally lands in a square that is occupied, she lands prone in that square. In any case, the ally doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement. Allies one size category smaller than you have a range increment of 5 feet, while allies two size categories or more smaller than you have a range increment of 15 feet. If you have the Improved Rock Hurling feat or the racial ability to throw rocks, the range increments improve to 20 feet and 40 feet respectively.

For every 5 points by which your grapple check beats your foe's grapple check or Escape Artist check, you can throw that foe 10 feet. Your foe lands prone in the square you designate. You can't throw a foe farther than you could throw an ally (as described in the Fling Ally feat). You must be strong enough to lift an enemy over your head (the enemy's weight cannot exceed your character's maximum load) to throw him. See page 162 of the Player's Handbook for more information on carrying capacity and maximum load. The enemy does not provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement.

(The effect is a mind-affecting ability.) When the goaded opponent starts its next turn, if it threatens you and has line of sight to you, it must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). If the opponent fails its save, you are the only creature it can make melee attacks against during this turn. (If it kills you, knocks you unconscious, loses sight of you, or otherwise is unable to make melee attacks against you, it may make any remaining melee attacks against other foes, as normal.) A goaded creature can still cast spells, make ranged attacks, move, or perform other actions normally. The use of this feat restricts only melee attacks. Special: A fighter may select Goad as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38 of the Player's Handbook).

A weapon is treated as being associated with a race if the race's name appears as part of the weapon's name, such as the gnome swordcatcher (see page 155) or the dwarven urgrosh. Normal: Without this feat, a character must select the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat (or have the appropriate weapon familiarity as a racial trait) to eliminate the nonproficiency penalty he takes when wielding an exotic weapon associated with his race. Special: A fighter may select Improved Weapon Familiarity as one of her fighter bonus feats (see page 38 of the Player's Handbook).

Metamagic Song				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:BardicMusic		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.BardicMusic										PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE.Metamagic																																																																																PRETEXT:Any two metamagic feats, bardic music.																																	DESC:You can channel the power of your bardic music into your magic, allowing you to pay the cost of metamagic feats by spending uses of your bardic music ability.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.142	BENEFIT:When you spontaneously cast an arcane spell that is enhanced by a metamagic feat, you can spend a number of uses of your bardic music ability equal to the number of extra levels that the metamagic feat imposes on the spell rather than raising the spell's effective level. Applying metamagic spontaneously using this method increases the casting time of the spell normally. You cannot use the Metamagic Song feat to add metamagic feats that would make the spell's effective level higher than the highest level of spell that you can cast normally. Special: When applying a metamagic feat to a spell, you must either use Metamagic Song to completely offset the increase in the spell's effective level or apply the metamagic feat normally and cast the spell at its higher level. You cannot partially increase the level of the spell (or "split" the cost) to reduce the number of uses of bardic music spent when using the Metamagic Song feat. Only one method can be used to pay for metamagic feats that affect a single spell. You cannot use the Metamagic Song feat to improve a spell with the Silent Spell metamagic feat.
