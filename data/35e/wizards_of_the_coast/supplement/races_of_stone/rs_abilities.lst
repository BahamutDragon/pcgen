When presented with a pit, chasm, or other surface too steep to walk down, it attempts to climb. If the creature is presented with more than one way to go and it does not know which way might lead deeper under the earth, it chooses randomly. A successful save means the creature is immune to that earth whisper's cavern fear ability for 24 hours, but not the cavern fear ability of other earth whispers. This ability only functions underground. Should the affected creature be pushed or forcibly moved into the open, it cowers. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
