# Ability Name				Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type											Combat bonus					Wield Category bonus		Source Page		Benefits
Powerful Build				KEY:Goliath ~ Powerful Build		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Race Trait.Goliath Race Trait	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT.GRAPPLE|4|PRESIZELT:C	BONUS:WIELDCATEGORY|ALL|-1	SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:The physical stature of a goliath let's him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger. Whenever a goliath is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the goliath is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A goliath is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A goliath can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.
Mountain Movement				KEY:Goliath ~ Mountain Movement	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Race Trait.Goliath Race Trait													SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:Because goliaths practically live on the ledges and cliffs of the most forbidding mountains, they are particularly adept at negotiating mountain hazards. Goliaths can make standing long jumps and high Jumps as if they were running long jumps and high Jumps. A goliath can engage in accelerated climbing (climbing half his speed as a move action) without taking the -5 penalty on the Climb check.
Acclimated					KEY:Goliath ~ Acclimated		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Race Trait.Goliath Race Trait													SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:Goliaths are automatically acclimated to life at high altitude. They don't take the penalties for altitude described in the Mountian Travel section on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Unlike other denizens of the mountains, goliaths don't lose their acclimation to high altitude even if they spend a long time at a lower elevation.
+2 bonus on Sense Motive checks	KEY:Goliath ~ Racial Bonus		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Race Trait.Goliath Race Trait													SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:When speaking to one another, goliaths tend to augment their verbal communication wl1h subtle body language. They are likewise able to read the unintentional body language of others.

Smite Giants		KEY:Dwarf Cleric ~ Smite Giants		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dwarf Cleric Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dwarf cleric who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can attempt to smite a giant with a melee attack, similar to the way a paladin smites an evil creature. She adds her Constitution bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per cleric level. The cleric can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Con modifier (minimum once per day). If the cleric accidentally smites a creature that is not a giant, the smite has no effect but still counts as one of the cleric's daily smite attempts. This substitution benefit replaces the standard cleric's ability to turn or rebuke undead.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.146

A dwarf cleric who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency (warhammer) feat (if she doesn't already have it). She also gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when wielding a warhammer in melee. This racial substitution level is only available to dwarf clerics who follow Moradin (or any other deity whose favored weapon is a warhammer). This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 2nd-level cleric spell than indicated on Table 3-6, page 31 of the Player's Handbook.

When she is in contact with the ground, the cleric's effective caster level when casting spells with the earth descriptor (or any spell from the Earth domain, such as stoneskin) increases by one. This increase applies when determining level-dependent spell variables and on caster level checks. This increase stacks with other spell power abilities, such as from the hierophant prestige class. This benefit replaces the 4th-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 8th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 4th-level cleric spell than indicated on Table 3-6, page 31 of the Player's Handbook.
