### Block: War Weaver
Eldritch Tapestry		KEY:War Weaver ~ Eldritch Tapestry		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.War Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:You can thread together unseen strands of life force to connect willing allies in a magically resonant network known as an eldritch tapestry. Doing so takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 15 Craft [weaving] check. When you weave an eldritch tapestry, you can connect %1 allies. Creatures must be within line of sight to have their life force woven into an eldritch tapestry, and they must be living creatures. An eldritch tapestry lasts for 24 hours or until you weave a new one. You're always connected to your own eldritch tapestry, and you don't count against the limit of allies that can be connected. Once you have woven an eldritch tapestry, you can send your spells across the life-force strands to your allies. Although you cast but a single spell, you can have it affect every creature in your eldritch tapestry as if the group were a single creature. The maximum level of spell you can cast into an eldritch tapestry is %2. Only spells with the "harmless" designation in their saving throw entry or ones requiring willing targets can be cast into an eldritch tapestry. In addition, spells with a range of personal cannot be cast through an eldritch tapestry. If a spell has a costly material component or an XP cost, you must expend one casting's worth of the material component or pay the XP cost for each creature targeted by the spell, including yourself. An eldritch tapestry doesn't change the range of a spell. You can touch as many willing targets as you can reach as part of the casting, but all targets must be touched in the same round you finish casting the spell. You can exclude specific creatures connected to an eldritch tapestry from a spell if you like. If the spell requires decision-making on your part, you must make the same decision for everyone the spell is meant to affect. An eldritch tapestry doesn't allow your spells to affect illegal targets. You can't affect objects with spells cast into your eldritch tapestry, even if those objects are held by your allies.|WarWeaverEldritchTapestryAllyCount|classlevel("War Weaver")		DEFINE:WarWeaverEldritchTapestryAllyCount|0	BONUS:VAR|WarWeaverEldritchTapestryAllyCount|max(INT,CHA)
Quiescent Weaving		KEY:War Weaver ~ Quiescent Weaving		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.War Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:You can weave %1 spells into your eldritch tapestry for later use. The maximum level of spell that you can weave into your eldritch tapestry with this ability is %2. Quiescent weaving enables you to prepare beneficial spells you know your allies will need in a crisis. You can release the quiescent spells right away at the beginning of a fight, then commence with more offensive spellcasting. To make a quiescent weave, you must designate the eldritch tapestry as the target for the spell as you cast it [regardless of what the spellâ€™s normal target is]. The spell is now woven into the eldritch tapestry in a dormant state; it doesn't use up its duration or affect targets in any way. As a move action, you can release all the spells in your quiescent weaving. They immediately and instantaneously take effect in the order they were cast. The same restrictions apply to a quiescent weaving that apply to any other spell woven into an eldritch tapestry. The quiescent spells affect only legal targets at the time you release them.|(classlevel("War Weaver")-1)|classlevel("War Weaver")
Enlarged Tapestry		KEY:War Weaver ~ Enlarged Tapestry		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.War Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		VISIBLE:YES		DESC:You can stretch your magic across your eldritch tapestry beyond normal distances. Spells you cast through an eldritch tapestry have their range category increased: touch spells become close range, close-range spells become medium range, and medium-range spells become long range. Long-range spells and spells with fixed ranges are unaffected.
