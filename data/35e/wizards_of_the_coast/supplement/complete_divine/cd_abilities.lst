Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Blighter ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	DESC:Blighters gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.
Spells per Day			KEY:Blighter ~ Spells per Day					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.23	DESC:Since blighters are ex-druids, they lose their druid spellcasting abilities. However, they gain access to new, more destructive spells. At each blighter level, the character gains spells per day according to Table 2-3. She must choose her spells from the blighter spell list, below. The blighter's caster level is equal to her blighter level plus her druid level. To cast a blighter spell, a blighter must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blighter with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blighter bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blighter's Wisdom modifier. When the blighter gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance 2nd-level spells for a 2ndlevel blighter), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The blighter's spell list appears below. A blighter has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a druid. A blighter prepares and casts spells just as a druid does (though a blighter cannot spontaneously cast summon spells). The blighter gains access to her daily spells through deforestation (see below).

If a potentially affected plant is under the control of another (such as a druid's liveoak or a dryad's home tree), the controller can make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blighter level + blighter's Wis modifier) to keep it alive. Affected plants immediately cease photosynthesis, root tapping, and all other methods of sustenance. Like picked flowers, they appear vibrant for several hours, but within a day, they turn brown and wither. Except for plants selected by a controller, nothing can grow in a deforested area until it has a hallow spell cast upon it and it is reseeded. Deforestation enables a blighter to cast her daily allotment of spells. This ability works in any terrain, but deforesting a sandy desert, ice floe, or other environment with only sparse vegetation does not empower the character to cast spells.
Blightfire				KEY:Blighter ~ Blightfire					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, as a standard action, a blighter can unleash a scorching blast of fire. This effect deals 5d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet (Reflex half; save DC is 10 + blighter's class level + blighter's Wis modifier) and ignites flammable objects it touches. Blighters delight in starting wildfires and often use this ability to do so.

The blighter's animal form is altered as follows: - Type changes to undead. - Natural armor bonus is +0 (Tiny animal), +1 (Small), +2 (Medium or Large), or +3 (Huge). - +2 Dexterity, no Constitution score. - Immunity to cold. - Damage reduction 5/bludgeoning. The blighter gains one extra use per day of this ability at every even blighter level after 3rd. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large skeletal animal at 5th level and a Huge skeletal animal at 9th level.
Speak with Dead Animal		KEY:Blighter ~ Speak with Dead Animal			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a blighter can converse with dead animals. This ability functions like a speak with dead spell cast by a cleric of a level equal to the total of the character's druid and blighter levels, except that it affects only corpses of animal creatures. It is usable once per day.
Contagious Touch			KEY:Blighter ~ Contagious Touch				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:At 5th level and higher, a blighter can produce an effect like that of a contagious touch spell once per day.

Unbond				KEY:Blighter ~ Unbond						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a blighter can temporarily separate a bonded animal or magical beast (such as an animal companion, familiar, or mount) from its master once per day. The target creature must be within 40 feet of both its master and the blighter. If the master fails a Will save (DC 10 + blighter level + blighter's Wis modifier), the bond terminates as if the servitor had died, though this does not cause experience loss in the case of a familiar. Normally hostile creatures attack their masters but are otherwise unaffected. The bond returns after 1 minute per blighter level, restoring all benefits. Alternatively, the master can regain the servitor through the normal methods of acquisition.
Plague				KEY:Blighter ~ Plague						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Blighter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:At 10th level and higher, a blighter can spread disease over a large area. This ability functions like the contagious touch ability, except that no attack roll is required and it affects all targets the blighter designates within a 20-foot radius. Plague is usable once per day.

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Church Inquisitor ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Church Inquisitor Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.27	DESC:A church inquisitor continues advancing in divine spellcasting ability as well as learning the skills of inquisition. Thus, when a new church inquisitor level is gained, the character gains new divine spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, more frequent remove disease, and so on). This means that he adds the level of church inquisitor to the level of another divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a church inquisitor, the player must decide which class to assign each level of church inquisitor for the purpose of determining divine spells per day and spells known.

This ability undoes the effect of alter self, polymorph, shapechange, and alternate form abilities, whether exceptional, spell-like, or supernatural in nature. The affected creature cannot change its shape again for 1d6 rounds. The church inquisitor can use this ability at will.

Spells per Day			KEY:Consecrated Harrier ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Consecrated Harrier Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.28	DESC:A consecrated harrier gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the consecrated harrier must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a consecrated harrier with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast spells. Consecrated harrier bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Wis modifier. When the consecrated harrier gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance 0 1st-level spells at 1st level), the harrier gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The consecrated harrier uses the ranger spell list, with the following additions: 1st-animate rope, calm emotions, command, disguise self, doom; 2nd-charm person, daylight, detect thoughts, hold person; 3rd-clairaudience/clairvoyance, death ward, discern lies, see invisibility; 4th-dismissal, dominate person, legend lore, mark of justice.

This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and to +6 at 10th level.

The effect must be centered on the consecrated harrier. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).
Implacable Hunt			KEY:Consecrated Harrier ~ Implacable Hunt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Consecrated Harrier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.29	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, if the consecrated harrier wounds a target and the target escapes, the consecrated harrier always knows the direction in which her target lies and the approximate distance (within 10%% of the total distance) between her and her target. If the target is within 50 feet, the consecrated harrier can pinpoint the target's precise location. This ability only works if the consecrated harrier and her target are on the same plane of existence. Implacable hunt can be used simultaneously against different targets, as long as each of those individual targets is part of a group that is, in total, the harrier's target for her current mission.
Faultless Hunt			KEY:Consecrated Harrier ~ Faultless Hunt				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Consecrated Harrier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:At 10th level, a consecrated harrier who establishes an implacable hunt can intensify this to a faultless hunt, enabling her to locate her quarry even across planar boundaries. Unlike an implacable hunt, which can affect several individuals at the same time, only one faultless hunt against a single individual can be pursued at one time. For the consecrated harrier to begin a faultless hunt, she must abandon any faultless hunt that she is already conducting.
Code of Conduct			KEY:Consecrated Harrier ~ Code of Conduct				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Consecrated Harrier Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:A consecrated harrier must make it known to her target who she is and why she is there at the time of the confrontation. She cannot sneak attack her target. She cannot slay her target on a battlefield without the target knowing who she is and why she is there. Consecrated harriers purposely word the requirements for conducting themselves vaguely, so that an individual consecrated harrier in the field has some flexibility. Harriers who fail to act according to their code of conduct must undertake an act of atonement before they can add any further levels of this class (see the atonement spell description, page 201 of the Player's Handbook).
Multiclass Note			KEY:Consecrated Harrier ~ Multiclass Note				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Consecrated Harrier Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.30	DESC:A paladin who becomes a consecrated harrier may continue advancing as a paladin.

Sample deities are provided on Table 3-7: Deities, page 32 of the Player's Handbook, and also in Chapter 5 of this book. A divine crusader's chosen deity influences heralignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. The character's alignment and her deity's alignment must match exactly. A divine crusader chooses one domain from among those offered by that deity to his or her clerics and gains the granted power of the domain. (If the domain granted power includes the addition of a skill or skills to the cleric class skill list, add it to the class skill list for the divine crusader instead.) The divine crusader also gains the ability to cast spells from that domain (see below).

She may only prepare and cast spells from her chosen domain (see above). Effectively, a divine crusader has a class spell list of only nine spells (one per spell level). To prepare or cast a spell, a divine crusader must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The difficulty class for a saving throw against a divine crusader's spell is 10 + the spell level + the divine crusader's Cha modifier. The divine crusader also gets bonus spells based on her Charisma. A divine crusader prepares and casts spells as a cleric, except that she cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells.

###Block: Entropomancer

Shard of Entropy			KEY:Entropomancer ~ Shard of Entropy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entropomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	DESC:Twice per day, for a maximum of 1 round per entropomancer level, the character can create a miniature shard of entropy. The shard is a chunk of absolute blackness, 2 inches across, and can be moved up to 30 feet by the entropomancer as a standard action. Against objects, the shard deals 3d6 points of damage, bypassing the object's hardness. Against creatures, the entro po mancer must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if successful the shard deals 3d6 points of damage to the target (Fortitude half, DC 12 + the entropomancer's Wis modifier). The shard appears in any square adjacent to the entropomancer when it is created, and it can be used to attack on the round it is formed. The shard of entropy lurches, jumps, and bounces around the square it's in. Any creature who passes through the shard's square takes damage as if the shard struck him (Fortitude half), as does any creature that's in the same square as the shard at the beginning of the entropomancer's turn. The entropomancer can move the shard into another square with a move action, or aim it at a specific creature (dealing damage immediately) as a standard action. At 5th level, the entropomancer can use the shard to create a deeper connection to absolute nothingness. The shard of entropy deals 5d6 points of damage (Fortitude half, DC 14 + entropomancer's Wis modifier). At 9th level, the shard of entropy becomes even stronger, dealing 7d6 points of damage (Fortitude half, DC 16 + entropomancer's Wis modifier). It also exerts an inexorable tug on creatures nearby, pulling them toward the shard. At the end of the entropomancer's turn, the shard tries to pull creatures within 15 feet closer to it. This is treated as a bull rush attempt, for which the shard has a +11 bonus. If the shard wins the opposed check, it bull rushes creatures in a direct line toward its square. The entropomancer isn't immune to this effect.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Entropomancer ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entropomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	DESC:Whenever an evennumbered level in the prestige class is gained, the entropomancer gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class in which he could cast 4th-level divine spells before she added the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class in which she could cast 4th-level spells before she became an entropomancer, she must decide to which class she adds each level of entropomancer for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Entropic Field			KEY:Entropomancer ~ Entropic Field				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entropomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	DESC:As a standard action, an entropomancer can surround herself with a field of invisible, entropic energy that lasts for 1 round per entropomancer level. The field extends in a 5-foot per entropomancer level radius, centered on the entropomancer. All magical healing automatically fails within the entropic field. It takes the entropomancer a standard action to dismiss the entropic field. At 5th level, the entropic field becomes strong enough to warp the laws of probability. Once per round, as a free action, the entropomancer can force a character within the field (including herself) to reroll an attack, save, or check. The entropomancer demands the reroll after she knows whether the attack, save, or check succeeded or failed, but before the exact consequences have been calculated and applied. The result of the reroll takes precedence, even if it's worse than the original roll. At 7th level, the entropic field causes wounds created within it to continue bleeding, dealing an additional 1 point of damage per round thereafter (at the end of the entropomancer's turn) as long as they remain within the entropic field. A successful Heal check (DC 15) stops the bleeding. If multiple wounds are suffered, then the creature takes 1 point of damage per wound. The entropomancer is subject to the bleeding effect.
Control Sphere			KEY:Entropomancer ~ Control Sphere				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Entropomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	DESC:The entropomancer has the ability to control a sphere of annihilation (described on page 279 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) as if he were using a talisman of the sphere, and the entropomancer is personally unaffected by a sphere of annihilation, which passes through him as if his square was completely empty. High-level entropomancers are often obsessed with acquiring spheres of annihilation.

###Block: Evangelist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Evangelist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:Evangelists gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.
Great Orator			KEY:Evangelist ~ Great Orator					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:An evangelist can inspire, protect, and otherwise improve the situation of his allies simply by speaking clearly and being heard. This ability is similar to the bard's bardic music ability (see page 29 of the Player's Handbook for a complete description) and, indeed, evangelist levels stack with bard levels to determine the strength of known bard songs. For example, a bard 3/evangelist 5 improves his inspire competence ability, but does not gain any new bard abilities. He could use bardic music to convert the unfaithful, countersong, fascinate, inspire the righteous, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, but would not gain the inspire competence, inspire greatness, or suggestion abilities. Alternately, a bard 7/evangelist 1 would be able to use bardic music to countersong, fascinate, inspire competence, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, and suggestion. Evangelist oratory abilities function in exactly the same manner as bardic music except the evangelist must speak loudly and clearly, rather than sing or play an instrument.
Inspire Dread			KEY:Evangelist ~ Inspire Dread				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:An evil evangelist with 9 or more ranks in Perform (oratory) can inspire hopelessness in all enemies within 30 feet. This ability imposes a -4 penalty on Will saves on all enemies within 30 feet of the evangelist. Delivering this oratory requires a full-round action to activate and requires concentration each round to continue the effect. The effect lasts as long as the evangelist speaks and for 3 rounds thereafter. Inspire dread is a mind-affecting ability.
Inspire Hope			KEY:Evangelist ~ Inspire Hope					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:A good or neutral evangelist with 9 or more ranks in Perform (oratory) can inspire spiritual resilience in all allies within 30 feet. This ability gives the evangelist and all allies who can hear his oratory a +4 sacred bonus on Will saves. Delivering this oratory requires a fullround action to activate and requires concentration each round to continue the effect. The effect lasts as long as the evangelist speaks and for three rounds thereafter. Inspire hope is a mind-affecting ability.
Inflame the Righteous		KEY:Evangelist ~ Inflame the Righteous			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:An evangelist of 3rd level or higher with 11 or more ranks in Perform (oratory) can use this ability to wreath himself and any of his allies within 30 feet in divine flame. Each beneficiary of this ability gains the benefit of a fire shield spell. Use the evangelist's level +5 to determine the caster level of the spell. The damage caused by the spell is, however, purely divine and not subject to a creature's resistance or immunity to fire. This oratory requires a full-round action to perform and requires concentration each round to continue the effect. The effect lasts as long as the evangelist speaks and for three rounds thereafter.
Convert the Unfaithful		KEY:Evangelist ~ Convert the Unfaithful			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:An evangelist of 5th level with at least 13 ranks in Perform (oratory) may attempt to convert a single enemy within 30 feet. As a full-round action, the evangelist delivers an impassioned speech on the righteousness of his beliefs to a single enemy, who must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + class level + Cha mod). If the creature succeeds, it is shaken for one round. If the creature fails its saving throw, it converts. Creatures with an alignment subtype (such as angels and devils) are immune to this ability. A converted creature is effectively charmed by the evangelist (similar to a charm monster spell). In addition, a converted creature temporarily assumes the alignment of the evangelist and acts accordingly. This may mean some of the creature's class abilities, spells, or other abilities are unavailable to it for the duration of the spell (a paladin converted to something other than lawful good, for example, loses her class abilities for the duration). When the duration elapses, the creature then has a choice: It can continue to act according to its new alignment, or it can shift back. If the creature chooses to permanently change its alignment to the evangelist's, it acts as if a cleric of the appropriate alignment had cast atonement on it. If the creature chooses to change back, it must make another saving throw (with the same save DC as before). If it fails this saving throw its alignment changes back but it needs an atonement spell to gain back any abilities it lost due to its temporary alignment change.
Fast Talk				KEY:Evangelist ~ Fast Talk					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:At 2nd level, the evangelist knows the right thing to say at the right time. He may make a rushed Diplomacy check as a full-round action at only a -5 penalty.
Skill Mastery			KEY:Evangelist ~ Skill Mastery				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Evangelist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:At 4th level, the evangelist becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, the evangelist selects a number of skills equal to 1 + his Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) from the following list: Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, and Sense Motive. When making a skill check with one of the selected skills, he may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so.

###Block: Geomancer
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Geomancer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:Geomancers gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Geomancer ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:At each geomancer level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (additional wild shape options, metamagic or item creation feats, or the like). Since the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a geomancer, the player must decide to which class to add each geomancer level for determining spells per day and spells known.
Spell Versatility			KEY:Geomancer ~ Spell Versatility				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:At 1st level, the geomancer learns to blend divine and arcane magic. He still acquires and prepares his spells in the normal manner for his individual spellcasting classes. When he casts them, however, he can mix or match spellcasting parameters from any of his classes to gain the maximum possible advantage for any spell with a spell level equal to or less than his spell versatility score. Thus, as a 4th-level geomancer, he can cast any of his 3rd-level or lower sorcerer/wizard spells with no chance of arcane spell failure from armor. (The druidic prohibition against metal armor still applies to druid/geomancers, however, since this stricture stems from a spiritual oath rather than a practical limitation.) The geomancer may use his Wisdom modifier to set the save DC for arcane spells, or his Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever he would normally use for arcane spells) to set the save DC for divine spells. If a spell requires either an arcane material component or a divine focus, he may use either. A cleric/geomancer who also has levels of wizard, sorcerer, or bard can spontaneously convert any prepared arcane or divine spell (except a domain spell) of an appropriate level into a cure or inflict spell of equal or lower level, though he must be capable of casting the latter as a cleric.
Drift					KEY:Geomancer ~ Drift						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:The character slowly becomes closer to nature.

Ley Lines				KEY:Geomancer ~ Ley Lines					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Geomancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:At 2nd level, the geomancer learns to create magical connections with a specific type of terrain. Choose one of the following terrain types: aquatic, desert, forest, hills, marsh, mountains, or plains. In that terrain, the geomancer's effective caster level for all spells increases by +1. At 6th level and again at 10th level, the character may either choose a new terrain in which to receive the benefit (at +1), or increase his effective caster level in a previously chosen terrain by an additional +1.

###Block: Holy Liberator
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Holy liberators are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.
Spells per Day			KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:A holy liberator has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the holy liberator must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a holy liberator with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Holy liberator bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the holy liberator's Wisdom modifier. When the holy liberator gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, he gets only bonus spells. (A holy liberator without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level.) The holy liberator uses the paladin spell list, with a few changes. The holy liberator's spell list does not include any spells with the law descriptor. The following spells are added to the holy liberator's spell list: 1st-protection from law; 2nd-heroism; 3rd-magic circle against law; 4th-dispel law, freedom of movement. A holy liberator prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though the liberator cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells).
Aura of Good			KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Aura of Good				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:The power of a holy liberator's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to his class level plus his cleric level, if any.
Detect Evil				KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Detect Evil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:The holy liberator can use detect evil as a spell-like ability at will.
Smite Evil				KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Smite Evil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Once per day, a holy liberator may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. For example, a 9th-level holy liberator armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+9 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses for high Strength or magical effects that normally apply. If the holy liberator accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. At 5th level, the holy liberator may smite evil twice per day, and at 10th level three times per day.
Remove Fatigue			KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Remove Fatigue				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:A holy liberator of 2nd level or higher can eliminate fatigue in any creature he touches. Using this ability is a standard action; the holy liberator may use it a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.
Aura of Resolve			KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Aura of Resolve			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, the holy liberator gains immunity to all charm and compulsion effects. His mind is his own, and no other creature can control his thoughts or actions. Each ally within 10 feet of him gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm or compulsion effects. This ability functions while the holy liberator is conscious, but not if he is unconscious or dead.
Divine Grace			KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Divine Grace				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:A holy liberator of 4th level or higher applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.
Break Enchantment			KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Break Enchantment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a holy liberator can use break enchantment once per week. He can use this ability twice per week at 8th level.
Celestial Companion		KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Celestial Companion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:Upon reaching 6th level, a holy liberator gains the service of a celestial companion (a cat, eagle, hawk, warhorse, owl, pony, riding dog, or wolf) to serve him in his struggle against tyranny (see sidebar). The creature has the celestial template (see page 31 of the Monster Manual). This creature may willingly act as a guardian (such as a hawk), a helper (such as a cat), or a mount (such as a horse). Once per day, as a full-round action, a holy liberator may magically call his companion from the celestial realms in which it resides. The companion immediately appears adjacent to the holy liberator and remains for 2 hours per holy liberator level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The companion is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the holy liberator may release a particular companion from service (if it has grown too old to join her struggle, for instance). Each time the companion is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The companion also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed (including barding, saddle, and the like for mounts). Calling the companion is a conjuration (calling) effect. Should the holy liberator's companion die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The liberator may not call another companion for thirty days or until he gains a liberator level, whichever comes first, even if the companion is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the liberator takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls. Treat the companion as a special mount for the purpose of spells that specifically affect a paladin's special mount (such as heal mount).
Code of Conduct			KEY:Holy Liberator ~ Code of Conduct			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Holy Liberator Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:Holy liberators must be of chaotic good alignment and lose all special class abilities if they ever willingly commit an act of evil. True to their alignment, holy liberators have no more formalized code of conduct than that.

###Block: Hospitaler
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Hospitaler ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hospitaler Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:Hospitalers gain proficiency with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.
Lay on Hands			KEY:Hospitaler ~ Lay on Hands					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hospitaler Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:A hospitaler with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her hospitaler level times her Charisma modifier. A hospitaler may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action. If the hospitaler has this ability from another class, her levels in those classes stack to determine the total number of hit points of damage she can heal each day.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Hospitaler ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hospitaler Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:A hospitaler continues advancing in divine spellcasting ability as well as learning the skills of the hospitalers. Thus, when a new hospitaler level is gained (except for 1st, 5th, and 9th levels), the character gains new divine spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had gained a level in the a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, greater damage with the smite evil ability, and so on). If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a hospitaler, the player must decide to which class to add each hospitaler level for the purposes of determining spells per day and spells known.
Bonus Feat				KEY:Hospitaler ~ Bonus Feat					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hospitaler Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:At the indicated levels, a hospitaler may take a bonus feat. These feats are drawn from the feats designated as fighter bonus feats (in the Player's Handbook and elsewhere).
Remove Disease			KEY:Hospitaler ~ Remove Disease				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hospitaler Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a hospitaler can use remove disease as a spell-like ability once per week. At 7th level and higher, she can use this ability twice per week.
Code of Conduct			KEY:Hospitaler ~ Code of Conduct				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hospitaler Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:Hospitalers take an oath of poverty, obedience, and defense of those in their care. This does not mean that hospitalers live mean, penny-pinching lives. They share their wealth among themselves and give any excess to their order. Obedience is not related to character or social rank, but rather to position assigned within the order, and often changes with the situation. Regardless of their relative ranks, all hospitalers defer to the head of a facility while on the grounds. Hospitalers must be willing to lay down their lives to protect the pilgrims or hospitaler facilities under their care, but should not do so recklessly.
Multiclass Note			KEY:Hospitaler ~ Multiclass Note				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hospitaler Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:A paladin who becomes a hospitaler may continue advancing as a paladin.

If a pious templar has a smite evil or smite ability (for being a paladin or a cleric with the Destruction domain) already, she can use the ability one extra time per day (two extra times at 7th level).

#Spells per Day			KEY:Pious Templar ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pious Templar Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	DESC:A pious templar has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the pious templar must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a pious templar with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Pious templar bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the pious templar's Wisdom modifier. When the pious templar gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, she gets only bonus spells. (A pious templar without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level.) A pious templar has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just like a cleric. A pious templar prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though the pious templar cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells). A good pious templar (or a neutral pious templar of a good deity) uses the paladin spell list. An evil pious templar (or a neutral pious templar of an evil deity) uses the blackguard spell list. A pious templar who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can chose to use the paladin or the blackguard spell list. Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed.

Thundering Weapon			KEY:Stormlord ~ Thundering Weapon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stormlord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:For a stormlord of 5th level or higher, any spear or javelin he uses is treated as a thundering weapon (see page 225 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The weapon loses this ability 1 round after leaving the hand of the stormlord. This effect stacks with that of the stormlord's shock weapon ability.
Storm Ride				KEY:Stormlord ~ Storm Ride					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stormlord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:At 6th level, a stormlord gains the ability to fly during any storm as if using the fly spell. Adverse wind conditions do not affect him; for example, even hurricane- force winds cannot knock him down or blow him away when flying.
Shocking Burst Weapon		KEY:Stormlord ~ Shocking Burst Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stormlord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:For a stormlord of 8th level or higher, any spear or javelin he uses is treated as a shocking burst weapon. The weapon loses this ability 1 round after leaving the hand of the stormlord. This effect stacks with that of the stormlord's thundering weapon ability.
Storm of Elemental Fury		KEY:Stormlord ~ Storm of Elemental Fury			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stormlord Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:At 10th level, a stormlord can summon a storm of great magnitude and power. Once per day, a stormlord can use storm of elemental fury as if he were a 17th-level cleric.

###Block: Temple Raider Of Olidammara
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:Temple raiders gain proficiency with all simple weapons and with the rapier. In addition, they gain proficiency with light and medium armor.
Spells per Day			KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:A temple raider has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a temple raider spell, a temple raider must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a temple raider with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Temple raider bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the temple raider's Wisdom modifier. When the temple raider gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level temple raider), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The temple raider's spell list appears below. A temple raider has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A temple raider prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a temple raider cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells). A temple raider must spend 1 hour each night in quiet contemplation and supplication to Olidammara to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether he can prepare spells.
Trapfinding				KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Trapfinding					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:Like rogues, temple raiders can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. They can also use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A temple raider who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.
Trap Sense				KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Trap Sense					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:A temple raider has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by an additional +1 every three levels above 1st (to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th, and +4 at 10th).
Sneak Attack			KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:At 2nd level, a temple raider gains the ability to sneak attack opponents. This functions identically to the rogue's sneak attack ability (see the Rogue section in Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook). At 2nd level, the temple raider's extra damage on a successful sneak attack is +1d6, and this rises by +1d6 per three temple raider levels thereafter. If he already has the sneak attack ability from a previous class, the damage bonuses stack.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Uncanny Dodge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:At 3rd level, a temple raider gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity modifier to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity modifier to AC if immobilized. If a temple raider already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:A temple raider of 6th level or higher can no longer be flanked; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies an enemy the ability to sneak attack the temple raider by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has temple raider levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class, the levels from the class(es) that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the temple raider. For example, only a rogue of 17th level or higher could flank a 7th-level rogue/6th-level temple raider.
Skill Mastery			KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Skill Mastery					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:At 9th level, a temple raider becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, he selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, he may take 10 even if stress and distraction would normally prevent him from doing so.
Luck Domain				KEY:Temple Raider Of Olidammara ~ Luck Domain					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Temple Raider Of Olidammara Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:At 10th-level, the luck of Olidammara rubs off on a temple raider, granting the character access to the Luck domain. He may use the domain's granted power and adds the domain's spells to his temple raider spell list (but not any other spell lists he might have). If he already has the Luck domain, he can use its granted power one additional time per day.

###Block: Ur-Priest
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ur-Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:Ur-priests are profi- cient with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.
Spells per Day			KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ur-Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:An ur-priest gains the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast a spell, an ur-priest must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an ur-priest with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Ur-priest bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Wisdom modifier. When Table 2-23 indicates that the ur-priest gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, such as 0 2nd-level spells at 2nd level, the ur-priest gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ur-priest spell list is identical to the cleric spell list. An ur-priest has access to any spell on the list and prepares those spells as a cleric, except that he does not pray for spells, he just takes them. An ur-priest casts spells as a cleric does, except that unlike a cleric, he does not have the ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, nor does he have domain spells or associated domain granted powers. He does not have restrictions on spells with alignments. To determine the caster level of an ur-priest, add the character's ur-priest levels to one-half of his levels in other spellcasting classes. (Any levels gained in the cleric class by an ex-cleric don't count.)
Rebuke Undead			KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Rebuke Undead					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ur-Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:Like an evil cleric, an ur-priest of 2nd level or higher can rebuke undead. He uses his ur-priest level as the cleric level for determining success and damage (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the Player's Handbook).		ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Basic Turning|Rebuke Undead	BONUS:VAR|TurnLevelBase,TurnDamagePlusBase|UrPriestLVL	BONUS:VAR|TurnTimesBase|3+CHA|TYPE=Base	BONUS:VAR|TurnCheckBase|CHA|TYPE=Base
Divine Spell Resistance		KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Divine Spell Resistance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ur-Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:At 4th level, an ur-priest gains spell resistance 15, but only against divine spells and the spell-like abilities of outsiders. At 8th level, the urpriest's spell resistance increases to 20.
Siphon Spell Power		KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Siphon Spell Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ur-Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:Because they steal whatever power they can, ur-priests learn to manipulate their energy in ways that confound other casters. An ur-priest of 6th level or higher can temporarily sacrifice two (or more) lower-level spell slots and use those slots to prepare a higher-level spell. The higher-level spell must be of a level the ur-priest can cast. Only one exchange of this sort can be made each day. The levels of the lower-level slots are totaled, then reduced to three-quarters (round down) to determine the level of the extra higher-level spell slot. For example, an ur-priest who sacrifices a 3rd-level spell and a 5th-level spell can use that spell slot to prepare an additional 6th-level spell (3 + 5 = 8, and 8 x 3/4 = 6).
Steal Spell-Like Ability	KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Steal Spell-Like Ability			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ur-Priest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:The most powerful ur-priests can use the same techniques that siphon off the gods' spell power to steal the spell-like abilities of another creature. Once each day, when a creature with spell-like abilities is within 50 feet of a 10thlevel ur-priest, the ur-priest can choose one of the spell-like abilities of the creature to steal for himself. The ur-priest can use the spell-like ability as often as the creature can, or three times per day, whichever is less. The ur-priest uses the ability as the creature does with regard to caster level and save DCs. This ability only lasts 24 hours. The creature with the spell-like ability does not lose the ability when the urpriest steals it. If an ur-priest tries to steal a spell-like ability that the creature doesn't have, or tries to steal an ability that is supernatural rather than spell-like, the attempt automatically fails. For example, if an ur-priest is near a noble salamander, he can steal fireball and use it three times that day or steal dispel magic and use it once that day. If he is near a pit fiend, he could steal teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only) and use it three times per day, because the pit fiend can do it at will. He could even steal the pit fiend's wish ability, but because a pit fiend can only use wish once per year, the ur-priest would be similarly limited. He could not steal that power again from any creature for one year.

###Block: Void Disciple
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Void Disciple ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:Void disciples gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Void Disciple ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A void disciple continues her magical training while mastering the powers of void. At 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained one level in a previous spellcasting class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the character had more than one spellcasting class in which she could cast 3rd-level spells before becoming a void disciple, the player must decide to which class to add each void disciple level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Sense Void				KEY:Void Disciple ~ Sense Void					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:The first technique taught to the void disciple is the ability to reach out with the mind and sense the world around, exploring the unseen layer of reality most people rarely experience. The void disciple's consciousness actually departs her body and extends into the world, allowing her to use her normal senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell) to perceive whatever area, person, or thing she directs her attention to. The void disciple must make a Spellcraft check, with the DC determined by distance, not familiarity. A void disciple cannot sense across planar boundaries. Thus, a void disciple standing on one side of a gate could not extend her senses through it. With every four levels a void disciple attains beyond 1st, she gains the ability to perceive deeper levels of reality. At 5th level, a void disciple can use detect magic and detect evil at will. At 9th level, she can use discern lies and read emotional states, gaining a +10 bonus on Sense Motive checks. At 13th level, she can detect thoughts at will. A void disciple can use this ability once per day at 1st level. With every two levels she attains beyond 1st, she can use the ability an additional time per day (twice at 3rd level, three times at 5th, and so on). A void disciple can use this ability once per day at 1st level. With every two levels she attains beyond 1st, she can use the ability an additional time per day (twice at 3rd level, three times at 5th, and so on).
Moment of Clarity			KEY:Void Disciple ~ Moment of Clarity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:A void disciple of 4th level or higher can grant an ally the temporary ability to perform any skill or feat (with the exception of ancestor feats). The void disciple must use a s t a n d a r d a c t ion to touch the target. The target gains either one feat or a number of ranks in one skill equal to his relevant ability modifier for that skill. For example, a character with Dexterity 14 could gain 2 ranks in Ride, for a total skill modifier of +4. The effect lasts for 1 round per level of the void disciple. The void disciple can use this supernatural ability twice per day at 4th level, plus an additional use for every four additional levels she attains.
Altering the Course		KEY:Void Disciple ~ Altering the Course				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:Once per day, a void disciple of 7th level or higher can add a +20 bonus on any single attack roll, skill check, or ability check she makes. She cannot transfer this bonus to another character by any means. This supernatural ability requires no action, and lasts only the duration of the single check.
Void Release			KEY:Void Disciple ~ Void Release					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:Three times per day, a void disciple of 10th level or higher can touch an ally, allowing that character to use his highest ability score modifier in place of any one lower modifier (target's choice) for a number of rounds equal to half the void disciple's level. For example, a severely wounded fighter could use his high Strength modifier in place of his low Dexterity modifier for a few rounds, increasing his Armor Class, Reflex save bonus, and ranged attack bonus (as well as Dexteritybased skills).
Void Suppression			KEY:Void Disciple ~ Void Suppression				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:Once per day, a void disciple of 12th level or higher can make a melee touch attack to force the target to use his lowest ability score modifier in place of any one higher modifier (void disciple's choice) for 5 rounds. For example, a void disciple could force an ogre to use his low Intelligence modifier in place of his high Strength modifier, severely weakening the brute's physical blows.
Void Strike				KEY:Void Disciple ~ Void Strike					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Void Disciple Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:Once per day, a 13thlevel void disc iple can make a melee touch attack to bestow 1d4 negative levels on the target. The void disciple gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level she bestows. If the target has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature a -1 competence penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his highest available level. Negative levels stack. Assuming the target survives, he regains lost levels after 13 hours pass. This ability relies on the void disciple's mastery of void, not negative energy, so it cannot be used to benefit undead.

###Block: Warpriest

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Warpriest ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:A warpriest continues advancing in divine spellcasting ability. When a warpriest gains a new even-numbered level, the character gains new divine spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, more frequent remove disease, and so on). For example, an 8th-level cleric/2nd-level warpriest gains divine spells per day as if he had risen to 9th level as a cleric. When he next gains a level as a warpriest, making him an 8th-level cleric/3rd-level warpriest, his number of divine spells per day does not change; but when he improves his warpriest level to 4th, he gains divine spells per day as if he had risen to 10th level as a cleric. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a warpriest, the player must decide which class to assign each even-numbered level of warpriest for the purpose of determining divine spells per day and spells known.
Bonus Domain			KEY:Warpriest ~ Bonus Domain					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 1st level, a warpriest gains the Glory domain (if he turns undead) or the Domination domain (if he rebukes undead).

All who can hear the warpriest gain a morale bonus on saving throws against any charm or fear effect. The bonus begins at +2 for a 2ndlevel warpriest and increases by +2 at each even-numbered level thereafter (+4 at 4th level, +6 at 6th level, and so on). This effect lasts for 5 minutes after the speech ends, plus 1 minute per level of the warpriest. The warpriest also gains the bonus.
Mass Cure Light Wounds		KEY:Warpriest ~ Mass Cure Light Wounds			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a warpriest can use mass cure light wounds once per day as a spell-like ability.

Implacable Foe			KEY:Warpriest ~ Implacable Foe				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 10th level, a warpriest can channel positive (or negative) energy to keep allies fighting even after suffering mortal wounds. Activating this ability requires only a move action, but the warpriest must concentrate to maintain it each round after that. While active, the warpriest emanates an aura with a 100- foot radius. Allies within the radius may ignore the effects of being reduced to 0 or less hp. However, any creature reduced to -20 hp dies immediately. When the effect ends, or if a creature moves more than 100 feet from the warpriest, the normal effects of the damage apply immediately. If the warpriest normally turns undead, this ability affects living allies. If the warpriest normally rebukes undead, this ability affects undead allies.
