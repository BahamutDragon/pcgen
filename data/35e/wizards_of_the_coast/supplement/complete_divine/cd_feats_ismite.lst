Improved Smiting			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			VISIBLE:YES	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Smite Evil																																																																																					PRESTAT:1,CHA=13																										DESC:Your smite attacks deal more damage to specific foes, and can damage creatures with alignment-based damage reduction.																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.82													BENEFIT:Whenever you make a smite attack, your attack overcomes damage reduction as if had an alignment, and you deal an extra +1d6 points of damage to targets of a specific alignment. If the smite attack has an alignment associated with it, it deals its extra damage to foes of that alignment and it is treated as having the opposite alignment for overcoming damage reduction. For example, a paladin's smite evil attacks are treated as having the good alignment and deal +1d6 damage to evil targets, while a blackguard's smite good attacks are treated as having the evil alignment and deal +1d6 damage to good targets. If the smite attack has no alignment associated with it, you must choose an alignment component (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you select the feat. Your smite attacks overcome damage reduction as if they had that alignment, and deal +1d6 points of damage to foes of the opposite alignment. For example, a lawful neutral cleric of St. Cuthbert with the Destruction domain who selected this feat must choose for his smite attacks to be lawfully aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets). A lawful evil cleric of Hextor with the Destruction domain could choose to have his smite attacks be lawfully or evilly aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets or to good targets, respectively). You can't choose an alignment component that isn't part of your alignment, and once this choice is made, it can never be changed. If you later change alignment so that the chosen alignment component is no longer part of your alignment, you lose the benefits of this feat.
