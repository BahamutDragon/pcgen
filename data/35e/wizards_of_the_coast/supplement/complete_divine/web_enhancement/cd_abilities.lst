Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Dweomerkeeper ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dweomerkeeper Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:Dweomerkeepers gain no proficiency with any weapon, armor, or shield.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Dweomerkeeper ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dweomerkeeper Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:When a new level of dweomerkeeper is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). The level of dweomerkeeper is added to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then spells per day, spells known, and caster level are determined accordingly. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a dweomerkeeper, the player must decide to which class to add each level of dweomerkeeper for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Mantle of Spells			KEY:Dweomerkeeper ~ Mantle of Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dweomerkeeper Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:At 1st level, a dweomerkeeper creates a personal mantle of arcane and/or divine spells. She chooses one arcane or divine spell that she can cast, and thereafter she can convert prepared spells of that spell's type (arcane or divine) into the chosen spell, so long as the level of the spell to be converted is equal to or greater than that of the chosen spell. This ability functions just like a good cleric's ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into cure spells. At every odd-numbered dweomerkeeper level after 1st, the character chooses another spell to add to her mantle.
Arcane Sight			KEY:Dweomerkeeper ~ Arcane Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dweomerkeeper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:Upon attaining 2nd level, a dweomerkeeper can use arcane sight at will. This ability functions like the spell of the same name, except that its duration is concentration.
Supernatural Spell		KEY:Dweomerkeeper ~ Supernatural Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dweomerkeeper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:At 4th level, the dweomerkeeper is so attuned to the fabric of magic that she can manifest spell effects with almost no effort whatsoever. Once per day as a standard action, she can use any one spell with a casting time of up to 1 standard action as a supernatural ability. The spell chosen must be one that is currently available to the dweomerkeeper (that is, one that she has prepared or that she knows and has a spell slot of the appropriate level available to cast), but she can decide at the moment of casting to use this ability. The spell functions as it normally would and is expended normally, but the dweomerkeeper does not require any components, does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and ignores the target's spell resistance, just as if she were using a supernatural ability instead of a spell. At every even-numbered level after the 4th, the dweomerkeeper gains one additional use of this ability per day.
Cloak of Mysteries		KEY:Dweomerkeeper ~ Cloak of Mysteries			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dweomerkeeper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.2	DESC:At 10th level, a dweomerkeeper is wrapped in a mantle of ever-flowing magic, and all metamagic feats that she currently knows or learns in the future become easier to use. The spell level increase for applying a metamagic feat to any spell drops by 1 (minimum +1 level, or +0 level if the feat already has a +0 level adjustment). For example, a quickened fireball uses a 6th-level slot (+3 levels) instead of the usual 7th-level slot (+4 levels), but a silent fireball still uses a 4th-level slot (+1 level). A spell affected by the Heighten Spell feat is unaffected by this ability.

###Block: Master of Shrouds
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:Masters of shrouds are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:When an evennumbered level of master of shrouds is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he belonged before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, or the like). The level of master of shrouds is added to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class the character has, then spells per day, spells known, and caster level are determined accordingly. If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a master of shrouds, the player must decide to which class to add each level of master of shrouds for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Summon Undead			KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Summon Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:At 1st level, the master of shrouds gains the ability to summon a shadow or allip to fight his enemies. This ability works like the summon monster I spell, except as follows. The master of shrouds cannot dismiss the summoned creature, and if it remains after the last enemy is gone or slain, it attacks the master of shrouds unless he successfully rebukes or commands it. The master of shrouds gains a +4 bonus on turning checks and damage against undead he has summoned. As the master of shrouds gains additional levels in the prestige class, he can summon undead more frequently, and he gains access to more powerful incorporeal undead. He can summon two allips or two shadows at 3rd level, two wraiths at 5th level, two spectres at 7th level, or two greater shadows at 9th level. He may always choose to substitute lower-CR undead for any higher-CR ones that he can summon, but the number summoned does not change.
Extra Turning			KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Extra Turning				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.4	DESC:The master of shrouds gains Extra Turning as a bonus feat. Furthermore, his master of shrouds levels stack with his levels in any other classes that can rebuke or destroy undead (such as cleric) for the purpose of determining the parameters of his rebuke or command ability

###Block: Moon Guardian
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Moon Guardian ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Moon Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:Moon guardians gain no proficiency with any weapon, armor, or shield.
Natural Spell			KEY:Moon Guardian ~ Natural Spell				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Moon Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:At 1st level, the moon guardian gains Natural Spell as a bonus feat if he did not already have it.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Moon Guardian ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Moon Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:When an evennumbered level of moon guardian is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class granted him access to 3rd-level spells before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on). The level of moon guardian is added to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting class granted the character access to 3rd-level spells, then spells per day, spells known, and caster level are determined accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class that granted access to 3rd-level spells before he became a moon guardian, the player must decide to which class to add each level of moon guardian for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Voluntary Change			KEY:Moon Guardian ~ Voluntary Change				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Moon Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:At 1st level, the moon guardian receives the blessing of a deity of the moon. Unlike other afflicted lycanthropes, he can voluntarily change into animal or hybrid form without immediately and permanently changing alignment to that of his lycanthrope kind. The moon guardian is still subject to involuntary transformation under the full moon and whenever he takes damage in combat, but a failed Control Shape check under those circumstances doesn't change the character's alignment. Furthermore, a moon guardian who fails a Control Shape check to resume humanoid form can make another attempt each subsequent round, rather than waiting until dawn.
Rapid Change			KEY:Moon Guardian ~ Rapid Change				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Moon Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:At 3rd level, the moon guardian can make a Control Shape check as a move action rather than a standard action, though he can still change form only once per round.
Instantaneous Change		KEY:Moon Guardian ~ Instantaneous Change			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Moon Guardian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.6	DESC:At 5th level, the moon guardian can make a Control Shape check as a free action. Furthermore, he can do so in response to another's action, even if it isn't his turn yet. He can still change form only once per round.

###Block: Nightcloak
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Nightcloak ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Nightcloaks gain no proficiency with any weapon, armor, or shield.
Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Nightcloak ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:When a new level of nightcloak is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she belonged before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). The level of nightcloak is added to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then spells per day, spells known, and caster level are determined accordingly. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a nightcloak, the player must decide to which class to add each level of nightcloak for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Might of Darkness			KEY:Nightcloak ~ Might of Darkness				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 1st level, a nightcloak casts any spell with the darkness descriptor at +2 caster level.
Eyes of Night			KEY:Nightcloak ~ Eyes of Night				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:When the nightcloak reaches 2nd level, her eyes become totally black, granting her darkvision to a 60-foot range. She can also see through magical darkness to a range of 10 feet with the same black-and-white vision that darkvision provides. The nightcloak also cannot be blinded by magical effects.
Shadow Talk				KEY:Nightcloak ~ Shadow Talk					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:At 4th level, a nightcloak gains the ability to communicate mystically through the shadows of the mind. As a free action, she can whisper short messages to other worshipers of her patron deity, and each such creature within 500 feet hears the message as a whisper in its mind. Observers can also hear the words if they are close enough to hear the nightcloak's actual whispers (a DC 15 Listen check if the listener is within 10 feet of the nightcloak, +1 per 5 feet beyond that). Shadow talk is a sonic, languagedependent effect.
True Lies				KEY:Nightcloak ~ True Lies					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, a nightcloak can reach into a creature's mind and modify its memories as if using the 4th-level bard spell modify memory (caster level equals nightcloak's character level; save DC 10 + 1/2 nightcloak's character level + nightcloak's Charisma modifier). This ability is usable once per day.
Grace of the Dark			KEY:Nightcloak ~ Grace of the Dark				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Beginning at 7th level, the nightcloak can use the power of her mind to protect herself. She adds her Intelligence bonus (if any) to all saving throws.
Minions of Night			KEY:Nightcloak ~ Minions of Night				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	DESC:Once per week as a standard action, an 8th-level or higher nightcloak can summon one shadow per nightcloak level she possesses. The summoned shadows do her bidding for a number of rounds equal to her nightcloak level. Any shadows they create by draining Strength are likewise under the control of the nightcloak, but they vanish along with the originals when the duration of the effect expires. The nightcloak can verbally communicate with the shadows as if she knew their language or use her shadow talk ability to communicate with them.
Voice of Ineffable Evil		KEY:Nightcloak ~ Voice of Ineffable Evil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Nightcloak Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.10	DESC:At 10th level, a nightcloak can command a creature as though using the dominate monster spell (caster level equals nightcloak's character level). This ability is usable once per day and lasts for 24 hours unless ended earlier. Unlike most spelllike abilities, voice of ineffable evil has a verbal component.
