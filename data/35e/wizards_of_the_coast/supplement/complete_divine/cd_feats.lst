Arcane Disciple			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			VISIBLE:YES																PREALIGN:Deity											PREDEITY:1,Y											PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (Religion)=4,Spellcraft=4																																								PRESPELLCAST:TYPE=Arcane																													DESC:You learn to cast the spells associated with one of your deity's domains as arcane spells.												MULT:YES	CHOOSE:DOMAIN|DEITY																																						BONUS:DOMAIN|NUMBER|1												SOURCEPAGE:p.79													BENEFIT:Add the chosen domain's spells to your class list of arcane spells. If you have arcane spellcasting ability from more than one class, you must pick which arcane spellcasting ability this feat applies to. Once chosen, this decision cannot be changed for that feat. You may learn these spells as normal for your class; however, you use Wisdom (rather than the normal ability for your spellcasting) when determining the save DC for the spell. In addition, you must have a Wisdom score equal to 10 + the spell's level in order to prepare or cast a spell gained from this feat. Each day, you may prepare (or cast, if you cast spells without preparation) a maximum of one of these domains spells of each level.
Augment Healing			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			VISIBLE:YES																																										PRESKILL:1,Heal=4																																																																														DESC:Healing spells restore +2 per spell level.

SOURCEPAGE:p.79													BENEFIT:If your hit points are reduced to 0 or less (but you aren't killed), you can spend one wild shape as a free action (even if it isn't your turn) to continue acting as if not disabled or dying.

Consecrate Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic			VISIBLE:YES																PREALIGN:LG,NG,CG																																																																																																								DESC:You can imbue your spells with the raw energy of good.																																									ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.79													BENEFIT:A spell you modify with this feat gains the good descriptor. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage (rounded down) results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to be reduced by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. For example, a consecrated fire storm spell cast by a 16th-level cleric deals 16d6 points of damage, half of which is fire damage and half of which is sheer divine power. Thus, creatures immune to fire still take damage. The consecrated spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Corrupt Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic			VISIBLE:YES																PREALIGN:LE,NE,CE																																																																																																								DESC:You can transform one of your spells into an evil version of itself.																																						ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.79													BENEFIT:A spell you modify with this feat gains the evil descriptor. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage (rounded down) results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to be reduced by resistance or immunity to energy-based attacks. The corrupted spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

MULT:YES	CHOOSE:FEAT|TYPE=Metamagic																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.80													BENEFIT:When you take this feat, choose a metamagic feat that you know. This feat applies only to that metamagic feat. As a free action, you can take the energy from turning or rebuking undead and use it to apply a metamagic feat to divine spells that you know. You must spend one turn or rebuke attempt, plus an additional attempt for each level increase in the metamagic feat you're using. For example, Jozan the cleric could sacrifice three turn attempts to empower a holy smite he's casting. Because you're using positive or negative energy to augment your spells, the spell slot for the spell doesn't change.

SOURCEPAGE:p.81													BENEFIT:Once per round, you can spend a turn attempt as a free action when making a melee attack. If you successfully strike a creature that you could turn with that turn attempt because of its elemental subtype, you may add a bonus on your damage roll equal to your cleric level. If your attack misses, the turn attempt is lost to no effect.
Empower Turning			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			VISIBLE:YES	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Turn Undead,Rebuke Undead																																																																																																															DESC:You can turn or rebuke more undead with a single turning attempt.																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.81													BENEFIT:You can turn or rebuke more undead than usual. After adding your cleric level and Charisma modifier to your turning damage roll multiply it by 1.5.

Glorious Weapons			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine				VISIBLE:YES	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Turn Undead,Rebuke Undead																																																																																																															DESC:You can channel positive or negative energy to imbue your allies weapons with an alignment.																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.82													BENEFIT:You can spend a turn or rebuke attempt as standard action to align the melee weapons (including natural weapons) of all allies within a 60-ft. burst as good (if you channel positive energy) or evil (if you channel negative energy). Such weapons can overcome damage reduction as if they had the appropriate alignment. The effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
Grizzly's Claws			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Wild				VISIBLE:YES	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Wild Shape																																																																																																																	DESC:You can grow claws as sharp as those of a bear.																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.82													BENEFIT:You can spend one wild shape to gain two primary claw attacks (both at your base attack bonus and adding your Strength bonus).

Improved Smiting			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			VISIBLE:YES	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Smite Evil																																																																																					PRESTAT:1,CHA=13																										DESC:Your smite attacks deal more damage to specific foes, and can damage creatures with alignment-based damage reduction.																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.82													BENEFIT:Whenever you make a smite attack, your attack overcomes damage reduction as if had an alignment, and you deal an extra +1d6 points of damage to targets of a specific alignment. If the smite attack has an alignment associated with it, it deals its extra damage to foes of that alignment and it is treated as having the opposite alignment for overcoming damage reduction. For example, a paladin's smite evil attacks are treated as having the good alignment and deal +1d6 damage to evil targets, while a blackguard's smite good attacks are treated as having the evil alignment and deal +1d6 damage to good targets. If the smite attack has no alignment associated with it, you must choose an alignment component (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you select the feat. Your smite attacks overcome damage reduction as if they had that alignment, and deal +1d6 points of damage to foes of the opposite alignment. For example, a lawful neutral cleric of St. Cuthbert with the Destruction domain who selected this feat must choose for his smite attacks to be lawfully aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets). A lawful evil cleric of Hextor with the Destruction domain could choose to have his smite attacks be lawfully or evilly aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets or to good targets, respectively). You can't choose an alignment component that isn't part of your alignment, and once this choice is made, it can never be changed. If you later change alignment so that the chosen alignment component is no longer part of your alignment, you lose the benefits of this feat.

This benefit can't increase your caster level to higher than your Hit Dice. However, even if you can't benefit from the full bonus immediately, if you later gain Hit Dice in levels of non-spellcasting classes, you will be able to apply the rest of the bonus.
