If you have arcane spellcasting ability from more than one class, you must pick which arcane spellcasting ability this feat applies to. Once chosen, this decision cannot be changed for that feat.

In addition, you must have a Wisdom score equal to 10 + the spell's level in order to prepare or cast a spell gained from this feat. Each day, you may prepare (or cast, if you cast spells without preparation) a maximum of one of these domains spells of each level.

For example, a consecrated fire storm spell cast by a 16th-level cleric deals 16d6 points of damage, half of which is fire damage and half of which is sheer divine power. Thus, creatures immune to fire still take damage. The consecrated spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
