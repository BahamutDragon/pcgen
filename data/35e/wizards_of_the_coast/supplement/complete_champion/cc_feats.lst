At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, you gain a +5-foot sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus to your base f ly speed (maximum +20 feet at 20th level). Intangible, luminescent wings grow from your back when you activate hawk's f light and remain as long as the effect is active. Serpent's Strike: You gain a natural bite attack that deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage but no hit point damage. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) negates the Constitution damage. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect. Your upper canine teeth grow into fangs when you activate serpent's strike and remain in that form as long as the effect is active. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.

Awesome Smite				TYPE:Tactical					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Smite																PREFEAT:1,Power Attack																											PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Power Attack, base attack bonus +6, smite ability.											PRETOTALAB:6						DESC:Through a combination of sheer muscle and mystical acumen, you can deliver devastating smite attacks.													SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:This feat allows the use of three tactical maneuvers, each of which requires that you make a smite attack while using the Power Attack feat (minimum attack penalty -1). You must declare the use of this feat before making the attack roll. You can employ only one of these maneuvers at a time. Demolishing Smite: Your smite attack punches through your enemy's defenses. For the purpose of this single attack, you can ignore a number of points of damage reduction (except DR/� or DR/epic) up to twice your Charisma bonus (if any). For instance, if your Charisma is 17 (+3 bonus), you ignore 6 points of your target's damage reduction when making a demolishing smite. Overwhelming Smite: Your smite attack can knock an opponent prone. If the attack hits and deals damage, it is treated as though it were also a trip attack. Make a Strength check opposed by the defender's Strength or Dexterity, with all the normal trip modifiers (PH 158). A foe that resists is not entitled to make a trip attempt against you in return. You can attempt an overwhelming smite only once per round. Seeking Smite: Your smite attack is uncannily guided to its target. For the purpose of this single attack, you ignore any miss chance your foe might have, though your weapon must still be able to strike the target. Thus, while this maneuver allows you to strike an incorporeal creature unerringly with a magic sword, it does not allow you to strike it with a nonmagical weapon.
Battle Blessing				TYPE:General																																																											PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to cast paladin spells.																						DESC:You can cast spells more quickly than usual in the heat of battle.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.55	BENEFIT:You can cast most of your paladin spells faster than normal.

SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:This feat allows the use of three tactical maneuvers, each of which requires that you attempt a charge attack in the round immediately following your shift into animal form using wild shape. If you have the Swift Wild Shape feat (page 62), you can attempt the charge in the same round as you change forms. Pouncing Charge: You can make a full attack after you charge, as if you had the pounce ability (MM 313). If the animal form you have assumed normally has the pounce ability, your bonus on attack rolls when charging increases to +3. Striking Charge: For the purpose of this charge attack only, you gain an extra 5 feet of reach by suddenly striking forward with your head and neck. You must assume a serpentine animal form to employ this maneuver. Twisting Charge: You can change direction during a charge, as long as you move at least 10 feet both before and after you turn. You must assume an animal form with four or more legs to employ this maneuver. Normal: You can make only a single attack after charging, with a +2 bonus on attack rolls. You can charge only in a straight line.

SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can summon the force of chaos to aid you. When you activate this ability, roll 1d6. If the result is odd, add that number as a sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus on your attack rolls until your next action. If the result is even, add that number as a sacred or profane bonus to your AC. At the beginning of each action thereafter, roll the die again and apply the designated bonus. This effect lasts for 1 minute. When you attain 10th level, the die you roll increases to a d8. When you attain 15th level, the die increases to a d10. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.

DESC:Your close connection to death magic causes others to find your company unpleasant.																SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:As long as you have a 2nd-level or higher Death domain spell available to cast, you exude an almost imperceptible scent of the grave wherever you go. As a standard action, you can force one foe within 30 feet to attempt a Will save or be shaken for 1 minute. If you use this ability on an already shaken creature and it fails its saving throw, it becomes panicked for 1 minute or until it spends 1 full round out of line of sight of you. Creatures that succeed on this save are not affected again by your charnel miasma for 24 hours. As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting death spells.

Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Destruction Devotion			TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:Your attacks weaken your opponents' defenses.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:Once per day as an immediate action, you can call upon the forces of destruction to weaken your opponents' defenses. If you deal damage with a melee attack (but not a melee touch attack) while this ability is active, you temporarily reduce the struck opponent's armor bonus or natural armor bonus by 1. Reductions from multiple hits stack, to a minimum bonus of +0. If the opponent has both armor and natural armor bonuses, it chooses which one to reduce. Once one bonus reaches +0, the other bonus automatically gets reduced until it too reaches +0 or the effect ends. This effect lasts for 1 minute, after which all armor and natural armor bonuses reduced in this way return to normal. Upon reaching 10th level, you reduce your opponent's armor or natural armor bonus by 2 per successful hit. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Earth Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:You can manipulate the earth to your advantage.

If you use this ability to affect nearby terrain, you can change one 5-foot square of earth or stone from normal to difficult terrain for every three character levels you possess (minimum 1 square; maximum 6 squares at 18th level). The first square you change must be within 30 feet of you, and all other squares must be linked to that one in an unbroken line. Thus, the second square must be adjacent to the first, the third must be adjacent to the first or second, and so on. This change lasts for 1 minute. On attaining 10th level, you can cause stone spikes to grow from any surface you have changed to difficult terrain using this ability. These spikes work like caltrops (PH 126), except that the bonus on attack rolls for each spike equals your base attack bonus, and they cannot be swept away. This effect also lasts 1 minute. If you cause spikes to appear underneath a creature on the affected surface, they immediately "attack." Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.

SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:Once per day as an immediate action, you can surround yourself with an aura of evil that grants you and each of your allies within 30 feet damage reduction that can be overcome only by good-aligned weapons. The numeric value of this damage reduction is 1 + 1/five character levels you possess (maximum 5/good at 20th level). In addition, your and your allies' natural and weapon attacks are evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This effect lasts for 1 minute. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Fire Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:You can burn your enemies with your melee attacks.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can sheathe your body in red and orange flames. The fire does not harm you, but you illuminate the nearby area as a torch would.

You cannot, for example, use this ability to regain a previously cast wizard spell.
Spiritual Counter				TYPE:Divine						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Turn Undead,TYPE.Rebuke Undead												PREFEAT:1,TYPE.Divine																											PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Any other divine feat, ability to turn or rebuke undead.																		DESC:Your devotion and faith allow you to counter the effects of other spells.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:As a standard (readied) action, you can expend one or more turn or rebuke undead attempts to counter another caster's spell, as though you had cast the same spell yourself (see Counterspells, PH 170). You must spend a number of daily uses equal to 2+ the level of the spell you wish to counter (minimum 1) and be able to cast that spell as if it were on your spell list. Normal: You can counter a spell only by casting the same spell, a specific counterspell, or dispel magic.
Spontaneous Domains			TYPE:General																																																		PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=3,Divine=3				PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells, access to two or more cleric domains.											PREVARGTEQ:Count("Domain"),2	DESC:You need not prepare your domain spells in advance.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:When preparing your spells for the day, you can leave your domain slots open. You can then choose, when the situation arises, to cast any of the domain spells you could normally have prepared for a given level. However, you are still limited to one domain spell per level per day. Normal: Clerics must prepare their domain spells before casting.
Strength Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:You can overcome an opponent's normal resistance to damage.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can bypass hardness with your melee attacks for 1 minute. In addition, you gain a slam attack as a natural weapon, and all your melee attacks (natural or not) gain the adamantine property for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. As a natural weapon, your slam attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It deals damage based on your size and character level, as given on the following table. Character Level Damage (S) Damage (M) Damage (L) 1st-5th 1d4 1d6 1d8 6th-10th 1d6 1d8 2d6 11th-15th 1d8 1d10 2d8 16th-20th 1d10 2d6 3d6 If you already have a natural weapon, use whichever damage value is higher. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any damage rolls you make with that weapon. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Sun Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:Your weapon blazes with the power of the sun.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can cause one of your melee weapons to glow with the power of the sun. The illumination radius is the same as that of a torch, but the light is true sunlight and affects creatures within a 10-foot radius as such. This effect lasts for 1 minute. While your weapon glows, it deals an additional 1 point of sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) damage per character level you possess to any undead it strikes. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
Swift Call					TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Special Mount																																													PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Special mount class feature.																							DESC:You can call your special mount in the blink of an eye.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:You can call your special mount as a swift action. Normal: Calling a special mount is a full-round action.
Swift Wild Shape				TYPE:Wild						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Wild Shape																PREFEAT:1,Fast Wild Shape																							PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dex 13, Fast Wild ShapeCD, wild shape class feature.																			DESC:You can shift forms in the blink of an eye.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:You can activate your wild shape ability as a swift action. Normal: Activating wild shape is a standard action.
Touch of Healing				TYPE:Reserve																																																		PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=2,Divine=2				PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to cast 2nd-level spells.																						DESC:You can channel divine energy into healing with a touch.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:As long as you have a conjuration (healing) spell of 2nd level or higher available to cast, you can spend a standard action to touch a target creature and heal 3 points of damage per level of the highest-level conjuration (healing) spell you have available to cast. You can use this ability only on a target that has been reduced to one-half or fewer of its total hit points. The effect ends once you've healed the subject up to half its normal maximum hit points. This ability has no effect on creatures that can't be healed by cure spells. As a secondary benefit, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level when casting conjuration (healing) spells.
Travel Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:You can move quickly around the battlefield.																						SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:Once per day as a swift action, you can activate this ability to move up to your speed as a swift action each round. Thus, you can move your speed and then take a fullround action, or move and take two other actions (two move actions or one move action and one standard action). This effect lasts for 1 minute. Special: You cannot take a 5-foot step in the same round that you use this feat to move as a swift action. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each two daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Trickery Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:You project a simulacrum of yourself that can perform limited tasks.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action, you can create an exact duplicate of yourself up to 30 feet away. You can control this simulacrum's movements as a free action. The image becomes more "real" as you advance in level. This ability is usable up to a maximum of 1 minute per level each day. The simulacrum combines the characteristics of the silent image (PH 279) and unseen servant (PH 297) spells. Its hit points are equal to 6 + your character level. It ignores terrain effects and moves like an unseen servant, making no noise in the process, though it makes normal motions while traveling. If you have a fly speed, the image appears to fly when not in contact with the ground; otherwise, it walks on open air. You can do anything with this image that you could do with the unseen servant spell and are under the same limitations. When you attain 5th level, you gain more control over the simulacrum. At this point, it behaves more like a major image spell (PH 252), though it still performs actions like an unseen servant. As long as the simulacrum remains within 5 feet of your position (and you can direct it to do so as a free action), you can perform a Bluff check in combat as a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on this check, which is opposed by your opponents' Sense Motive checks. If you are successful, your foes believe the image is you (and vice versa) for 1 round. Once you reach 10th level, you can spend a swift action to transfer your perceptions to the simulacrum and perceive the world from its point of view rather than your own. You can move the image as if it were your own body, using the simulacrum's movement characteristics (ignoring terrain, "f lying," and the like). You can also perform any skill and ability checks using the simulacrum, as long as they do not require a Strength score higher than 2. The image has phantom versions of all your equipment (such as lockpicks), but any such items that lose direct contact with it immediately dissipate. When you attain 15th level, the image can become more "real" at your command. It gains a Strength score equal to one-half your own and can perform combat actions using phantom versions of your gear. Any of these items that lose contact with the image dissipate immediately. Thus, the image can wield a sword, but if it shoots a bow, the arrow disappears as soon as it is fired. Equipment that extends more than 5 feet from the image (such as a length of rope) also disappears beyond that distance. In addition, you can now cast spells originating from the image as if with a project image spell (PH 265), with one exception. If you lose line of effect to the image, the effect does not end; you just can't cast spells originating from the image until you gain line of effect again. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Umbral Shroud				TYPE:Reserve																																																		PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=3,Divine=3				PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.																						DESC:You control darkness and shadows.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:As long as you have a 3rd-level or higher darkness spell available to cast, shadows and darkness appear to obey your will. As a standard action, you can direct these shadows to obscure the vision of one foe within 30 feet. If your target fails a Will save, its attacks have a miss chance equal to 5%% per level of the highest-level darkness spell you have available to cast. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next action. Creatures that do not rely on sight are unaffected by this effect, and those with Blind-Fight or similar abilities can fight as they normally would. As a secondary benefit, you gain darkvision out to 10 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 10 feet.
Venom's Gift				TYPE:Wild						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Wild Shape Plant															PREFEAT:2,TYPE.Wild																											PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Any two wild feats, wild shape class feature, ability to assume plant form using wild shape.												DESC:You can imbue your natural attacks with a touch of venom.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can expend one daily use of your wild shape ability to envenom your natural attacks for up to 1 round per caster level you possess. An ordinary unarmed strike does not qualify for this benefit; you must have a true natural attack, though it can be the result of a transmutation spell or other shapechange effect. Poison: Injury, Fortitude negates (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifier), 1d2 Str/1d2 Str.
War Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:You can control your abilities more effectively in combat.																				SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:Once per day, when fighting defensively as a standard or full-round action, you take a -3 penalty on all attack rolls in a round and gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC in the same round. When you attain 7th level, your penalty on attack rolls drops to -2 and your dodge bonus increases to +4. When you attain 15th level, your penalty on attack rolls drops to -1 and your dodge bonus increases to +5. This bonus stacks with the bonus to AC granted by the Combat Expertise feat. This benefit is an extraordinary ability. Normal: When fighting defensively, you take a -4 penalty on all attacks in a round and gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round. Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each three daily turn or rebuke uses you expend.
Water Devotion				TYPE:Domain																																																																																											DESC:You can create a water guardian.																								SOURCEPAGE:p.64	BENEFIT:Once per day as a standard action, you can pour the contents of a full waterskin on the ground and summon forth a water elemental on that spot. The creature remains and follows your commands for 1 minute. The size of the elemental is based on your character level, as given in the table below. Character Water Elemental Level Summoned 1st-5th Small 6th-10th Medium 11th-15th Large 16th-20th Huge Special: You can select this feat multiple times, gaining one additional daily use each time you take it. Special: If you have the ability to turn or rebuke undead, you gain one additional daily use of this feat for each daily turn or rebuke use you expend.
