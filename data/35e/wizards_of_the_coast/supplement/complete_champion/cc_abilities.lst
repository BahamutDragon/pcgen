This creature is both invisible and intangible, but it provides you with real benefits. The divine companion stores arcane energy and redirects it to you according to your level and your needs. To fill this reservoir, you must cast one or more targeted spells at this creature. A spell so cast does not produce its normal effect; the companion simply absorbs the spells energy. It can store a number of spell levels equal to your arcane caster level. You can cast spells into it at any time, but after you rest and recover your spell slots for the day, the divine companion loses any stored energy. The divine companion exists outside reality and cannot be affected by spells, spell-like abilities, or any sort of antimagic effect or dispel check. It cannot, however, release its arcane energy within an antimagic field or similar effect. It uses your caster level for any checks required, and when it releases arcane energy, the level of the effect created equals the number of spell levels released. The divine companion can release its stored spell energy in either of the following ways, at your command. You can use each effect as often as you wish, until the companions stored energy is depleted. Healing (Su): As a standard action, you can order your divine companion to convert the energy it has stored into healing power. This is the equivalent of a conjuration (healing) spell. This effect heals you for 1d6 points of damage per stored spell level, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). Shielding (Su): As a swift action, you can order the creature to convert the energy it has stored into protecting you.

# Cleric
Pool of Healing			KEY:Cleric ACF ~ Pool of Healing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Replaces: To select this class feature, you must permanently sacrifice one of your 4th-level spell slots. Benefit: You establish a pool of positive energy that you can use to heal yourself or others. This pool contains enough positive energy to heal an amount of damage equal to 5  (1 + your divine caster level) hit points per day. You can dole it out with a touch, expending as much or as little of the pool at a time as you wish in much the same way as a paladin does with her lay on hands ability. The pool automatically replenishes every time you prepare spells for the day. You can also deal out this positive energy with a melee touch attack against any creature vulnerable to positive energy (such as undead), damaging it as if you had cast a cure spell upon it. Example: Jozan, a 7th-level cleric of Pelor, gives up one of his 4th-level spell slots to set up his pool of healing. Every day, he can heal up to 5  (1 + 7) = 40 points of damage, or deal that amount of damage to creatures powered by negative energy, or use the energy for a combination of those effects, up to the maximum available.

# Sorcerer
Divine Companion			KEY:Sorcerer ACF ~ Divine Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Replaces: This benefit replaces the summon familiar class feature. Benefit: You can spend 100 gp to perform a ritual dedicated to the deity of your choice and summon forth a spirit creature to aid you in your adventures. This creature is both invisible and intangible, but it provides you with real benefits. The divine companion stores arcane energy and redirects it to you according to your level and your needs. To fill this reservoir, you must cast one or more targeted spells at this creature. A spell so cast does not produce its normal effect; the companion simply absorbs the spells energy. It can store a number of spell levels equal to your arcane caster level. You can cast spells into it at any time, but after you rest and recover your spell slots for the day, the divine companion loses any stored energy. The divine companion exists outside reality and cannot be affected by spells, spell-like abilities, or any sort of antimagic effect or dispel check. It cannot, however, release its arcane energy within an antimagic field or similar effect. It uses your caster level for any checks required, and when it releases arcane energy, the level of the effect created equals the number of spell levels released. The divine companion can release its stored spell energy in either of the following ways, at your command. You can use each effect as often as you wish, until the companions stored energy is depleted. Healing (Su): As a standard action, you can order your divine companion to convert the energy it has stored into healing power. This is the equivalent of a conjuration (healing) spell. This effect heals you for 1d6 points of damage per stored spell level, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). Shielding (Su): As a swift action, you can order the creature to convert the energy it has stored into protecting you. This is the equivalent of an abjuration spell that provides you with a defl ection bonus to AC and a resistance bonus on saves each equal to the number of stored spell levels, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). This effect lasts for 1 round per arcane caster level you possess.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.51
