This creature is both invisible and intangible, but it provides you with real benefits. The divine companion stores arcane energy and redirects it to you according to your level and your needs. To fill this reservoir, you must cast one or more targeted spells at this creature. A spell so cast does not produce its normal effect; the companion simply absorbs the spell's energy. It can store a number of spell levels equal to your arcane caster level. You can cast spells into it at any time, but after you rest and recover your spell slots for the day, the divine companion loses any stored energy. The divine companion exists outside reality and cannot be affected by spells, spell-like abilities, or any sort of antimagic effect or dispel check. It cannot, however, release its arcane energy within an antimagic field or similar effect. It uses your caster level for any checks required, and when it releases arcane energy, the level of the effect created equals the number of spell levels released. The divine companion can release its stored spell energy in either of the following ways, at your command. You can use each effect as often as you wish, until the companion's stored energy is depleted. Healing (Su): As a standard action, you can order your divine companion to convert the energy it has stored into healing power. This is the equivalent of a conjuration (healing) spell. This effect heals you for 1d6 points of damage per stored spell level, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). Shielding (Su): As a swift action, you can order the creature to convert the energy it has stored into protecting you.

Pool of Healing			KEY:Cleric ACF ~ Pool of Healing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Replaces: To select this class feature, you must permanently sacrifice one of your 4th-level spell slots. Benefit: You establish a pool of positive energy that you can use to heal yourself or others. This pool contains enough positive energy to heal an amount of damage equal to 5 x (1 + your divine caster level) hit points per day. You can dole it out with a touch, expending as much or as little of the pool at a time as you wish in much the same way as a paladin does with her lay on hands ability. The pool automatically replenishes every time you prepare spells for the day. You can also deal out this positive energy with a melee touch attack against any creature vulnerable to positive energy (such as undead), damaging it as if you had cast a cure spell upon it. Example: Jozan, a 7th-level cleric of Pelor, gives up one of his 4th-level spell slots to set up his pool of healing. Every day, he can heal up to 5 x (1 + 7) = 40 points of damage, or deal that amount of damage to creatures powered by negative energy, or use the energy for a combination of those effects, up to the maximum available. At 10th level, he can heal up to 55 points of damage using this ability. Pool of healing is a spell-like ability.

This effect lasts until you choose to end it or change it (as a free action) to the other alignment component, or until you no longer wield the weapon.

At 5th level, your base speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks.

If you already had low-light vision, you instead gain darkvision out to 60 feet while underground; if you already had darkvision, add 30 feet to its range. At 7th level, you can use spike stones once per day, as the spell (caster level equals your paladin level). At 12th level, you gain the earth glide extraordinary ability, which enables you to move through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish moves through water (MM 98). If you end your movement inside earth or stone, however, you begin to suffocate (DMG 304).

# Rogue
Antiquarian				KEY:Rogue ACF ~ Antiquarian			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Replaces: This benefit replaces the trapfinding class feature. Benefit: When examining divine items and religious relics, you gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on all Appraise checks as an extraordinary ability. In addition, if you examine a magic item created using a spell from the cleric or paladin list, or an item with special religious significance, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check (DC 10 + the item's caster level) to identify it exactly as a spell-like ability. This works like the identify spell (caster level equals your rogue level) but requires no material component. You can use this ability on only one item per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Death's Ruin			KEY:Rogue ACF ~ Death's Ruin			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Replaces: This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature, including trap sense bonuses gained at higher levels of the rogue class. Benefit: You can make sneak attacks against undead creatures. However, you roll only one-half your normal sneak attack dice (rounded down) when determining bonus damage for such attacks. This is a supernatural ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.51
# Sorcerer
Divine Companion			KEY:Sorcerer ACF ~ Divine Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Replaces: This benefit replaces the summon familiar class feature. Benefit: You can spend 100 gp to perform a ritual dedicated to the deity of your choice and summon forth a spirit creature to aid you in your adventures. This creature is both invisible and intangible, but it provides you with real benefits. The divine companion stores arcane energy and redirects it to you according to your level and your needs. To fill this reservoir, you must cast one or more targeted spells at this creature. A spell so cast does not produce its normal effect; the companion simply absorbs the spell's energy. It can store a number of spell levels equal to your arcane caster level. You can cast spells into it at any time, but after you rest and recover your spell slots for the day, the divine companion loses any stored energy. The divine companion exists outside reality and cannot be affected by spells, spell-like abilities, or any sort of antimagic effect or dispel check. It cannot, however, release its arcane energy within an antimagic field or similar effect. It uses your caster level for any checks required, and when it releases arcane energy, the level of the effect created equals the number of spell levels released. The divine companion can release its stored spell energy in either of the following ways, at your command. You can use each effect as often as you wish, until the companion's stored energy is depleted. Healing (Su): As a standard action, you can order your divine companion to convert the energy it has stored into healing power. This is the equivalent of a conjuration (healing) spell. This effect heals you for 1d6 points of damage per stored spell level, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). Shielding (Su): As a swift action, you can order the creature to convert the energy it has stored into protecting you. This is the equivalent of an abjuration spell that provides you with a defl ection bonus to AC and a resistance bonus on saves each equal to the number of stored spell levels, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). This effect lasts for 1 round per arcane caster level you possess.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Domain Access			KEY:Sorcerer ACF ~ Domain Access		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sorcerer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Replaces: To gain this benefit, you do not learn a new 1st-level sorcerer spell and a new 2nd-level sorcerer spell at 5th level. From now on, you know one less sorcerer spell that you can cast at each subsequent level (not counting the domain spells from this alternative class feature). Benefit: Choose one cleric domain. If you worship a specific deity, the domain you choose must be one to which your deity grants access. You gain the granted power of the chosen domain. In addition, you can cast one domain spell of each spell level available to you per day from that domain.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.52
# Wizard
Spontaneous Divination		KEY:Wizard ACF ~ Spontaneous Divination	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:You can use your connection to the divine to inquire about mysteries beyond mortal ken. Level: 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th. Replaces: This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a wizard at 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th level. Benefit: You can spontaneously cast any spell of the divination school by sacrificing a prepared spell of equal or greater level. For example, if you suddenly have need of the 2nd-level spell locate object, you can sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell (such as mirror image) or any prepared spell of a higher level to cast it on the spot.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.52
Domain Granted Power		KEY:Wizard ACF ~ Domain Granted Power	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																												DESC:Choose one cleric domain. If you worship a specific deity, the domain you choose must be one to which your deity grants access. You now can use that domain's granted power as a cleric does, but you do not gain access to its spells or extra spell slots. Special: If you take levels in a class that grants you a domain choice (such as cleric), you gain the full benefits of the domain in addition to the other domains available to you from that class.
