###Block: Spell Descriptions
# Spell Name			Description
Aligned Aura.MOD			DESC:A rush of divine energy flows through your holy symbol, infusing your body with the essence of the divine ethos. When you cast this spell, choose one non-neutral aspect of your own alignment-chaos, evil, good, or law. (If you are neutral, you can select whichever alignment you wish each time you cast this spell.) You are immediately surrounded in a 20-foot aura of invisible energy associated with the chosen alignment component. Anyone in that area who shares that alignment component gains a bonus, and anyone with the opposed alignment component must make a Fortitude save or take a penalty. The values of these.MODifiers and the features to which they apply are given on the following table. These.MODifiers end when the affected creature leaves the spell's area. Alignment Bonus Penalty Chaos +1 on attack rolls -1 on saving throws Evil +1 on damage rolls -1 to Armor Class Good +1 on saving throws -1 on attack rolls Law +1 to Armor Class -1 on damage rolls At any point before the duration expires, you can choose to unleash the spell's remaining power in a 60-foot burst that deals 1d4 points of damage per round of duration remaining (maximum 15d4) to each creature of the opposed alignment in the area. Each affected creature can attempt a Fortitude save for half damage. The burst also heals 1 point of damage per round of duration remaining (maximum 15 points) for each creature of the same alignment in the area. Once this option is invoked, the spell ends immediately.
Benediction.MOD			DESC:You grant your comrade the luck of the gods. With this spell, you can grant another creature a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the subject is also under another effect that grants saving throw bonuses, the effects stack. In addition, at any point before the duration expires, the subject can choose to reroll a single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check after seeing the result of the initial roll, but before finding out whether it succeeds or fails. The higher of the two rolls applies. Once this option is exercised, the spell ends immediately. Unlike most touch spells, benediction cannot be used on yourself. Its effects are for the benefit of others only.
Bewildering Mischance.MOD	DESC:Your deity's laughter rains down on your suddenly clumsy foe. Bewildering mischance causes extreme bad luck to befall the target. For the duration of the spell, the subject must roll each saving throw, attack roll, and skill check twice, keeping the lower of the two rolls.
Bewildering Substitution.MOD	DESC:You channel the mockery of the trickster deities to sow dissension among your opponents. By casting this spell, you cause the subject to believe that one ally and one enemy have traded places. The ally physically closest to the subject now seems to have the appearance, voice, clothing, and gear of its nearest enemy, and that enemy looks and sounds exactly like the subject's nearest ally. Both the ally and the enemy must be within the spell's range, and the effect ends immediately if either moves out of its range from you. The illusion affects only the subject.
Bewildering Visions.MOD		DESC:You channel mischievous divine energy to envelop your foe in sickened disorientation. This spell makes the world appear to be tossing and rippling in a nauseating manner. The subject is sickened for the duration of the spell and must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated. This saving through must be repeated each round.
Bleed.MOD				DESC:Your touch thins the blood of your target, causing it to spill with unnatural ease. For the duration of the spell, the subject bleeds profusely through any open wound. Each new hit from a piercing or slashing weapon or effect that deals damage to the subject also deals 1 point of Constitution damage. This ability damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. Because this spell thins the subject's blood, repeated uses cause additional difficulty. In addition to the extra damage, a target subjected to a second use of this spell before the first has expired also takes a -4 penalty on Fortitude saves against disease, poison, or the sickened and nauseated conditions. Creatures with no discernible anatomy (such as plants and oozes) and those immune to critical hits (such as undead and constructs) are immune to this spell.
Body Ward.MOD			DESC:Your comrade's body grows denser and stronger beneath your touch. You grant the subject a limited resistance to ability damage. You choose one of the three physical ability scores-Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution-when you cast the spell. Body ward absorbs the next 5 points of damage dealt to that ability score, regardless of its source. If, for instance, an ally you had warded against Strength damage were subsequently poisoned for 6 points of Strength damage, she would take only 1 point. The spell lasts until its duration expires, or until the 5 points of protection are used up, whichever comes first. When cast multiple times upon the same subject, body ward has a synergistic effect. If you use it to affect two physical abilities simultaneously, it wards each against 8 points of damage. If you use it to affect all three physical abilities at once, it wards each against 10 points of damage. To achieve this synergy, the multiple castings must occur in subsequent rounds. The benefits from multiple castings of body ward that protect the same ability score do not stack.
Bolster Aura.MOD			DESC:The divine aura that surrounds you begins to swell, sending off waves of faux power into the ether. By casting bolster aura, you make the aura of the target creature or object stronger, possibly causing other creatures to assume that the target is more powerful than it actually is. For every two caster levels you possess, the target of a bolster aura spell appears to have 1 Hit Die more than it actually does. If the target has no aura, then bolster aura has no effect.
Conduit of Life.MOD		DESC:A small kernel of positive energy grows within your heart, warming your whole body. The next time you use a class feature or racial ability to channel positive energy (such as turn undead or lay on hands), you also heal a number of points of damage to yourself equal to 2d10+1/caster level (maximum 10). If you are already subject to an ongoing healing effect (such as vigorSC), or if you receive a cure spell while conduit of life is still in effect, this spell instead heals a number of points of damage equal to 3d8+1/caster level and it is discharged.
Confound.MOD			DESC:Your opponent's eyes try to follow your gestures while you cast, and they fail to refocus when you finish. You render the target unable to follow your movements effectively. The subject takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls made against you, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made against it. If you worship a deity that provides access to the Trickery domain-even if you did not choose that domain-these.MODifiers rise to -3 and +3, respectively. Furthermore, the subject cannot make attacks of opportunity against you. If you successfully cast this spell on the same subject in each of 2 consecutive rounds, these beneficial effects extend to your allies as well.
Dampen Magic.MOD			DESC:You can sense the fibers of magic around you. Reaching out, you pull them tight about your subject, creating an invisible cocoon of mystical forces. This spell surrounds the subject with a mystical field that dampens the effects of magic. While it is in effect, the enhancement bonus of any magic weapon used against the subject is lowered by 1. For instance, a +4 longsword would have only a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when wielded against the subject. However, even if a weapon's enhancement bonus is reduced below +1, its masterwork bonus still applies. Similarly, every spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that affects the subject-whether it is specifically targeted on the subject or merely includes the subject in its area-takes a -1 penalty to caster level and save DC. The subject of the spell can choose, as a move action, to lower this field to receive the full effects of beneficial spells, but doing so might leave him vulnerable until his next turn, since raising the effect again also requires a move action. Ongoing magical effects already in place on the subject when dampen magic is cast (such as bull's strength or the enhancement bonuses of its own equipment) are unaffected, but any item the subject picks up and any spell he receives after dampen magic is in effect are affected as normal. For every six caster levels above 7th that you possess, the spell reduces incoming effects by one additional point. Thus, if your caster level is 13th-18th, the reduction to the enhancement bonus of weapons and the caster levels and save DCs of spells used against the subject is 2, and if your caster level is 19th or higher, the reduction is 3. At any time when dampen magic has 5 or more rounds of duration left, the subject can render itself utterly immune to most magic for a brief period. The effect produced is an antimagic field (PH 200), which surrounds the subject to a radius of 5 feet. Divide the remaining rounds of duration by 5 and round down; the result is the number of rounds the antimagic effect lasts. Once that time expires, the spell ends, and once the antimagic field has been invoked, the original spell effect cannot be reinstated.
Darts of Life.MOD			DESC:Small orbs of light circle your head. With a gesture, you cause one to spin off and strike your friend, healing him of damage. You create ten gently pulsing darts of pale blue light that orbit your head like ioun stones. As a free action, you can launch one dart per round at an ally you designate within range. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can launch up to three darts per round at one or more designated allies within range. As a full-round action, you can launch all remaining orbs at one or more allies within range. Each dart heals 1d8 points of damage the target has taken, as though it were a cure spell. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell damages them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance to this
Deific Bastion.MOD		DESC:Calling upon your patron for protection, you imbue your defenses with an unnatural resilience. You must either be holding a shield or wearing heavy armor to cast this spell. The shield or armor gains a +1 enhancement bonus plus an additional special ability that depends on your deity, as given on the table below. This enhancement bonus is defensive only; it does not cause a shield to function as a magic weapon if it is used to make a shield bash. The enhancement bonus of the armor or shield is +2 if your caster level is 9th-11th, +3 if it's 12th-14th level, +4 if it's 15th-16th, and +5 if it's 18th or higher.
Divine Presence.MOD		DESC:Your back straightens, your eyes flash, and your aura pulses with divine might. You channel a tiny spark of the divine, granting yourself nearly inhuman presence. You gain a +5 sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil) bonus on Intimidate checks made against anyone who does not worship your deity. When making such checks against individuals who have one alignment component opposed to yours (chaos/law or good/evil), this bonus becomes +10. When making such checks against someone whose alignment is diametrically opposed to yours, the bonus becomes +15.
Divine Retribution.MOD		DESC:You feel your deity's hand hovering over you, ready to smite anyone who harms you. For the duration of this spell, any creature that attacks you-whether with a physical attack, a spell, or by other means-is struck by a retributive effect immediately after you're affected. The retribution deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level you possess (maximum 15d6) and 1d4 points of ability damage. The precise nature of the damage and ability damage are depend upon your deity, as given in the table below, but the damage is always one-half energy and one-half divine power. A successful Will save halves the hit point damage and negates the ability damage. Once the retributive effect takes place, the spell ends. If you do not worship a deity, choose one whose alignment is within one step of your own. You must make this choice when you cast this spell for the first time and cannot subsequently change it, unless your alignment changes in such a way that your previous choice is no longer applicable. You can have only one divine retribution spell in effect at any time.
Door of Decay.MOD			DESC:You feel yourself pulled forward, into the undead creature you have touched. Your flesh and soul grow cold, and after an instant of maddening emptiness, you reappear elsewhere. You can use the Negative Energy Plane as a conduit in the same fashion that most teleportation magic uses the Astral Plane. Upon casting this spell, you can literally step into an undead creature and emerge from another designated undead creature up to 100 miles away per caster level. If you do not know the precise location of the destination undead, you can select the undead creature you control nearest your desired exit point. Both undead creatures must be your size category or larger and either willing or under your control. (Mindless undead are considered willing only if you control them.) If you worship Wee Jas, Vecna, or another deity associated with both death and magic, you gain a +4 bonus to your caster level for the purpose of determining the maximum distance you can travel. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load, but you cannot bring other creatures with you. Special: A dread necromancerHH can learn this spell through the advanced learning class feature, even though it is not a necromancy spell.
Execration.MOD			DESC:You channel the wrath of your deity through a simple touch, inflicting misfortune on your foe. With a touch, you impose a -2 penalty on all of another creature's saving throws. If the subject is also under another effect that imposes saving throw penalties, the effects stack. At any point before the spell's duration expires, you can force the subject to reroll a single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check as an immediate action. You can require this action either before or after the subject rolls, but you must have line of sight to the subject at the time. The lower of the two rolls applies. Once this option is exercised, the spell ends immediately.
Footsteps of the Divine.MOD	DESC:Your body twists and reshapes itself, allowing you brief freedom from the confines of a wholly humanoid shape. Upon casting this spell, you briefly acquire a new movement.MODe and speed, as given on the table below. Unlike most deity-variable spells, footsteps of the divine does not limit you to the option offered by your own deity; you are free to choose any option presented on the table. If you choose an option offered by a deity other than your own, however, the spell duration is halved. You can choose only one option per casting.  Your assumption of a new movement.MODe, if any, imposes certain physical changes on you. For instance, if footsteps of the divine grants you flight, you grow wings; if it grants you a burrow speed, you grow heavy digging claws; and so forth. A "-" entry indicates that you gain no new movement type, but your base speed increases by the amount indicated. At any point before the duration expires, you can choose to employ a burst of truly inhuman speed. Doing so adds an additional +10 feet to your speed per round remaining in the spell's duration. However, this effect lasts for only a single round, after which the spell ends.
Forest Child.MOD			DESC:The tree trunk bulges, then spits forth a humanoid form made of wood. Its features shift, creaking and cracking, until they resemble your own. You draw forth a humanoid figure from the wood of a tree that is at least one size category larger than yourself. The figure is your size and clearly made of wood, but it resembles you sufficiently that anyone who knows you can recognize your features in its face. The figure can emerge from the tree you touch, or from any tree of the same type within the spell's range. Thereafter, if you and the forest child separate by more than the maximum range of the spell, or if you lose line of effect to it, it vanishes instantly and the spell ends. A forest child mimics your actions, including speech, unless you direct it to act differently as a move action. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing in its location, and you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action anytime during your turn. While you are using its senses, your own body is considered blinded and deafened. If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the forest child instead of from you. It cannot, however, cast any spells on itself. Spells cast through the forest child function normally in all respects except for the point of origin. A forest child has a number of hit points equal to your character level. If you use it to attack physically, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, and it deals damage equal to your unarmed damage. As a standard action, you can change places with your duplicate. (Although the spell itself is a transmutation, this usage is a conjuration [teleportation] effect.) Making use of this option reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 5 rounds. If you have fewer than 5 rounds of duration left, you cannot invoke this ability. If you cast this spell along with both forest eyes and forest voice (see below), the duration of forest child doubles, and its range quadruples. Material Component: A small hardwood replica of yourself, which costs 10 gp to create.
Forest Eyes.MOD			DESC:The moment your hand contacts the rough wood, your vision swims, blurs, and resolves into a different image. Upon casting this spell, you can touch a normal, Medium or larger plant or tree and designate another of the same kind. You immediately see the surroundings of the destination plant, regardless of the distance separating the two. You see the area as though you were standing in the exact spot where the destination plant stands. You cannot move your field of vision from that spot, but you can rotate it in all directions to observe the area around the destination plant. Unlike other scrying spells, forest eyes does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally dark, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the plant at the center of the spell's effect. Both plants must be alive to allow use of this spell. You can either select a particular destination plant that is already familiar to you, or designate a direction and distance and let forest eyes find the appropriate type of plant nearest to the desired location.
Forest Voice.MOD			DESC:You touch the leaves and speak, and your comrade answers you through the plant. Upon casting this spell, you can touch a normal, Medium or larger plant or tree and designate another of the same kind. You can then carry on a conversation with anyone who is within 10 feet of the destination plant. Your conversation is as clear as it would be if you stood within 10 feet of one another. The plants cannot, however, transmit magical sonic effects. Both plants must be alive to allow use of this spell. You can either select a particular destination plant that is already familiar to you, or designate direction and distance and let the forest voice find the appropriate type of plant nearest to the desired location.
Healing Circle.MOD		DESC:A circle of warm comfort emanates from you, enveloping those who enter in positive energy. By casting this spell, you create an aura of healing energy upon which your allies can draw to mend their own wounds. The spell has five charges when cast. Once per round as a standard action, a single allied creature within 30 feet can drain one charge from the healing circle. The first charge so drained functions as a cure critical wounds spell, the second as a cure serious wounds spell, the third as a cure.MODerate wounds spell, and the fourth as a cure light wounds spell, and the final charge heals only 5 points of damage. A creature must be conscious to draw a charge from the healing circle. The spell effect delivered by each charge functions as if you had personally cast the associated spell. Thus, the first charge heals 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20), and so on.
Iconic Manifestation.MOD	DESC:Your mind opens to an awareness of a new, spiritual world beyond the natural realm. Its energies flow into you even as the spirits of the beasts and the trees always have. The descriptor of this spell matches the non-neutral component of your own alignment. For instance, if you are lawful neutral, you cast iconic manifestation as a lawful spell. If you are neutral, you cannot cast it at all. Once you cast the spell, you have up to 10 minutes per caster level to invoke its power before it is spent. At any point during this period, you can choose to spend one daily use of your wild shape ability to take on aspects of your non-neutral alignment. You temporarily acquire the celestial template (MM 31) if you are good, the fiendish template (MM 107) if you are evil, the anarchic template (Manual of the Planes 198) if you are chaotic, or the axiomatic template (Manual of the Planes 197) if you are lawful. (If your campaign does not use Manual of the Planes, you can approximate the axiomatic template by using the celestial template, and substituting lawful for good and chaotic for evil. You can approximate the anarchic template by using the fiendish template and making the same substitution.) Once invoked, this transformation lasts 1 minute per caster level. You can still use your wild shape ability to take on other forms without negating this spell. Note: Adding a template "on the fly" can dramatically slow game-play. If you anticipate using this spell, write down the relevant adjustments-both to your normal form and to any animal, plant, or elemental forms you regularly assume-before play begins.
Impede.MOD				DESC:Your will clamps down on the subject's mind, making the slightest movement a strenuous effort. This spell locks the subject in place. An affected creature is capable of taking actions, such as attacking or casting spells, but it cannot step from its current square (or squares, if it occupies more than one). The subject also takes a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and a -2 penalty on Reflex saves while so rooted. If the subject succeeds on the initial Will save, it suffers no ill effects and the spell ends immediately. If it fails the initial save, it can attempt a new Will save every round thereafter. Once the subject succeeds on one of these secondary saves, it can move, but its base speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) for the duration of the spell. If the subject has multiple.MODes of movement, each is reduced accordingly. If the subject is already under an effect that curtails its ability to move (such as slow or hold person), it also takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity for the duration of this spell, even if the other effect ends before this one does.
Interfaith Blessing.MOD		DESC:You feel your deity speaking through you to other gods, filling the space around you with diverse divine energies that strengthen your ally. When you cast interfaith blessing, every creature within range is individually blessed by its own deity for the duration of the spell. The specific blessing gained depends on the particular deity worshiped, as given on the table below. A subject that venerates more than one deity must roll randomly to determine which blessing is received. Deity Blessing Bahamut, St. Cuthbert, +1 on attack rolls and saves or Yondalla Boccob, Corellon +1 on attack rolls and skill checks Larethian, Vecna, or Wee Jas Ehlonna, Obad-Hai, +1 on attack rolls and to AC or the general worship of nature Erythnul, Gruumsh, or Lolth +2 on damage rolls Fharlanghn, Moradin, or Pelor +2 to AC Garl Glittergold, Roll 1d8 to determine blessing; Olidammara, or no deity a result of 6 is player's choice Heironeous, Hextor, or Nerull +2 on attack rolls Kord, Kurtulmak, +1 on attack rolls and damage rolls or Tiamat
Light of Courage.MOD		DESC:Your holy symbol is wreathed in a wrathful, iridescent glow that causes undead creatures to wither before its celestial light. You temporarily infuse your holy symbol with divine power. If you make a turning check before the duration expires, each undead creature that you target takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels you possess (maximum 10d8) in addition to effects of the turning (if any). The turning check need not succeed to trigger this effect.
Light of Faith.MOD		DESC:A warm, comforting glow surrounds your holy symbol, renewing your faith and causing the wicked monsters before you to recoil in fear. This spell grants you a sacred (if you are good or neutral) or profane (if you are evil) bonus equal to one-half your divine caster level (maximum +5) on your next turning check.
Light of Purity.MOD		DESC:Your holy symbol gleams with a bright, white light that seems to cleanse the air around you of the foul stench emanating from your undead enemies. When you cast this spell on your holy symbol, your turning damage increases by 1d6 per four divine caster levels you possess (maximum +5d6) on your next successful turning check.
Light of Wisdom.MOD		DESC:A cool, blue radiance pours forth from your extended holy symbol, increasing your power against the foul scourge of the undead. When you cast light of wisdom upon your holy symbol, your effective turning level increases by 1 per three caster levels. These bonus levels apply only for the purpose of determining the most powerful undead that your turning check can affect and whether or not the undead you turn are destroyed outright. The increase has no bearing on the amount of turning damage you deal with a successful turn attempt.
Lore of the Gods.MOD		DESC:Your mind opens to the secrets of the cosmos and briefly touches the omniscience of the gods. You gain a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks. At any point before the duration expires, you can make a check with a Knowledge skill in which you have no ranks, or retry a Knowledge check you have previously failed. The +5 insight bonus still applies in both of those cases, but utilizing this option reduces the spell's remaining duration to 1 minute/level. If you worship a deity who grants access to the Knowledge domain, the bonus is +10 rather than +5-even if you did not choose that domain.
Mark of Sin.MOD			DESC:You bring forth the subject's inner sins and crimes, causing them to manifest in its appearance and aura. Your successful touch attack leaves a mystical mark upon the subject. After a number of rounds equal to your divine caster level, the subject is entitled to a Will save. Success ends the spell at that point, but failure renders the mark of sin permanent. Though the mark is invisible, all living creatures can sense its presence and are repulsed by it. Thus, they begin their initial interactions with the subject one step nearer to a hostile attitude than they normally would, unless they already know the subject personally. Furthermore, the subject takes a -10 circumstance penalty on all Diplomacy checks designed to change the attitudes of others. (See Diplomacy, PH 71.) In addition, the subject takes a -4 penalty to a specific ability score based on your deity, as given in the table for the divine retribution spell (page 119). This penalty cannot be removed in any way as long as the mark of sin remains. If you do not worship a deity, you must choose one whose alignment is within one step of your own when you cast this spell for the first time. This choice is for the purpose of this effect only, and you cannot subsequently change it unless your alignment shifts in such a way that your previous choice is no longer applicable. A mark of sin cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than that of the mark of sin.
Master Cavalier.MOD		DESC:When you utter the final words of this spell, your muscles and equilibrium shift dramatically, making you feel more at home in the saddle than you do on your own feet. Upon casting this spell, you gain a +10 bonus on all Ride checks. If you have special mount or similar class ability, your bonus on Ride checks increases to +20 while you are mounted on your special mount. If you cast master cavalier along with phantom charge (see below) and war-mount (page 129), the three spells have a synergistic effect. By shunting a tiny amount of its physical form into the plane from which it normally comes, your mount gains the ability to walk on liquids or even on empty air. This adjustment grants it a fly speed equal to its normal land-based movement rate, with average maneuverability. This effect lasts until either master cavalier or war-mount expires.
Metal Fang.MOD			DESC:The subject's natural weapons take on a gleaming, metallic sheen. You temporarily transform one of the subject's natural weapons into either cold iron or silvered, thereby allowing it to bypass the appropriate form of damage reduction. The affected natural weapon also counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, though it gains no enhancement bonuses on attack or damage rolls. You can cast the spell twice on the same weapon to make it function as both cold iron and silvered.
Moral Facade.MOD			DESC:With an uttered incantation and a motion of your hand, you surround your target with a haze that prevents others from discerning its true nature. By casting this spell, you cloak the target in an effect that gives a false alignment reading to all divination spells. At the time of casting, you must designate the alignment that you wish the spell to reveal.
Phantom Charge.MOD		DESC:You and your mount utter a fierce call as one. The beating of its hooves grows almost deafening, and the world around you begins to shimmer. If you cast this spell while mounted on your special mount or mount-sized fiendish companion, you tap into the energies normally released only when you summon or dismiss that creature, creating a short-range teleportation effect. Between a single pair of steps, you and your mount can teleport directly forward once, moving up to 5 feet per two caster levels. Many paladins use this spell to attack over rough terrain that would normally prevent a charge. Because this spell can be cast while your mount is moving, the creature can move part of its speed both before and after the spell takes effect. If you cast this spell in conjunction with master cavalier (page 124) and war-mount (page 129), the three spells have a synergistic effect. See the master cavalier spell description for details.
Profane Item.MOD			DESC:Negative forces flow through your hands and into the object you hold, filling it with a darkly glowing power that gleams for a moment, then subsides. You imbue a touched object with latent negative energy. If the item thereafter touches or is touched by an animal or plant of any alignment, or by an outsider or shapechanger of good alignment, the negative energy discharges with a loud snap, dealing 1d4 points of negative energy damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to that creature. If the creature discharging the item is an animal or plant, it must save against fear or flee in terror (or cower, if it cannot move) for 1d4 minutes. On a successful save, the creature is merely shaken for the same length of time. If the creature discharging the item is a shapechanger, an image of its natural form or most common alternate form appears for 1d4 rounds, superimposed over its body, revealing its true nature to all witnesses. Profane item counters and dispels sacred item (see below).
Ravenous Darkness.MOD		DESC:Tendrils of shadow leap from the object you've touched, then swiftly form into an all-encompassing wave. The spreading night seems to blot out both light and life. The object touched sheds darkness as a deeper darkness spell (PH 217). In addition, every living creature within the area of the resulting darkness (a 60-foot radius) takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage per round. Any creature under the influence of an ongoing negative energy effect (such as negative levels or necromantic-based ability damage) instead takes 2d6 points of damage per round. This effect ends for a given creature if it moves out of the area of darkness but resumes should it reenter. A successful Fortitude save negates the damage, but the affected creature must repeat the save every round, whether it succeeds or fails. If a creature has spell resistance, the spell must overcome it to deal damage. Any undead creature within the darkness instead gains fast healing 1. Ravenous darkness counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level.
Rejuvenating Light.MOD		DESC:A soft, comforting glow emanates from the object you've touched, filling the entire area with light and warmth. Though seemingly gentle, the light pierces the shadows like the rays of the sun. The object touched sheds light as a daylight spell (PH 216). In addition, every living creature within the area of bright light (a 60-foot radius) gains fast healing 1. This effect ends for a given creature if it moves out of the area of light but resumes should it reenter. Any undead creature within the area of light takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage per round. An undead creature that is particularly vulnerable to sunlight (such as a vampire) instead takes 2d6 points of damage per round. A successful Fortitude save negates this damage, but the affected creature must repeat the save every round, whether it succeeds or fails. If the undead creature has spell resistance, the spell must overcome it to deal damage. Rejuvenating light counters and dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level.
Sacred Item.MOD			DESC:Protective forces flow through your hands into the object you hold, suffusing it with a golden glow that shines for a moment, then subsides. You imbue a touched object with latent positive energy. If the item thereafter touches or is touched by an undead creature of any alignment, or by an outsider or shapechanger of evil alignment (other than yourself), the positive energy discharges with a flash of light, dealing 1d4 points of positive energy damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to that creature. If the creature discharging the item is undead, it must save against fear or flee in terror (or cower, if it cannot move) for 1d4 minutes. On a successful save, the creature is merely shaken for the same length of time. If the creature discharging the item is a shapechanger, an image of its natural form or most common alternate form appears for 1d4 rounds, superimposed over its body, revealing its true nature to all witnesses. Sacred item counters and dispels profane item (see above).
Seed of Life.MOD			DESC:The energy of life flows through you, warming your hand-and indeed your very soul. But instead of swiftly infusing that life into others to heal their wounds, you feed it slowly and gradually into your ally. You implant a tiny seed of positive energy into the subject's soul. This seed of life grants the subject fast healing 2 for the duration of the spell, in much the same way as vigorSC. At any point before the duration expires, the subject can exhaust the remaining positive energy in a sudden burst of healing as a standard action. When this option is exercised, roll a number of d4s equal to one-half the spell's remaining duration, rounded down (for example, 5d4 if the spell has 11 rounds remaining). The result is the number of hit points of damage instantly healed. Using this option ends the spell immediately.
Soul Ward.MOD			DESC:Your comrade's thoughts and feelings meld with yours, each bolstering the other, through the touch of your hand. This spell functions like body ward (page 117), except that you choose one of the three mental abilities-Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-rather than a physical ability to be affected.
Spiritual Advisor.MOD		DESC:When you chant the final words of your incantation, a soft, comforting voice seems to whisper in your ear, "What knowledge may I impart to you?" Spiritual advisor allows you to consult with a spirit, an angel, or some other divine aspect of your deity. This advisor manifests as a barely shimmering orb that floats above one of your shoulders. When it speaks, only you can hear its counsel. As long as the spiritual advisor is present, it helps you recall bits of trivia, history, or other knowledge. This knowledge can be as general or specific as is required, and the information gained grants you a +4 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks while the spell is in effect. You can even attempt checks with Knowledge skills in which you have no skill ranks or retry a Knowledge check you failed before casting the spell.
Spiritual Guardian.MOD		DESC:The sound of hoofbeats begins in the distance and draws swiftly nearer. As though leaping down from an invisible charger, a translucent knight, clad head to toe in heavy plate, appears by your side. The holy symbol of your deity is emblazoned across his tabard and shield. By casting this spell, you create a translucent knight made of force. It remains within 5 feet of you at all times, constantly matching your speed and.MODe of travel-even if you are mounted or magically accelerated. Any time you are attacked, it moves to parry the attack with its shield or longsword, granting you a +6 deflection bonus to Armor Class. As a standard action in any round, you can command the knight to make a single attack against any creature within 5 feet. It strikes with its longsword, using your base attack bonus and applying your Wisdom.MODifier to the roll. The attack deals 1d8 points of force damage +1 extra point per three caster levels (maximum +10). At any point before the spell expires, you can turn the knight loose and order it to fight on its own. It then moves at a speed of 60 feet to attack any foe you designate. It continues to use your base attack bonus and your Wisdom.MODifier for its attack rolls, and it can make as many attacks per round as your base attack bonus allows. You need not concentrate on the knight as long as it is fighting a specific opponent, but commanding it to change foes requires a move action. If its opponent falls, the knight waits for your direction. Once you have turned the knight loose, you lose the deflection bonus to Armor Class that it provided, and you cannot regain it. Furthermore, the remaining duration of the spell converts from minutes per level to rounds per level on a one-to-one basis.
Subdue Aura.MOD			DESC:The normally formidable aura that marks you as a servant of a higher power recedes, leaving few traces of your allegiance visible to creatures that can see such marks. This spell masks the target's aura, making it appear less powerful than it really is. For every two caster levels, the target of a subdue aura spell appears to have 1 fewer Hit Die than it really does. If the target has no aura, the spell has no effect.
Substitute Domain.MOD		DESC:The power of your deity courses through you, replacing what you once knew with different ideas and abilities. Upon casting substitute domain, you can swap one of your current domains for another that your deity offers. You gain the granted power of the new domain, as well as access to any of its spells that you can cast-though you must still prepare the spells normally. While substitute domain is in effect, you lose the granted powers and spells of the domain to which you have given up access. For example, Saera, a cleric of Pelor, normally has access to the Strength and Sun domains. She casts substitute domain on herself and chooses to swap the Strength domain for another of the domains that Pelor normally grants- namely Healing. While she can now access the spells and granted power of the Healing domain, Saera cannot tap the abilities and spells normally associated with the Strength domain.
Summon Holy Symbol.MOD		DESC:You whisper a prayer to your deity, and his symbol appears in your hand. You conjure a small holy symbol, which you can then use to turn undead, or as a divine focus for spells, or for any other purpose that you would normally use one. The conjured holy symbol is made of wood and is neither magical nor particularly valuable.
Surge of Fortune.MOD		DESC:The power of your deity flows through you, guiding your movements and honing your instincts. Upon casting this spell, you gain a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and spell penetration checks, as well as to Armor Class. At any point before the spell expires, you can channel some of its remaining power into a single instant of perfect fortune as an immediate action. The result of the next attack roll, saving throw, skill check, ability check, or spell penetration check you attempt is treated as a natural 20, as long as it occurs within 1 round of the time you invoked this power. (If you use it for an attack roll, you must still roll to confirm the critical hit normally.) Using this option instantly ends the spell.
Touch of Restoration.MOD	DESC:When you pray for the power to restore that which your friend has lost, a beam of sun breaks through the clouds and bathes your hands in golden light. Casting touch of restoration lets you use your lay on hands ability to cure ability damage. While this spell is active, you can cure 1 point of ability damage per caster level by laying on hands, and you can split these points among different creatures if desired. For every point of ability damage you cure in this manner, you must subtract 1 from your effective level when determining how many hit points of damage you can heal with your standard lay on hands ability for the remainder of the day.
Turn Anathema.MOD			DESC:When you clutch your holy symbol, it pulses briefly with divine power, then grows oddly cold beneath your fingers. Choose one non-neutral aspect of your own alignment- chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. If you are neutral, you must choose an alignment component for this spell when you first cast it, and this choice cannot be altered for subsequent castings unless your alignment has changed in such a way as to make that choice unsuitable. The spell takes on the descriptor of the selected alignment component. Upon casting this spell, you can use one of your daily turn or rebuke attempts to turn creatures with the opposing alignment subtype as though they were undead. For instance, if you cast turn anathema as a good spell, you could attempt to turn creatures of the evil subtype, such as demons. You could not, however, turn a red dragon, because although it is an evil creature, it lacks the evil subtype. This spell allows only turning, not rebuking or destroying, even if you normally rebuke rather than turn. You can use as many of your daily turn/rebuke attempts as you wish in this way for the duration of the spell.
War-Mount.MOD			DESC:At your touch, your mount's flanks ripple, and its eyes blaze with newfound energy. You render the natural attacks of your mount or fiendish companion magical with a touch. The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with its natural weapons for the duration of the spell. They are treated as both magic and good-aligned (paladin) or evilaligned (blackguard) weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If you cast this spell in conjunction with master cavalier (page 124) and phantom charge (page 125), the three spells have a synergistic effect. See the master cavalier spell description for details.
Weight of Sin.MOD			DESC:You use the raw power of your deity to reach into your target's soul and pull forth its sins, leaving their horror exposed for all to see. You affect the target differently based on how its alignment compares to your own. If the target's alignment is the same as yours, weight of sin has no effect. If the target's alignment differs from yours but contains no directly opposing components (for example, the target is neutral good and you are lawful neutral), the spell deals 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum 15) and has no secondary effect. If the target's alignment has one aspect opposed to yours (such as law/chaos), but not both, the spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4), and the subject suffers a minor secondary effect (see the table above). If the target's alignment is diametrically opposed to yours (such as lawful good/chaotic evil), the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), and the subject suffers a.MODerate secondary effect (see the table below). If you cast this spell on the same target in 2 consecutive rounds, any secondary effect the spell has increases by one "step" in severity. That is, if the spell caused a minor effect on the first casting, it now causes a.MODerate effect, and if it caused a.MODerate effect, it now causes a major effect. Minor and.MODerate effects end in 1 round per caster level, but major effects are permanent until dispelled. In all cases, the subject is entitled to a Fortitude save for half damage, and then a Will save to negate the secondary effect, if any. The target is entitled to this Will save even if the spell duplicated by the secondary effect normally does not permit one.
Wooden Blight.MOD			DESC:The spirit of the trees manifests within your foe, slowing and transforming its body. You transform the subject's body into wood from the inside out. Each round, the subject must make a new saving throw or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. Success halves the Dexterity damage from that round and ends the spell. A subject whose Dexterity is reduced to 0 or lower by this spell transforms, along with its gear, into a mindless, inert, wooden statue. A creature in this state is not actually dead, but it does not register as alive either when viewed with spells such as deathwatch. If the target already has Dexterity damage or a penalty to Dexterity, wooden blight is even more debilitating. Each round in which the subject takes Dexterity damage from this spell, its base movement rate is reduced by 5 feet for every point of Dexterity damage it takes (minimum speed 5 feet). Creatures of the plant type are immune to this spell. Material Component: A sliver of wood from a living tree.
