# COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS
# Equipment Name							Type				Cost		Source Page		Special Property
Angel's Blood							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:85	SOURCEPAGE:p.131	SPROP:Those who manage to shed celestial blood often collect a few drops for sale to other, equally vile souls. When blended with specific poisons and used as a component in the casting of any spell that has the evil descriptor, angel's blood increases the save DC by 1.
Ashes of Power							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:1750	SOURCEPAGE:p.131	SPROP:When a used scroll is burned and its ashes are mixed with holy water and mystical inks, the resulting paste houses an ember of true magic. When used as a component in the casting of dispel magic, greater dispel magic, or break enchantment, this powder allows the caster to make two dispel checks and choose the better result.
Aurial Sapphire							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:215	SOURCEPAGE:p.131	SPROP:On rare occasions, the winds of the Elemental Plane of Air capture various particles whipping about in the emptiness and drive them together over the course of years. The result is a crystal marbled in various shades of blue. Called aurial sapphires, these gemstones are sometimes found on the Material Plane, usually at high altitudes where the winds blow most fiercely. When an aurial sapphire is used as a component in the casting of any Air domain spell or spell that has the air descriptor, the spell is affected as if by the Quicken Spell feat, but without any level increase.
Crypt Powder							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:150	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:During the long years in which a powerful necromancer lies decaying in his tomb, some of the magic that infused his bones seeps into the surrounding walls. If one of these stones is then shattered in a particular way, the resulting dust sometimes retains that power. When used as a component in the casting of any spell that targets either corpses or undead, this powder increases both the save DC and the caster level by 1.
Doppelganger Bile							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:95	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:This viscous fluid aids in deceptive magic. When specially distilled and used as a component in the casting of any spell that grants invisibility or a bonus on Disguise checks, doppelganger bile doubles the duration of the effect.
Dragon Ruby								TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:175	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Gold dragons like to feast on pearls and gems. Occasionally, a few gems pass through such a dragon's system undigested. If one of those gems is a ruby, it absorbs a bit of the creature's fiery nature and becomes a dragon ruby. When used as a component in the casting of any spell that has the fire descriptor, a dragon ruby doubles that spell's area.
Essence of Order							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:300	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:When various powdered herbs are mixed with the inner fluids of an inevitable, the resulting oily substance emits a potent vapor known as essence of order. Anyone breathing this vapor is cured of 1 point of mental ability damage caused by a poison or disease. A single dose is usable only once. When used as a component in the casting of any spell that has the law descriptor, essence of order increases the save DC by 1.
Feather of the Far Reaches					TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:95	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:When coated in a thin layer of powdered mithral, the tailfeathers of an albatross or an arrowhawk gain a degree of magical power. If one of these so-called feathers of the far reaches is used as a component in the casting of any Travel domain spell, it either adds 10 feet to the speed (if the spell grants a new or improved mode of movement) or increases the effective caster level by 1.
Game of Fate							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:550	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Long ago, someone discovered that a die carved from the shell of a large tortoise attracts the attention of the deities of luck. When used as a component in the casting of any spell that grants a bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, or checks, such a die-known as a game of fate-produces one of three effects: +1 caster level (01–45), double duration (46–90), or restoration of a spell as per a pearl of power (91–100).
Guardinal Feather							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:600	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:The feathers of a guardinal, when given freely, have protective properties. When one is used as a component in the casting of any spell that grants either energy resistance or a bonus to Armor Class, it increases the value of that protection by 2.
Hero's Tears							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:675	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Tears taken from a champion of good who weeps over a fallen comrade become a potent aid to virtuous casters when sanctified with bless water. If these hero's tears are used as a component in the casting of any spell that has the good descriptor, they increase the effective caster level by 2.
Horn of Gorgon							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:575	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Gorgon horns soften when soaked in a particular kind of rare vinegar. If this horn of gorgon is then used as a component in the casting of any spell that enhances Strength-whether by an enhancement bonus, a size increase, or any other means-it adds 2 to the subject's Strength, on top of the spell's normal effects.
Kiss of Discord							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:310	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:An herb known by sages as lusiri blossom, kiss of discord has dull red leaves that vaguely resemble lips. When ingested, it causes hallucinations (1d3 hours, Fort DC 13 negates, treat as confusion). If used as a component in the casting of any spell that has the chaos descriptor, it increases the effective caster level by 2.
Obaddis Leaf							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:130	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:A rare variety of holly, this plant retains some of the magic that passes through it when it is used as a divine focus by a druid. If it is then used as a component in the casting of a Plant domain spell or any spell that specifi- cally targets plants, it doubles both the area and the duration.
Pearl of the Waves						TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:225	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:A pearl of the waves results when an oyster forms a pearl around the tiniest fragment of a magic item, such as a sliver of a magic blade or wood from a broken staff. If this pearl is used as a component in the casting of any Water domain spell or a spell that has the water descriptor, the spell is affected as if by the Quicken Spell feat, but without any change in spell slot.
Scholar's Dreams							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:175	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Some say that ivy growing on the gravestone of a truly learned sage feeds upon the knowledge of the deceased. When used as a component in the casting of any Knowledge domain spell, this ivy-known as scholar's dreams-doubles both the range and the duration.
Soil of Stone							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:65	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Taken from beneath the palaces of the dao (genies of Elemental Earth), this powdered stone retains traces of both that plane and its masters. If this so-called soil of stone is used as a component in the casting of any Earth domain spell or a spell that has the earth descriptor, it doubles the duration.
Sunflower of Pelor						TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:100	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:For reasons unfathomable to sages, large sunflowers often grow in the soil where an undead creature has been reduced to ash by a cleric's turn undead ability. The petals of these sunflowers of Pelor, if properly treated with various unguents, grant power to sun-related spells. When used as a component in the casting of any Sun domain spell or a spell that has the light descriptor, these petals double its area.
Talon of Ehlonna							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:370	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:When an animal dies while under the effect of a magic fang or greater magic fang spell, one of its claws or teeth sometimes retains a spark of that magic. This so-called talon of Ehlonna resists decay and gains a goldbronze luster over time. When used as a component in the casting of any Animal domain spell or a spell that specifically targets animals, the talon increases the effective caster level by 2.
True Warrior's Blade						TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:650	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:A weapon wielded by a deity's champion, then broken in combat, can be consecrated with holy water and unguents to become a true warrior's blade. When used as a component in the casting of any divine spell that deals hit point damage, this blade increases the damage dealt by 2 points per spell level.
Twilight Green							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:250	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:A distant relative of belladonna, this herb is a deadly poison (ingestion, DC 14 Fortitude negates, primary and secondary damage 1d4 Constitution). When used as a component in the casting of any spell that deals negative energy damage, however, twilight green increases that damage by 1 point per spell level.
Unicorn Horn							TYPE:Gear.Component	COST:190	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:If a horn taken from a unicorn that has died of natural causes is used as a component in the casting of any touch spell that has the healing descriptor, it transforms the spell into a ray with a 30-foot range.

# HOLY SYMBOL DESCRIPTIONS
Blood-Face of Erythnul						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:This rust-colored talisman depicts a face cackling with evil laughter. Swaths of bloodred highlight the open, grinning mouth and the brow ridge, giving the face a wild, almost demonic look. When used as a focus for illusion spells or spells with the chaotic designator, a blood-face of Erythnul increases the save DC by 1.																																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Barbs of Hextor							TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:The shape of this dark-colored, metallic talisman is that of a mailed fist grasping barbed arrows. When used to cast Evil domain spells or spells that have the evil descriptor, this symbol increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																																															QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Bolt of Heironeous						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:Cast in the shape of a hand grasping a lightning bolt, this holy symbol is usually made of silver, gold, or a combination of both. When used to cast Good domain spells or spells that have the good descriptor, this symbol increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																																									QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Devastation of Nerull						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:This symbol is either carved from bone or made from the skeleton of a Diminutive creature, and it always appears to be decaying. Worshipers of Nerull typically either grow lichen on it, or whet it with a small amount of acid. As a result, it usually carries a mildly unpleasant odor. When used to cast a spell from the necromancy school or the Death domain, or when brandished to rebuke or command (not turn or destroy) unintelligent undead, this symbol increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																			QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Ehlonna's Brooch							TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Worn by worshipers of the goddess of the woodlands, this emerald carving of a unicorn rampant sometimes seems to blend into the wearer's garb. When grasped and used as a focus for a spell, it exudes a faint green glow. When Ehlonna's brooch is used as a focus for a summon animal or summon monster spell, each creature summoned gains +1 hit point per Hit Die.																																																																																																																																																										QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Fharlanghn's Badge						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This symbol is almost always made to look like a worn, weathered piece of wood bearing a crude carving of a sunset. In actuality, a Fharlanghn's badge is almost always made from materials that have traveled a long way, such as driftwood, or the planks of a settler's wagon. When brandished during the casting of any spell that increases a creature's speed (or even one that imparts a new mode of movement, such as fly), Fharlanghn's badge increases the target's speed by an additional 5 feet. This item has no effect on spells that magically transport a character from one place to another (such as teleport or dimension door).																																																																																																													QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Obad-Hai's Green Man						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Always made from living wood and green leaves, this symbol remains fresh as long as you remain alive and pay homage to the nature god. Only upon close inspection can nonworshipers see the face hidden amid the leaves. When used to cast spells from the Animal or Plant domain, Obad-Hai's green man increases your caster level by 2. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus on turn or rebuke checks made against plant creatures while brandishing it.																																																																																																																																												QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Mirror of Olidammara						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This symbol looks like a plain silver hand mirror, but anyone who looks into the glass sees a theatrical mask with half the face dark and smiling and the other half white and scowling. This image is not magical in nature- the glass is not a mirror, and the mask is simply embedded in the backing. When held forth during the casting of Luck domain spells or spells that have the chaotic descriptor, the mirror of Olidammara increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																								QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Moradin's Forge							TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Usually made of a heavy metal (lead, adamantine, or even gold) and painted flat black, this talisman comes in two parts-a model hammer and a tiny anvil. Most crafters attach the two parts with a thin but strong and flexible wire, so that the hammer can be struck against the anvil during casting. Doing so isn't strictly necessary, but many worshipers of the Soul Forger feel the action is appropriate. When used to cast Earth domain spells or spells that have the earth descriptor, Moradin's forge increases the save DC by 1. In addition, it increases your effective caster level by 1 when used to turn or rebuke air creatures (as the Earth domain granted power).																																																																																																							QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Nugget of Garl Glittergold					TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This small symbol looks like a chunk of unrefined gold ore-because it is. Blessed by gnome priests, it is even more precious than its materials suggest. When used to cast Trickery domain or illusion spells, a nugget of Garl Glittergold increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																																							QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Ruby Skull of Wee Jas						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This stylized symbol carved from ruby resembles a skull stretched and twisted by magic. Its empty eye sockets stare unceasingly at the viewer. When used as a focus for Death domain or necromancy spells, a ruby skull of Wee Jas increases your effective caster level by 1. In addition, when used to rebuke or command (not turn or destroy) undead, it grants a +1 bonus on your turning damage rolls.																																																																																																																																																				QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Silver Badge of Larethian					TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This moon-sliver symbol is always silver in color and often decorated with etched or embossed images of leaves, berries, and nuts. Worshipers of the Protector keep these items highly polished so that they shine brightly in moonlight. When displayed while casting Protection domain or abjuration spells, a silver badge of Larethian increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																							QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Stone Socket of Gruumsh						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Orcs and other worshipers of Gruumsh sometimes carve these holy symbols out of stone, making them look like empty eye sockets. During the consecration rituals, they pour blood (usually taken from the eyes of their sacrificial victims) into the hole to stain the stone permanently. When used to cast War domain spells or spells that have the evil descriptor, a stone socket of Gruumsh grants a bonus equal to +1 per damage die on damage rolls made for the spells. However, this bonus cannot increase a spell's damage beyond its normal limit. So if used with spiritual weapon, which normally deals damage equal to 1d8 points +1 point/ three caster levels, the stone socket of Gruumsh grants a +1 bonus on the damage roll. However, that bonus cannot bring the damage above 8 points for a 1st-level caster, or above 13 points (1d8+5 maximum) for a 15th-level caster.																																																																						QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Sun Disk of Pelor							TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Worshipers of Pelor believe they can feel the sun's warmth through their golden, sun-shaped talismans. One surface of each sun disk of Pelor is emblazoned with a stern but somehow comforting face, and the holy disks do shine in both sun and torchlight. When used to cast Sun domain or conjuration (healing) spells, a sun disk of Pelor grants a +1 bonus on healing (or damage) rolls made for the spells. However, this bonus cannot increase a spell's healing or damage beyond its normal limit. So if used with cure moderate wounds, which normally heals damage equal to 2d8 points +1 point/caster level, a sun disk of Pelor grants a +1 bonus on the roll. However, that bonus cannot bring the healing above 19 points (2d8+3 maximum) for a 3rd-level caster, or above 21 points (2d8+5 maximum) for a 5th-level caster.																																																																														QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Talisman of Boccob						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:Usually worn on the chest, this pale yellow symbol depicts a stylized eye that appears to glow with an inner light. You must touch it with at least one hand to gain its benefit. When used to cast Knowledge domain or divination spells, a talisman of Boccob grants you a +1 bonus on caster level checks and on any follow-up Spellcraft checks necessary to complete the spell (such as those required for detect magic).																																																																																																																																																QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Vanguard of Kord							TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This small, round, convex disk is decorated like a tribal war shield, with black weapons crossed on a blood-red background. The disk almost always shows signs of wear and hard use. When used to cast Luck domain or transmutation spells, a vanguard of Kord increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																																				QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Vecna's Hand and Eye						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:The typical worshiper of Vecna keeps her holy symbol hidden until it is time to cast spells. The talisman of the God of Secrets looks like a dark hand grasping a large, bloodshot eye. Alternatively, sometimes the hand's fingers are outstretched, and the eye is embedded in the palm. Either way, the disquieting symbol represents both the deity and the artifacts that bear his name. When used to cast any spell from the Knowledge or Magic domain, Vecna's hand and eye increases your effective caster level and the save DCs by 1.																																																																																																																														QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
War Cross of St. Cuthbert					TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This symbol appears to be a wheel with four equal-length spokes and a gemstone at the hub. To brandish it, you must grasp the symbol by its center, holding the gemstone out. When used to cast any mind-affecting spell or to turn (not rebuke) undead, a war cross of St. Cuthbert increases your effective divine caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																															QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Yondalla's Cornucopia						TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:Sometimes this symbol depicts a cornucopia emblazoned on a green background, but more often than not, it is an actual miniature cornucopia filled with carved wooden fruit. When used to cast Law domain spells, spells that have the good descriptor, or spells that create food or water (such as create food and water or heroes' feast), a cornucopia of Yondalla increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																			QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10

# DOMAIN-FOCUSED HOLY SYMBOLS
Nature's Sickle							TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This symbol resembles a small stone sickle cutting four stalks of wheat. The wheat looks fresh and real, even though it is carved of stone. When the symbol is in use, the wheat actually smells like grain and seems to shine in the sun. When used to cast any spell from the Earth, Plant, or Sun domain, a nature's sickle increases your effective caster level by 1.																																																																																																																																																									QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10
Nature's Children							TYPE:Gear.Holy Symbol	COST:350	SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This wood or stone carving depicts from three to more than a dozen local animals, depending on the fecundity of the region and the intricacy of the carving. Sometimes when you look at it, you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your eye, though further inspection always shows the animals right where they were before. When used to cast spells from the Animal domain list or spells that aid, protect, speak with, or summon animals, this symbol incr																																																																																																																																									QUALITY:Hardness|5	QUALITY:HP|10

Armor Of The Beast.MOD				TYPE:Magic					COST:26175	WT:20		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=ArmorEnhancement																																										QUALITY:ItemLevel|(16th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Body	QUALITY:CasterLevel|10th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 20); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|-					SPROP:If you have the wild shape class feature, this suit of +1 wild studded leather armor grants you one additional use of that ability per day. (It does not, however, grant that ability if you do not already possess it.) This extra use stacks with the one provided by a druid's vestment (DMG 268). Armor of the beast is part of a set known collectively as the trappings of the beast, which also includes the ring of the beast (page 141) and the mantle of the beast (page 140). When you wear all three of these items, you gain a +5 competence bonus on wild empathy checks. In addition, you are treated as one level higher than you are for the purpose of using wild shape. (For instance, an 11th-level druid clad in the trappings of the beast could assume the form of a plant creature.)
Bastion Of Righteous War.MOD			TYPE:Magic					COST:18170	WT:15		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=ShieldEnhancement																																										QUALITY:ItemLevel|(14th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|- (held)	QUALITY:CasterLevel|7th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 18); evocation	QUALITY:Activation|- and immediate				SPROP:This +1 heavy steel shield functions best in the hands of a cleric or paladin. If an enemy scores a critical threat against you, you can expend a turn or rebuke undead attempt as an immediate action to negate the critical threat. You must make this decision before your opponent rolls to confirm the critical threat, and you still take the normal damage from the attack. The cost (in turn/rebuke attempts) to activate the bastion of righteous war increases by 1 for every additional multiple of damage (beyond ×2) that would normally be dealt by the attack's critical hit. For example, negating a critical threat from a heavy pick (which deals four times normal damage on a critical hit) would cost three turn/rebuke undead attempts, rather than one. The bastion of righteous war is part of a set known collectively as the regalia of righteous war, which also includes the blade of righteous war (see below) and the helm of righteous war (page 139). When you hold this blade while wearing the other items in the set, you can spend a turn/rebuke undead attempt as an immediate action to make an attack of opportunity with the blade against any foe that successfully strikes an ally in melee combat, even if you have already made one against that opponent that round. (You must threaten the foe in order to make this attack of opportunity.) The holy symbol pictured on the shield always matches the deity worshiped by the wearer (if any).
Bulwark Of The Living.MOD			TYPE:Magic					COST:10157	WT:10		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=ShieldEnhancement																																										QUALITY:ItemLevel|(12th level)	QUALITY:BodySlot|- (held)	QUALITY:CasterLevel|7th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 18); necromancy	QUALITY:Activation|- and standard (command)	SPROP:A good-aligned character who bears this +1 blinding heavy wooden shield can expend a 4th-level or higher divine spell as a standard action to cast death ward (PH 217) on himself.

# Weapons
Blade Of Righteous War.MOD			TYPE:Magic					COST:12315	WT:4		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.137																																			BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT,DAMAGE|1|TYPE=Enhancement							QUALITY:ItemLevel|(13th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|- (held)	QUALITY:CasterLevel|7th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 18); evocation	QUALITY:Activation|- or free; see text			SPROP:This +1 longsword is favored by paladins and certain clerics. Any time you roll a critical threat with the blade of righteous war, you can sacrifice a turn/rebuke undead attempt as a free action to gain a +4 bonus on the roll made to confirm the critical threat. You must make this decision before making the confirmation roll. The blade of righteous war is part of a set known collectively as the regalia of righteous war, which also includes the helm of righteous war (page 139) and the bastion of righteous war (see above). When you use all three together, you gain an additional benefit as noted in the description of the bastion of righteous war. The holy symbol pictured in the weapon's pommel always matches the deity worshiped by the holder (if any).
Bow Of Elvenkind.MOD				TYPE:Magic					COST:14700	WT:3		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.137																																			BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT,DAMAGE|1|TYPE=Enhancement	BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|max(0,STR)	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(14th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|- (held)	QUALITY:CasterLevel|12th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 21); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|-				SPROP:This +1 composite longbow (+0 Str bonus) automatically adjusts its pull to match the Strength of any elf who wields it. In the hands of a cleric of Corellon Larethian, a bow of elvenkind gains the seeking weapon property (DMG 225), and any critical hit with an arrow fired from the bow renders the target shaken for 5 rounds (a mind-affecting fear effect; Will DC 14 negates). Furthermore, any elf or cleric of Corellon Larethian who uses the bow with arrows from the quiver of elvenkind (page 144) gains the benefit of the Far Shot feat.
Spear Of The Wild.MOD				TYPE:Magic					COST:24302	WT:6		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.137													BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (Nature),Survival|2|TYPE=Competence													BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT,DAMAGE|1|TYPE=Enhancement							QUALITY:ItemLevel|(15th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|- (held)	QUALITY:CasterLevel|12th	QUALITY:Aura|Strong (DC 21); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|-				SPROP:In the hands of most wielders, this weapon is a simple +1 spear that also grants its wielder a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks. If you are a druid, a ranger, or a cleric with the Animal domain, the spear of the wild automatically casts baleful polymorph on any creature upon which it scores a critical hit. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15 + your Wis modifier) negates this effect. This effect functions three times per day.
Staff Of The Vagabond.MOD			TYPE:Magic					COST:3600	WT:2		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.137																																			BONUS:WEAPON|TOHIT,DAMAGE|1|TYPE=Enhancement							QUALITY:ItemLevel|(8th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|- (held)	QUALITY:CasterLevel|9th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 19); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|-						SPROP:This masterwork/master work quarterstaff becomes a +1/+1 quarter staff as long as you are carrying no other weapons. (Natural weapons or unarmed attacks don't count, but weapons you carry in a bag of holding or other container do.) The staff of the vagabond is part of a set known collectively as the garb of the vagabond, which also includes the cloak of the vagabond, the robe of the vagabond, and the sandals of the vagabond. When you wield the staff of the vagabond while wearing any two of the other items, each end gains the merciful property (DMG 225). When you wield it while wearing all three of the other items, each end also gains the ki focus property (DMG 225)

This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn. If you worship Olidammara (or any other deity that offers access to the Luck domain), the bonus instead applies to your attack rolls, saving throws, and Armor Class simultaneously.
Cloak Of The Dragon				TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Cape	COST:6000	WT:1		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.138																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(10th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Shoulders	QUALITY:CasterLevel|10th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 20); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|- and standard		SPROP:Ten varieties of this item exist, each corresponding in hue to one of the five chromatic or the five metallic dragons. While you wear the cloak, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus. If you worship Bahamut or Tiamat (or any other draconic deity), you may activate the cloak of the dragon once per day to grow a pair of draconic wings that grants you a fly speed (equal to your land speed) for 10 minutes. While this effect is active, you may use a breath weapon (as if you were a half-dragon matching the hue of your cloak; see MM 146) once.
Cloak Of The Vagabond				TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Cape	COST:9000	WT:0.5	MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.139																							BONUS:VAR|ColdResistanceBonus,FireResistanceBonus|5|TYPE=Resistance															QUALITY:ItemLevel|(12th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Shoulders	QUALITY:CasterLevel|11th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 20); abjuration	QUALITY:Activation|-					SPROP:While wearing the cloak of the vagabond, you gain resistance 5 to cold and fire. This cloak is part of a set known collectively as the garb of the vagabond, which also includes the robe of the vagabond, the sandals of the vagabond, and the staff of the vagabond. When you wear a cloak of the vagabond while using any two of the other items, it also grants you resistance 5 to electricity. When you use all four set items together, the staff of the vagabond gains an extra benefit (see page 137).
Crest Of Valor					TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Helm	COST:2000	WT:0		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.139																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(6th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Head	QUALITY:CasterLevel|7th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 18); enchantment	QUALITY:Activation|-							SPROP:While wearing a crest of valor, you gain a +2 morale bonus on melee weapon damage rolls while your current hit point total is equal to or less than one-half of your full normal hit points. The crest of valor is part of a set known collectively as the raiment of valor, which also includes the periapt of valor (page 140) and the tabard of valor (page 142). When wearing all three of these items, all allies within 10 feet of you (including yourself ) gain a +4 bonus on saves against fear effects.
Gauntlets Of War					TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Glove	COST:4000	WT:4		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.139	BONUS:COMBAT|DAMAGE.Melee|1																																												QUALITY:ItemLevel|(8th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Hands	QUALITY:CasterLevel|3rd	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 16); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|-							SPROP:While you wear gauntlets of war, you gain a +1 bonus on melee weapon damage. If you worship any deity that grants access to the War domain, this bonus increases to +3 with that deity's favored weapon.
Helm Of Righteous War				TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Helm	COST:5000	WT:3		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.139	BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|2|TYPE=Insight																																										QUALITY:ItemLevel|(9th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Head	QUALITY:CasterLevel|9th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 19); evocation	QUALITY:Activation|- and swift; see text					SPROP:The helm of righteous war grants you a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks and Spot checks. As a swift action, you can sacrifice one daily turn or rebuke undead attempt; this pinpoints the current locations of all enemies within 10 feet of you (even if invisible). You also become immune to being flanked until the start of your next turn. This ability can be activated five times per day. The helm of righteous war is part of a set known collectively as regalia of righteous war, which also includes the bastion of righteous war (page 136) and the blade of righteous war (page 137). When you use all three together, you gain additional abilities as noted in the description of the bastion of righteous war. The holy symbol pictured on the helm always matches the deity worshiped by the wearer (if any).
Lancer's Spurs					TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Boot	COST:12000	WT:0.5	MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.139																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(13th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Feet	QUALITY:CasterLevel|7th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 18); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|-						SPROP:Lancer's spurs always come in pairs, and they do not function if attached to magic footwear, since the two kinds of items occupy the same body slot. While you wear these spurs, any mount you ride gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with its natural weapons. If you are a paladin or other character with a special mount, and you ride that mount while wearing lancer's spurs, the enhancement bonus increases to +2, and the mount's natural weapons are treated as either good- or evil-aligned (as appropriate to your own alignment) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If you are neutral, you must choose the alignment of the spurs when you wear them for the first time, and you cannot thereafter change your mind unless your alignment changes in such a way as to render the initial choice unsuitable.
Mantle Of The Beast				TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Mantle	COST:18000	WT:2		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.140																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(14th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Shoulders	QUALITY:CasterLevel|10th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 20); transmutation	QUALITY:Activation|-				SPROP:The mantle of the beast allows you to use your wild shape ability as a swift action. While wild shaped, your natural weapons gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A mantle of the beast is part of a set known collectively as the trappings of the beast, which also includes the armor of the beast (page 135) and the ring of the beast (see below). When you wear all three items together, you gain additional abilities, as noted in the description of armor of the beast.
Pendant Of Redemption				TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Amulet	COST:8000	WT:1		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.140																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(11th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Throat	QUALITY:CasterLevel|13th	QUALITY:Aura|Strong (DC 21); divination	QUALITY:Activation|-						SPROP:If you are a worshiper of any lawful neutral, lawful good, or neutral good deity, the pendant of redemption refashions itself into the shape of your holy symbol when you don it, and it functions as a divine focus for your spellcasting. You also gain a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks when communicating with any being that can still be redeemed (or is already redeemed) in the eyes of your god. When dealing with a creature that your deity finds unredeemable, the pendant instead grants you a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. You are instinctively aware which skill will work best with a given being. If you're a paladin, you can use the pendant to lead others toward repentance and forgiveness more effectively, if you so choose. While you wear the pendant of redemption, your detect evil ability does not reveal a creature's evil aura but instead whether or not a being can be redeemed, and what a redeemable being must do to achieve full redemption in the eyes of your deity. Some beings might require multiple redemptive acts to make up for their past transgressions, but you know only the most pressing requirement at any given moment. In addition, the competence bonus on Diplomacy checks that the pendant normally grants rises to +10 while you are actively working to convince a creature to embark upon the redemptive action you have divined. If it completes such an act, you can then detect again to see whether any more penance is required. Though the insights you receive do not specifically tell you the details of the subject's original transgression, you can often infer a great deal from the information you gain. For example, if you know that to atone for her sins, a certain person must “give the crown jewels back to the king,” you can be reasonably certain that her transgression involved the theft of the crown jewels. Even with less specific information, such as, “take up a nonviolent profession,” you can guess that the person's profession involved violence.
Periapt Of Valor					TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Amulet	COST:4000	WT:0		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.140																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(8th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Throat	QUALITY:CasterLevel|7th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 18); enchantment	QUALITY:Activation|-							SPROP:While wearing a periapt of valor, you gain a +2 morale bonus on AC and saving throws while your current hit point total is equal to or less than one-half of your full normal hit points. The periapt of valor is part of a set known collectively as the raiment of valor. When you wear it along with a crest of valor (page 139) and a tabard of valor (page 142), you gain additional abilities as given in the description of the crest of valor.
Ring Of The Beast					TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Ring	COST:8000	WT:0		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.141																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(11th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Rings	QUALITY:CasterLevel|10th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 20); conjuration	QUALITY:Activation|-					SPROP:Whenever you cast a summon nature's ally spell (whether normally or spontaneously), you can treat it as though it were one level higher than it is. For instance, if you cast summon nature's ally III (or sacrifice a 3rd-level druid spell to spontaneously cast it), you can treat it as if you had cast summon nature's ally IV instead. However, you cannot use a ring of the beast to cast a summon nature's ally spell of a level higher than you can normally cast (in the class that allows you to cast the summon nature's ally spell). This ring continues to function even while you are using wild shape. The ring of the beast is part of a set collectively known as the trappings of the beast. When you wear it along with armor of the beast (page 135) and a mantle of the beast (see above), you gain additional abilities, as noted in the armor of the beast description.
Robe Of The Vagabond				TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Robe	COST:6000	WT:1		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.141	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=Luck			BONUS:SAVE|ALL|1|TYPE=Luck																																					QUALITY:ItemLevel|(10th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Torso	QUALITY:CasterLevel|18th	QUALITY:Aura|Strong (DC 24); evocation	QUALITY:Activation|-						SPROP:While wearing the robe of the vagabond, you gain a +1 luck bonus to Armor Class and on all saving throws. This robe is part of a set known collectively as the garb of the vagabond, which also includes the cloak of the vagabond, the sandals of the vagabond, and the staff of the vagabond. Using three or more of these items together grants extra benefits, as described in the entries for the cloak of the vagabond and the staff of the vagabond.
Sandals Of The Vagabond				TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Boot	COST:4000	WT:0.5	MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.142	BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|2|TYPE=Luck																																											QUALITY:ItemLevel|(8th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Feet	QUALITY:CasterLevel|11th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 20); divination	QUALITY:Activation|-							SPROP:While wearing sandals of the vagabond, you gain a +2 luck bonus on initiative checks and immunity to exhaustion. You can still become fatigued normally, but any spell or effect that would cause you to become exhausted instead makes you merely fatigued. If you're already fatigued, any effect that would cause you to become exhausted merely extends your fatigue for the number of rounds the exhaustion would have applied. These sandals are part of a set known collectively as the garb of the vagabond, which also includes the cloak of the vagabond, the robe of the vagabond, and the staff of the vagabond. Using three or more of these items together grants extra benefits, as described in the entries for cloak of the vagabond and staff of the vagabond.
Tabard Of Valor					TYPE:Group_Clothing.Magic.Robe	COST:16000	WT:3		MODS:NO			SOURCEPAGE:p.142																																																	QUALITY:ItemLevel|(14th)	QUALITY:BodySlot|Torso	QUALITY:CasterLevel|7th	QUALITY:Aura|Moderate (DC 18); enchantment	QUALITY:Activation|-						SPROP:Whenever your current hit point total is equal to or less than one-half of your full normal hit points, you gain the mettle ability: If you are affected by a spell that would normally have a reduced effect on a successful Fortitude or Will saving throw, it instead has no effect at all upon you if you save successfully. If you already have mettle from a class feature or some other source, you instead gain improved mettle, which halves the harmful effects of a spell on a failed Fortitude or Will save while still protecting you entirely on a successful save. The tabard of valor is part of a set known collectively as the raiment of valor, which also includes the crest of valor (page 139) and the periapt of valor (page 140). When you use a tabard with both of the other items, you gain additional abilities, as noted in the description of the crest of valor.

The reservoir holds a pint of holy water, even though it does not appear large enough to contain such a quantity. Every dawn, an aspergillum of perpetual benediction refills itself, ensuring you a nearly endless supply of holy water. Holy water dispensed from this item loses its blessing after 24 hours. Chaotic, evil, and lawful versions of the aspergillum exist as well, though they are far less common.

Its pages are apparently infinite; no matter how many you turn, more still remain unturned. Once per day, you can attempt a single Knowledge check (as if you were trained) with a +10 insight bonus after perusing the book for 2d4 hours. If you're a worshiper of Boccob (or any deity that offers access to the Knowledge domain), the time required is only 1d4 hours.

Any nonmagical arrow drawn forth from the quiver functions as a +1 arrow (as long as it has been held in the quiver for at least the previous hour). This magic fades after 1 round. If you are an elf or a worshiper of Corellon Larethian, however, any nonmagical arrow drawn from the quiver functions instead as a +1 orc bane arrow, and on a critical hit permanently blinds any living target (Fortitude DC 14 negates). If you are an elf using this quiver in conjunction with a bow of elvenkind (page 137), you gain additional benefits as noted in the description of that item.
