# Feat Name			Type			Multiple Requirements														Description																																			Source Page		Benefits
Altitude Adaptation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																		DESC:+4 bonus to Fort Save against altitude checks.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.45
Snowflake Wardance	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREMULT:2,[PRESKILL:1,Perform (Dance)=6],[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music]	DESC:Use bardic music skill and add +%1 to attack roll with slashing weapon for %2 rounds.  Must not wear medium armor, heavy armor, or carry a shield.  Will be fatigued for 10 minutes.|CHA|SKILLRANK=Perform {Dance}	SOURCEPAGE:p.50	BENEFIT:By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you may perform a deadly style of combat known as the snowflake wardance. Activating a snowflake wardance is a free action, and once activated, you add your Charisma modifier to your attack rolls with any slashing melee weapon you wield in one hand. This bonus to hit stacks with any bonuses you get from a high Strength score (or Dexterity score, if you are using Weapon Finesse). You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a shield, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load. A snowflake wardance lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Perform (dance). Performing a snowflake wardance is physically tiresome - when the snowflake wardance ends, you become fatigued for the next 10 minutes.

Cold Endurance		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:Either because of growing up in a frostfell or training your body and mind to ignore the biting effect of cold, you can exist with ease in low-temperature environments.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Base Fortitude save bonus +2.	PRECHECKBASE:1,Fortitude=2	BENEFIT: You can exist comfortably in conditions between 0° F and 90° F without having to make Fortitude saves (as described in Cold Dangers, page 8). You also gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against cold effects. Cold Endurance doesn’t provide any level of resistance to cold damage.

Frozen Berserker		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:When you enter your barbarian rage, your body becomes infused with cold energy.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to rage.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=Rage,TYPE=Frenzy	BENEFIT: As long as you are under the effects of a barbarian rage, you gain the cold subtype. You gain immunity to cold, but have vulnerability to fire, which means you take half again as much (+50%%) damage as normal from fi re, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.
