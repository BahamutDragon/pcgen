###Block: Feats
Armor Of Scales			SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Ceremony	DESC:You imbue a target with the protection of a dragon’s hide.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Dragonblood subtype, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks.	BENEFIT:You gain access to ceremonies based on your ranks in Knowledge (religion). Each ceremony provides up to four participants with a minor natural armor bonus. The ceremony takes 30 minutes and requires you to mark defensive runes upon the arms and torso of each participant with ash from a burned wooden shield of particular quality (see below). The effect of each ceremony lasts for 24 hours. The natural armor bonus gained from this ceremony feat doesn’t stack with a creature’s existing natural armor bonus; use only the higher value. Wyrmling Scales (4 ranks): Each participant gains a +1 natural armor bonus. This ceremony requires the ashes from a wooden shield of any size. Adult Scales (12 ranks): Each participant gains a +2 natural armor bonus. This ceremony requires the ashes from a masterwork wooden shield of any size. Wyrm Scales (18 ranks): Each participant gains a +3 natural armor bonus. This ceremony requires the ashes from a +1 (or higher) wooden shield of any size.
Black Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You have attuned yourself to your black dragon ancestry and can poison foes with your touch.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage (black), sorcerer level 3rd.	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can convert an arcane spell slot into a dangerous poison that you deliver by touch. At any time before the end of the same turn in which you activate this ability, you can make a melee touch attack as a swift action. The poison renders the target fatigued and deals 1d8 points of damage per level of the spell slot converted; 10 rounds later, the same effect repeats. Each time, a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the spell slot’s level + your Cha modifi er) negates the fatigue and halves the damage.
Blue Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.15	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You have learned to harness the powers of your blue dragon ancestry and can hurl orbs of lightning.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage (blue), sorcerer level 3rd.	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can convert an arcane spell slot into a number of orbs of lightning equal to the spell’s level, which immediately fl y toward the targets you designate. Each orb has a range of 30 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. On a successful hit, each orb deals a number of points of electricity damage equal to 1d6 + your Cha modifi er. You can direct any number of orbs at any target within range, all of them at the same target if desired.
Brass Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You have unlocked the power of your brass dragon ancestry and can put foes to sleep with ease.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage (brass), sorcerer level 3rd.	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can spend an arcane spell slot to cause a living creature within 30 feet to fall asleep for 1 round. A successful Will save (DC 10 + the spell slot’s level + your Cha modifi er) negates the effect. If the creature’s Hit Dice equals or exceeds three times the spell slot’s level, the effect automatically fails.
Bronze Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You have tapped into your bronze dragon blood and can channel arcane energy to repel foes.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage (bronze), sorcerer level 3rd.	BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can spend an arcane spell slot to force nearby enemies to move away from you. Each opponent within 30 feet of you must begin its next turn by moving at least 5 feet (1 square) away from you. The direction of movement doesn’t matter, as long as it takes the foe farther from you than the square in which it started. Unless the enemy designates the movement as a 5-foot step, this movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A successful Will save (DC 10 + the spell slot’s level + your Cha modifier) negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect.
Copper Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You have learned to channel the powers of your copper dragon ancestry to hinder your enemies’ mobility.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage (copper), sorcerer level 3rd.

BENEFIT:When you select this feat, choose a draconic aura (see page 86). You can project this aura as a swift action. Its benefi t applies to you and to all allies within 30 feet. The bonus of your draconic aura is +1. The aura remains in effect until you dismiss it (a free action), you are rendered unconscious or dead, or you activate another draconic aura in its place. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype, the bonus of your draconic aura improves with your class level. The aura grants a +2 bonus at 7th level, a +3 bonus at 14th level, and a +4 bonus at 20th level. You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, you gain the ability to project another aura of your choice (but not more than one aura at a time).

Half-dragons must choose the same dragon kind as their dragon parent. When you declare your draconic heritage, you gain a bonus on saving throws against magic sleep and paralysis effects, as well as on saves against spells and abilities with a descriptor that matches the corresponding energy type.

Dragonfire Assault		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You can augment your most powerful melee attacks with draconic power.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Str 13, Cha 11, dragonblood subtype, Power Attack.	BENEFIT:When you use Power Attack to increase the damage dealt from your attack, you can choose for the extra damage to be of the fire type instead of its normal type. Make this choice for each attack after it is resolved but before damage is dealt. This is a supernatural ability. Special: If you have the Draconic Heritage feat or if you are a half-dragon, the extra damage is of the energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that corresponds to your heritage or your draconic parent instead. If your feat or your parent is not associated with one of these energy types, this feat has no effect for you.
Dragonfire Channeling		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Divine.Draconic	DESC:You channel draconic fire through your holy symbol.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Cha 11, dragonblood subtype, ability to turn or rebuke undead or elementals.	BENEFIT:You can spend a turn or rebuke undead attempt or a turn or rebuke elementals attempt as a standard action to create a 15-foot cone of fire that deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 cleric levels (minimum 1d6 points). A successful Refl ex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Cha modifi er) halves this damage. Half of this damage is fire, while the remainder is sacred damage (to which resistance or immunity to fire does not apply). If your effective cleric level for the purpose of turning or rebuking is higher than your actual cleric level (for instance, if you are a paladin), use that value instead. Special: If you have the Draconic Heritage feat or if you are a half-dragon, the extra damage is of the energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that corresponds to your heritage or your draconic parent instead. If your feat or your parent is not associated with one of these energy types, this feat has no effect for you.
Dragonfire Inspiration		SOURCEPAGE:p.17	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You can channel the power of your draconic ancestry into the attacks of your allies.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Cha 11, dragonblood subtype, bardic music.	BENEFIT:When you use your bardic music to inspire courage, you can choose to imbue your allies with dragonfi re. This choice is made when first activating the ability, and the choice applies to all allies affected. Each ally so inspired loses the standard morale bonus on weapon attack rolls and damage rolls. Instead, he deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage with his weapons for every point of morale bonus that your inspire courage ability would normally add to the attack roll. For example, an 8th-level bard using this ability would add 2d6 points of fire damage to his allies’ attacks. Special: If you have the Draconic Heritage feat or if you are a half-dragon, the extra damage is of the energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that corresponds to your heritage or your draconic parent instead. If your feat or your parent is not associated with one of these energy types, this feat has no effect for you.
Dragonfire Strike			SOURCEPAGE:p.18	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You can call upon your innate draconic power to augment certain weapon attacks.

BENEFIT:When you gain extra damage from a sneak attack, sudden strike, or skirmish, you can choose for the extra damage to be fire damage. If you apply this effect, increase the extra damage dealt by 1d6 points. Make this choice for each attack after it is resolved but before damage is dealt. This is a supernatural ability. Special: If you have the Draconic Heritage feat or if you are a half-dragon, the extra damage is of the energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that corresponds to your heritage or your draconic parent instead. If your feat or your parent is not associated with one of these energy types, this feat has no effect for you.
Dragontouched			SOURCEPAGE:p.18	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a trace of draconic power, a result of dragons in your ancestry or a spiritual connection between you and the forces of dragonkind.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Cha 11.	BENEFIT:You gain the dragonblood subtype.

Gold Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:You can harness the legacy of your gold dragon ancestry to protect your allies.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage (gold), sorcerer level 3rd.	BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can spend an arcane spell slot to create a lucky aura that protects your allies. All allies within 30 feet (including you) gain a luck bonus equal to the spell slot’s level that they can apply on any one saving throw as an immediate action. This bonus must be used within a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1 round), or it is lost. An affected ally need not remain within 30 feet of you to use this bonus. No character can have more than one luck bonus from this feat at a time. If the feat is used a second time while the first use is still active, the new duration replaces the previous one unless the character chooses to retain the previous duration (for instance, if it were from a higher-level spell slot).
Green Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:Your link to your green dragon ancestors allows you to weaken the wills of others.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Draconic Heritage (green), sorcerer level 3rd.

The penalty is equal to the spell slot’s level and lasts until the creature attempts a Will save against an effect that is not harmless or until the end of your next turn, whichever comes first. Multiple uses of this ability don’t stack. This is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion).
Heart Of Dragons			SOURCEPAGE:p.19	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Ceremony	DESC:You imbue your allies with draconic power.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Dragonblood subtype, any draconic feat, Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks.	BENEFIT:You gain access to ceremonies based on your ranks in Knowledge (religion).

This ceremony requires diamond dust worth 50 gp. Soul of Dragons (8 ranks): Each participant in the ceremony gains the benefi t of one draconic feat for which he meets the prerequisite. The benefi t doesn’t allow a character to meet any other requirement or prerequisite (such as qualifying for another feat). This ceremony requires diamond dust worth 500 gp.

BENEFIT:You gain access to ceremonies based on your ranks in Knowledge (religion). Each ceremony allows you to provide up to five allies with defenses against dragons.

All participants stand in a circle facing inward and together hold the torch. The effect of each ceremony lasts for 24 hours. Stand Together (4 ranks): You draw forth the courage of all the would-be hunters so that all might share it. When facing a creature that has frightful presence, each participant can treat his Hit Dice (for the purpose of determining the frightful presence’s effectiveness) as 1 higher for each other participant in the ceremony who is within 60 feet of him. This ritual requires special herbs and incenses worth 20 gp. Stand Apart (8 ranks): You chant a litany of freedom, snuffi ng the torch in water at the end of the ceremony. All participants gain a +2 bonus on saves against breath weapons as long as at least one other participant in the ceremony is within 60 feet but not in the area of the same breath weapon. This ritual requires special herbs and incenses worth 100 gp. Stand Alone (13 ranks): You chant a litany of devotion as each participant passes a hand over the torch fl ame.

White Dragon Lineage		SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Draconic	DESC:Your veins run with the savage blood of white dragons, allowing you to whip yourself into a ragelike state.

The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + your Charisma bonus.
Words Of Draconic Power		SOURCEPAGE:p.22	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Ceremony	DESC:You tap into the great tradition of draconic magic to enhance the words of your allies.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Speak Language (Draconic).	BENEFIT:You gain access to ceremonies based on your ranks in Knowledge (religion). Each ceremony requires 5 minutes, but their forms vary as described below. Each ceremony can affect up to six individuals, and the effects last for 24 hours. Ancient Tongue (4 ranks): Using a tindertwig, you burn dragon runes onto a piece of bread (one per participant) and place it on the participant’s tongue, thereby sharing your knowledge of the ancient language of dragons. Each participant gains the ability to speak and understand the Draconic language. Potent Words (8 ranks): You write mystic incantations on a fl ask of alchemist’s fire (one per participant), making it safe to consume. Each participant then drinks the contents of the fl ask. When a participant casts a language-dependent spell, his caster level is increased by 1. Participants also gain a +1 bonus on saves against language-dependent spells. Arcane Syllables (14 ranks): You scribe a single draconic rune on a pearl worth at least 1,000 gp (one per participant), which is consumed by the participant. At any one time during the next 24 hours, the participant can choose to activate the ceremony’s power as an immediate action. This has one of two effects, chosen by the participant. • If the character is being subjected to a power word spell, he can treat his current hit points as twice their actual number for the purpose of determining the effect of the spell. For example, a character with 55 hit points who activated this ability in response to a power word kill spell would be unaffected by the spell (since he would effectively have 110 hit points). • If the character is capable of casting a power word spell (that is, he either has such a spell prepared, or he knows one and has a spell slot available to cast it), he can cast that power word spell with no additional action required. Doing this expends the prepared spell or spell slot as normal.
