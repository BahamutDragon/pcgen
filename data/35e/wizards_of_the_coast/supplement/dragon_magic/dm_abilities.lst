# Fireblood Dwarf
# -Dragonblood Subtype: Fireblood dwarves are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4).
# -Dragon Dodge: Fireblood dwarves gain a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the dragon type. In memory of their ancestors, fireblood dwarves train from an early age to avoid surprise attacks from treacherous dragons. Any time a fireblood dwarf loses his Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when he is caught flat-footed, he loses this dodge bonus, too.
# -Resistance to Fire 5: Fireblood dwarves have an exceptional tolerance for heat and fire, inherited from their enslaved forefathers.
# -Fireblood dwarves do not have the standard dwarf +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. The environment of their ancestors was free of such subtle means of attack, so fireblood dwarves are no more resistant to poison than other races.
# -Fireblood dwarves do not have the standard dwarf's +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type.
# 
# 
# # 8
# Forestlord		TYPE:Elf Subrace.Half-Elf Subrace
# -Dragonblood Subtype: Forestlord elves and half-elves are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4).
# -Treewalk (Su): A forestlord elf or half-elf can transport herself between trees in much the same way that dryads and druids can. Once per day, a forestlord elf can enter a tree by touching it as a move action; once inside the tree, she instantly transports to any other tree within 60 feet. The forestlord elf appears in a square adjacent to the second tree at the beginning of her next turn. When a forestlors elf or half-elf reaches 5 Hit Dice, and for every 5 HD thereafter, she gains one additional use of this ability per day.
# -Class Skills: Hide is a class skill for forestlord elves and half-elves.
# -No bonus on saves against enchantment spells or effects. A costly part of the ancient pacts required the elves to forgo their innate resistance to enchantments.
# -Forestlord elves do not have proficiency with the longsword, rapier, longbow, or shortbow. They spend more time communing with nature and less time practicing with these traditional weapons.
# -Forestlord half-elves have no bonus on Diplomacy or Gather Information checks. Cooperation comes less naturally to these characters.
# -Forestlord Pact: Any forestlord elf or half-elf who attacks or otherwise attempts to harm a green dragon loses her treewalk ability for 24 hours. During that time, the character also takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, caster level or manifester level, and saving throws.
# -Favored Class: Sorcerer. A multiclass forestlord elf or half-elf's sorcerer class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty (see XP for Multiclass Characters, PH 60). This class replaces the standard elf's favored class, wizard.
# 
# # 9
# Stonehunter Gnome
# -Dragonblood Subtype: Stonehunter gnomes are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4).
# -Hunter's Insight: As frequent hunting companions of great copper dragons, stonehunter gnomes quickly develop the skills necessary to track down their prey. They have a +2 racial bonus on Climb and Survival checks as a result of their upbringing.
# -Stonehunter gnomes do not have the standard gnome's +2 saving throw bonus against illusions, nor do they add +1 to the Difficulty Class of illusion spells they cast. Stonehunter gnomes care little for illusions and instead spend the majority of their time honing their hunting skills.
# -Favored Class: Ranger. A multiclass stonehunter gnome's ranger class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty (see XP for Multiclass Characters, PH 60). This class replaces the standard gnome's favored class, bard.
# 
# Glimmerskin Halflings
# -Dragonblood Subtype: Glimmerskin halflings are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4).
# -Touch of Luck: Once per day, a glimmerskin halfling can grant himself or any ally within 30 feet a +2 luck bonus on a single saving throw. Using this ability is an immediate action and must be announced before the roll is made.
# -Class Skills: Heal is a class skill for glimmerskin halflings.
# -No Move Silently Bonus: Glimmerskin halflings don't share the standard halfling's penchant for stealth.
# 
# Viletooth Lizardfolk
# - +2 Constitution: A viletooth lizardfolk is less muscular than other lizardfolk but inherits some of a black dragon's cunning. This ability score modifier replaces the standard lizardfolk ability score modifiers.
# -Dragonblood Subtype: Viletooth lizardfolk are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4).
# -Acid Bite (Su): A viletooth lizardfolk's bite attack deals 1d6 points of acid damage in addition to its normal damage.
# -Water Breathing (Ex): Viletooth lizardfolk can breathe underwater indefinitely.
# -Class Skills: Move Silently is a class skill for viletooth lizardfolk.
# -No Hold Breath Special Quality: Viletooth lizardfolk don't share the standard lizardfolk's ability to hold its breath longer than normal.
# 
# # 10
# SUNSCORCH HOBGOBLIN
# - +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom: Sunscorch hobgoblins display exceptional insight and share their fellows' toughness, but they aren't as agile as standard hobgoblins. These ability score modifiers replace the standard hobgoblin ability score modifiers.
# -Dragonblood Subtype: Sunscorch hobgoblins are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4).
# -Sunscorch hobgoblins have a +2 racial bonus on Bluff checks because of their natural ability to deceive their enemies.
# -Sunscorch hobgoblins are inured to the environmental hazards of the blue dragons' home. They have a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid nonlethal damage from heat (see Heat Dangers, DMG 303).
# 
# Frostblood Orc/Half-Orc
# -Dragonblood Subtype: Frostblood orcs and half-orcs are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4).
# -Resistance to Cold 10: Because their ancestors ingested the blood of great white dragons, all frostblood orcs and half-orcs are naturally resistant to damage from cold-based attacks.
# -Endurance: Frostblood orcs and half-orcs have Endurance as a bonus feat. If a frostblood orc or half-orc would later gain Endurance as a bonus feat, he can select any other feat for which he qualifies.
# -Vulnerability to Fire: Frostblood orcs and half-orcs share the white dragon's vulnerability to fire-based attacks.

###Block: ALTERNATIVE CLASS FEATURE	11
Aspect of the Dragon	CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.11		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Druid=5	TYPE:Druid.DruidWildShape		DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wild shape (or any later improvements to that class feature, except for the ability to wild shape into an elemental). Benefit: You can take on aspects of dragonkind. Taking on one or more aspects is a swift action, and the effect lasts for 1 hour or until you dismiss it (a free action). The various aspects are described below. At 5th level, you can have only one aspect in effect at a time. At 8th level, you can take on up to two aspects simultaneously. At 11th level, you can take on up to three aspects simultaneously. At 15th level, the limit increases to its maximum of four simultaneous aspects. Each aspect taken on counts as one daily use of the ability (see below). Multiple versions of the same aspect don't stack. At 5th level, you can use this ability once per day. You gain additional uses per day at the same rate that you would normally gain uses of wild shape (from two per day at 6th level up to six per day at 18th level). You are considered proficient with any natural attacks granted by the aspect, and you retain all your special abilities (unless the aspect specifically replaces them, such as the claws of the dragon aspect replacing your own claw attack, if you have one). Breath of the Dragon: You can breathe a 30-foot cone of fire as a standard action. The cone deals 1d6 points of damage per two druid levels; a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your druid level + your Con modifier) halves this damage. Each time you breathe, you must wait 1d4 rounds before you can use this breath weapon again. Claws of the Dragon: You gain a +4 bonus to Strength, and your hands grow claws that can be used as primary natural attacks. Each claw deals a certain amount of damage (1d6 points if you are Medium, 1d4 if you are Small, and 1d8 if you are Large) plus your Strength modifier. These claws are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Heart of the Dragon: You gain a +4 bonus to Constitution and immunity to paralysis. Mind of the Dragon: You gain a +4 bonus to Wisdom, darkvision out to 60 feet, low-light vision, and immunity to sleep effects. Wings of the Dragon: You grow draconic wings that allow you to fly at your land speed with good maneuverability. You can't fly if you are wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.
Breathstealer		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.11		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Rogue=10	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard rogue's special ability granted at that level. Benefit: If you deliver a sneak attack against a dragon, you can choose to sacrifice two or more dice of extra damage that you would normally deal to delay the creature's next use of its breath weapon. The delay is a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the number of dice sacrificed. If the dragon is currently recharging its breath weapon, this delay replaces the normal recharge time (usually once every 1d4 rounds) if it is longer. Multiple uses of this ability don't stack; use only the longer delay. A dragon immune to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks is immune to this ability.
Draconic Fist		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Monk=1	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard monk's bonus feat at 1st level. Benefit: When you select this class feature, choose one energy type from among acid, cold, electricity, or fire. As a swift action, you can choose for your next unarmed attack made in this round to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This extra damage improves to 2d6 points at 5th level, and by another 1d6 points every five levels thereafter. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your class level.
Dragonscale Husk		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PREPROFWITHARMOR:1,TYPE.Heavy,Plate	PRERACE:1,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain proficiency with any kind of armor. If you would later gain some form of armor proficiency (such as by multiclassing or taking a feat), you can choose at that time to gain that proficiency, but you then lose this class feature. If you already have proficiency with any kind of armor, you must lose that proficiency in order to select this class feature. Benefit: You gain the extraordinary ability to grow a thick, scaly hide that protects you like armor. The dragonscale husk resembles the scales of a dragon of your choice (selected when you gain the class feature). The husk requires 8 hours to grow, but this process can take place at night while you are sleeping. Your scaled hide grants you a bonus to your Armor Class equal to 6 + 1/3 your class level in the class that granted you heavy armor proficiency (+7 bonus to AC at 3rd level, +8 bonus to AC at 6th level, and so on, up to a maximum +12 bonus to AC at 18th level). Multiple classes that grant this profi- ciency stack for determining the dragonscale husk's total bonus. This bonus doesn't stack with any feat, racial trait, or other special ability that would grant you a bonus to Armor Class. In addition, as you attain higher levels, your husk grants you increasing resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. You gain resistance 5 at 5th level, resistance 10 at 10th level, resistance 15 at 15th level, and resistance 20 at 20th level. Your dragonscale husk is treated as medium armor for the purpose of determining your speed and whether you can use class features or other special abilities. It allows a maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class of +2 and has an armor check penalty of -4. You can sleep in your husk without penalty. You cannot wear any other armor while your husk is present. Your husk isn't treated as armor for the purpose of being affected by spells or other abilities. You can't grant it an enhancement bonus with magic vestment, nor can you imbue it with special properties, as you could a normal suit of armor. You can't take off your dragonscale husk, but you can choose to shed it. Doing this requires 10 minutes of concentration and results in your sloughing off a pile of scales that crumble to dust if handled.
Drakken Familiar		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Hexblade=4,sorcerer=1,wizard=1	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, your familiar does not gain all the benefits normally accorded to a familiar. See below to determine which alternative benefits it gains, and which standard benefits these replace. Benefit: Your familiar is a drakken version of a normal animal (see the sidebar on page 107). It gains the dragonblood subtype and all the benefits of being a familiar, except as described below. When your familiar would normally gain the ability to deliver touch spells, it gains a breath weapon instead. This breath is a 15-foot cone of fire, usable once per hour, that deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + twice your class level (levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for this purpose). A successful Reflex save (10 + 1/2 your total class levels for determining the familiar's abilities) halves the damage dealt. When your familiar would normally gain the ability to speak with animals of its kind, it instead gains the ability to speak with creatures of the dragon type.
Drakkensteed Mount	CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Paladin=5	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard paladin's special mount. Benefit: You gain the service of a loyal drakkensteed. It functions in all ways as any other special mount gained by a paladin (including advancing its statistics, gaining special abilities, and so forth), except that it can't command animals.
Favored of Bahamut	CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Favored Soul=3	PREDEITY:1,Bahamut	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the Weapon Focus feat with your deity's favored weapon at 3rd level, and you do not gain the Weapon Specialization feat with your deity's favored weapon at 12th level. Furthermore, other class features gained at later levels change, as described below. Benefit: You grow claws that deal damage (1d6 points if you are Medium, 1d4 if you are Small, and 1d8 if you are Large). As a full attack, you can make one primary natural attack with each of your two extremities, or you can make one secondary natural attack with one claw when attacking with a melee weapon. The claws are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, you can choose a sorcerer spell (rather than a cleric spell) as your newly learned 1st-level spell. As long as the spell remains on your list of spells known, you can treat it as being on your class spell list for all purposes. You also gain the Dragontouched feat (page 18) as a bonus feat. At 12th level, you can learn one additional sorcerer spell as if it were a cleric spell. This spell can be one of your newly learned 5th- or 6th-level spells, or you can use your ability to replace an existing known spell with a new sorcerer spell. At 17th level, instead of growing batlike or feathered wings, you grow draconic wings that resemble those of your deity. At 20th level, instead of gaining damage reduction 10/silver or 10/cold iron, you gain damage reduction 10/epic.
Favored of Tiamat		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Favored Soul=3	PREDEITY:1,Tiamat	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the Weapon Focus feat with your deity's favored weapon at 3rd level, and you do not gain the Weapon Specialization feat with your deity's favored weapon at 12th level. Furthermore, other class features gained at later levels change, as described below. Benefit: You grow claws that deal damage (1d6 points if you are Medium, 1d4 if you are Small, and 1d8 if you are Large). As a full attack, you can make one primary natural attack with each of your two extremities, or you can make one secondary natural attack with one claw when attacking with a melee weapon. The claws are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, you can choose a sorcerer spell (rather than a cleric spell) as your newly learned 1st-level spell. As long as the spell remains on your list of spells known, you can treat it as being on your class spell list for all purposes. You also gain the Dragontouched feat (page 18) as a bonus feat. At 12th level, you can learn one additional sorcerer spell as if it were a cleric spell. This spell can be one of your newly learned 5th- or 6th-level spells, or you can use your ability to replace an existing known spell with a new sorcerer spell. At 17th level, instead of growing batlike or feathered wings, you grow draconic wings that resemble those of your deity. At 20th level, instead of gaining damage reduction 10/silver or 10/cold iron, you gain damage reduction 10/epic.
Inspire Awe			CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Bard=1		DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain inspire courage (or any later improvements to that class feature). Benefit: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire awe in his enemies, rendering them shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and be able to hear the bard perform. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the bard perform and for 1 round thereafter. Each enemy can attempt a Will save to negate the effect; the DC is equal to the bard's Perform check result. Regardless of the success or failure of the save, no creature can be affected by inspire awe more than once in a 24-hour period. Inspire awe is a mind-affecting fear effect. At 8th level, the range of this effect extends to 60 feet. At 14th level, the effect lasts for 5 rounds after the enemy can no longer hear the bard perform. At 20th level, any enemy who fails to save becomes frightened for 1 round, then shaken for the remainder of the duration.
Phynxkin Companion	CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Druid=1,Ranger=4	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you give up your standard choice of animal companion, and your animal companion does not gain all benefits normally accorded to it (see below). Benefit: You gain a phynxkin as an animal companion. Treat it as an animal for the purpose of determining the effects of your skills, feats, spells, and other abilities. When your phynxkin would normally gain the devotion special quality, both you and the phynxkin instead gain immunity to fear effects, but only while you are within 30 feet of each other. When your effective druid level for determining your animal companion's abilities reaches 7th, you can replace your animal companion with a dire phynxkin animal companion (see page 117). Doing this reduces your effective druid level for determining its abilities by six.
Rebuke Dragons		CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Cleric=1,Paladin=4	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead. Benefit: You channel divine energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) dragons. This ability functions as an evil cleric rebuking undead. It is more difficult to rebuke or command dragons that share your moral or ethical bent. Any dragon that shares one alignment component with you is treated as having turn resistance +2 against this ability. Any dragon that shares both alignment components with you is treated as having turn resistance +4 against this ability. You can also use this ability to bolster a dragon against an attempt by another creature to use its own rebuke dragons ability (the same way an evil cleric can bolster undead against turning). To bolster a dragon, you must share at least one alignment component with the dragon. An attempt to rebuke dragons counts as an attempt to turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for or activating divine feats, or for using other abilities that require you to expend a use of your turn or rebuke ability.
Shamanic Invocation	CATEGORY:ACF	SOURCEPAGE:p.12		TYPE:ACF	PRECLASS:1,Dragon shaman=5	DESC:Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not learn a new draconic aura at 5th level (and can never know more than six draconic auras, at 9th level and higher). Benefit: You learn one of the least draconic invocations (see page 78) available to dragonfire adepts.

Frightful Presence	KEY:Aspect of Bahamut ~ Frightful Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Aspect of Bahamut Race Trait.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:An aspect of Bahamut can inspire terror by charging, attacking, or flying overhead. Creatures within 120 feet of the dragon that have 11 HD or fewer must attempt a DC 22 Will save. Success indicates that the target is immune to the aspect's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds. Those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.
Breath Weapon		KEY:Aspect of Bahamut ~ Breath Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Aspect of Bahamut Race Trait.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once every 1d4 rounds, 40-ft. cone, 12d6 cold, Reflex DC 24 half.
Tempest Breath		KEY:Aspect of Bahamut ~ Tempest Breath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Aspect of Bahamut Race Trait.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:When an aspect of Bahamut chooses to use this feat (see Draconomicon) in conjunction with its breath weapon, creatures in the area that fail a DC 18 Fortitude save are affected as by a windstorm (DMG 95) in adddition to taking normal damage. Because the breath weapon has an instantaneous duration, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6x5 feet). If an aspect uses this ability, it adds 1 to the number of rounds it must wait before using its breath weapon again.

The save DC is 14 or 13 + your Cha modifier, whichever is higher.
Dragonbane			KEY:Wyrmbane Helm ~ Dragonbane		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:Starting at 10th level, you are anathema to dragons of all kinds. Any melee weapon you wield gains a +2 enhancement bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage when you attack a creature of the dragon type. This benefit doesn't stack with the bane weapon special ability. In addition, any spell you cast that deals damage to a dragon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to that dragon. If the spell allows a saving throw, the DC of the saving throw increases by 2. A successful save either halves or negates the extra damage, depending on how the normal damage dealt by the spell is affected by a successful save. A single spell can never deal this extra damage more than once per casting. However, if a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals the extra damage in each round.
Blindsense			KEY:Wyrmbane Helm ~ Blindsense		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:Starting at 12th level, you gain blindsense out to 30 feet as long as you wear the Wyrmbane Helm.

You can use this ability three times per day.
Frightful Presence	KEY:Wyrmbane Helm ~ Frightful Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:When you charge, attack, or cast a spell while wearing the helm, your frightful presence might affect enemies within 30 feet who have fewer Hit Dice than you. Creatures of 4 or fewer Hit Dice become panicked for 1 minute, and creatures of 5 or more Hit Dice become shaken for 1 minute. A successful Will save (DC 17 or 15 + your Cha modifier, whichever is higher) negates either effect. Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, the creature is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. Dragons are immune to your frightful presence regardless of their Hit Dice.
Immune to Electricity	KEY:Wyrmbane Helm ~ Immune to Electricity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:Starting at 18th level, you are immune to electricity damage as long as you wear the Wyrmbane Helm.

It deals 2d6 extra points of damage with its melee attacks when it hits the foe who last damaged it with a melee attack in the previous round. If no enemy damaged the redspawn berserker with a melee attack since before its last turn, this extra damage doesn't apply.



Devour Spell	KEY:Spelleater ~ Devour Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Spelleater Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.119	DESC:Any time a character casts a spell on a spelleater and does not overcome its spell resistance, the spelleater converts that spell energy into a boost for its own natural abilities. When a spelleater's spell resistance blocks an incoming spell, the creature selects and gains one of the following benefits, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell. Multiple applications of the same benefit do not stack; instead, if the spelleater chooses the same benefit again before the first duration has elapsed, use the longer of the two durations. Combat Boost: The spelleater gains a +2 bonus on its melee attack rolls and damage rolls. Damage Reduction: The spelleater gains DR 5/ adamantine. Fast Healing: The spelleater gains fast healing 10. Magic Dampening: The spelleater generates a magicdampening field, causing all spellcasters within 60 feet to take a -2 penalty to their caster level.


###Block: Dragonfire Adept
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Dragonfire Adept ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonfire Adept Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:Dragonfire adepts are proficient with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields. Like arcane spellcasters, a dragonfire adept wearing armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (all invocations have somatic components).
Invocations				KEY:Dragonfire Adept ~ Invocations				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonfire Adept Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:A dragonfire adept has a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and other abilities known as draconic invocations, which allow her to focus the draconic energy that suffuses her soul. A dragonfire adept can use any invocation she knows at will. A dragonfire adept's invocations are spell-like abilities; using an invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. To avoid provoking such attacks, a dragonfire adept can use an invocation defensively by making a successful Concentration check. An invocation can be disrupted, just as a spell can be ruined during casting. If a dragonfire adept is hit by an attack while invoking, she is entitled to a Concentration check to successfully use the invocation, just as a spellcaster would be. Her invocations are subject to spell resistance unless an invocation's description specifically states otherwise. A dragonfire adept's caster level with her invocations is equal to her class level. She can dismiss any invocation as a standard action, just as a wizard can dismiss a spell. If an invocation allows a saving throw, its DC is 10 + the equivalent spell level + the dragonfire adept's Cha modifier. Since spell-like abilities are not spells, a dragonfire adept cannot benefit from the Spell Focus feat or from draconic feats that let her convert or spend an arcane spell slot to produce some other effect. She can, however, benefit from the Ability Focus feat (MM 303), as well as from feats that emulate metamagic effects for spell-like abilities. The four grades of draconic invocations, in order of their relative power, are least, lesser, greater, and dark. A 1st-level dragonfire adept begins with knowledge of one least invocation, gaining access to more invocations and higher grades as she attains levels. At any level when a dragonfire adept learns a new invocation, she can also replace an invocation she already knows with another invocation of the same or lower grade. See Draconic Invocations, below, for a list of available invocations. Unlike other spell-like abilities, draconic invocations are subject to arcane spell failure chance as described under Weapon and Armor Proficiency, above. Finally, just like warlocks (see Complete Arcane), dragonfire adepts can qualify for some prestige classes usually intended for spellcasters. For details, see the Dragonfire Adepts and Prestige Classes sidebar on page 24.

Breath Weapon			KEY:Dragonfire Adept ~ Breath Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonfire Adept Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.25	DESC:At 1st level, you gain a breath weapon that you can use at will as a standard action. Each time you use your breath weapon, you can choose whether it takes the form of a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of fire damage; a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Con modifier) halves the damage. As you gain levels, your breath weapon's damage increases, as shown on Table 2-1. You are immune to the effect of your own breath weapon (but not to other breath weapons that produce similar effects, even those of other dragonfire adepts). At 10th level, your cone-shaped breath weapon's range doubles to 30 feet, and your line-shaped breath weapon's range doubles to 60 feet.

Breath Effect			KEY:Dragonfire Adept ~ Breath Effect			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonfire Adept Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.26	DESC:At 2nd, 5th, 10th, 12th, 15th, and 20th level, you can select one of the breath effects in Table 2-2: Dragonfire Adept Breath Effects for which you meet the minimum level prerequisite. These breath effects can alter your breath weapon's damage type or area, or apply a condition to targets in place of damage. Each time you use your breath weapon, you can choose to apply any one breath effect that you know. The chosen effect either replaces the normal fire damage dealt by your breath weapon or replaces the standard area of your breath weapon. Some effects can be applied only to a cone-shaped breath weapon, and others only to a line-shaped breath weapon. You can't apply more than one breath effect to your breath weapon unless the effect specifically states otherwise. Also, you can't apply the same breath effect to your breath weapon in two consecutive rounds (though you still can use your normal fire breath weapon every round). See page 77 in Chapter 3: Draconic Magic for full descriptions of the breath effects.		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Dragonfire Adept Breath Effect|1+(DragonfireAdeptLVL/5)+(DragonfireAdeptLVL>=12)
