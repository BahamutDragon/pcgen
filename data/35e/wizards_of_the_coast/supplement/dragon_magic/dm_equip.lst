In addition, if the wearer casts any spells or spell-like abilities with the fear descriptor, the amulet increases their save DC by 2.

He must hold the rod in one hand and utter the command word (a standard action), which is often an ancient dragon's name, such as "Paelchronithrax" or "Tueranachtrus." The rod is active for a maximum of 10 rounds per day, split up however the wielder likes. He can turn off the rod with a mental command (a free action). While the rod is active, if the wielder's current hit points fall below half his full normal hit points, the rod immediately turns off. Effect: Enemies within 30 feet of the wielder when he activates the rod (or who come within 30 feet of an already active rod) must attempt DC 16 Will saves. Foes who fail their saves are shaken as long as they remain within 120 feet of the rod. Foes who make their saves are immune to the effects of the rod of the dragon heart for 24 hours. Creatures immune to a dragon's frightful presence are immune to the rod's effect. Aura/Caster Level: Moderate necromancy; CL 7th.
