Adoration Of The Frightful							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Hexblade=2|Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=3									SCHOOL:Enchantment			SUBSCHOOL:Charm		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting			COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:60 ft.		TARGETAREA:60-ft. radius emanation, centered on you							DURATION:1 minute/level							SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes			BONUS:SKILL|Diplomacy|1|TYPE=Competence									SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:A thunderous rumble echoes from within you, washing over cowed creatures and forcing them to show you respect. Upon casting this spell, you radiate a magical aura that causes fearful creatures to shy away from harming you. While this spell is in effect, any creature within the spell's area that is shaken, frightened, or panicked has its attitude toward you shifted to friendly (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, PH 72). This effect ends for a given creature if the fear effect is removed, or if you or an ally attacks the creature or otherwise takes any hostile act toward it. Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks.
Arcane Spellsurge									TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard,Wu Jen=7												SCHOOL:Universal															COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:Green and yellow sparks fly off your body as a light breeze picks up, lifting loose debris and swirling around with a faint howl. This spell speeds the flow of magic through you, hastening your spellcasting ability. Casting times for arcane spells are reduced as follows: Normal New Casting Time Casting Time 1 standard action 1 swift action 1 full round 1 standard action 2-10 rounds 1 round less than normal Arcane spellsurge has no effect on any spell with a casting time of greater than 1 minute or a casting time not listed on the table. You can't choose to ignore this effect; that is, you can't opt to cast a spell using its normal casting time. Thus, if all your spells normally have casting times of 1 standard action, they take 1 swift action instead, and because you can't take more than one swift action in a round, you won't be able to cast multiple spells per round while under the effect of arcane spellsurge. (If you have available spells with casting times of 1 full round, you are still able to cast more than one of those spells per round.) However, a Sorcerer or other spontaneous arcane caster could cast a metamagic spell (as a standard action) and a normal spell (as a swift action) in the same round. This spell doesn't stack with any other effect that reduces a spell's casting time. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you can cast this spell as a swift action.
Aspect Of The Chromatic Dragon						TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer=8														SCHOOL:Transmutation			SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	DESCRIPTOR:Evil					COMPS:V, S, Evil	CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level (D)																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:Your body becomes powerfully muscled as multicolored scales cover your flesh. Four draconic heads sprout from your shoulders. You take the form of an aspect of Tiamat (see page 110). You gain 100 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration. For details, see The Polymorph Subschool on page 60. Evil: Only evil-aligned characters can cast this spell.
Aspect Of The Platinum Dragon							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer=7														SCHOOL:Transmutation			SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph	DESCRIPTOR:Good					COMPS:V, S, Good	CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level (D)																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:Your body expands in size while growing a sheen of platinum scales and mighty claws and teeth. A pair of great wings sprouts from your back. You take the form of an aspect of Bahamut (see page 108). You gain 110 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration. For details, see The Polymorph Subschool on page 60. (If you don't have access to Draconomicon, replace the aspect's Tempest Breath feat with Great Cleave.) Good: Only good-aligned characters can cast this spell.
Burst Of Glacial Wrath								TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=9													SCHOOL:Evocation|Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Cold					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:30 feet		TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst											DURATION:Instantaneous							SAVEINFO:Fortitude half					SPELLRES:Yes												BONUS:VAR|ColdResistanceBonus|5	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:A quick buildup of icy blue energy centered on your hand rapidly becomes an enormous bubble of frost that washes out over the landscape, freezing all in its path. You create a burst of icy energy that flash-freezes any creatures within the spell's area. The spell deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d6 points). Any living creature reduced to -1 or fewer hit points is not killed, but instead turned to solid ice (similar to flesh to stone, but with ice instead of stone). Effectively, the spell can't reduce a creature's hit points below -9. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage. A creature turned to solid ice by this spell gains hardness 10 as well as immunity to cold and electricity. However, it also gains vulnerability to fire, and any frozen creature reduced to -10 or fewer hit points by fire damage immediately melts (and dies). Once this occurs, the creature can be brought back to life only with a miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell. Special: A character who learns this spell gains resistance to cold 5, which stacks with any other resistance to cold he already possesses.
Call Of The Twilight Defender							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=6												SCHOOL:Conjuration			SUBSCHOOL:Summoning								COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 full round				RANGE:Close			TARGETAREA:One twilight guardian										DURATION:1 round/level							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No				BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (Nature)|1|TYPE=Competence							SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:The very ground erupts in a shower of stone and dirt, accompanied by a thunderclap. Standing in the center of the damaged ground is a creature of stone, wood, and plant parts resembling the regal form of a guardian dragon. This spell summons one twilight guardian (see page 121) to fight for you. The spell functions like a summon nature's ally spell, but with one exception. At any time, a summoned twilight guardian can sacrifice itself by simply touching you (a standard action); the twilight guardian is immediately destroyed, and you gain a number of hit points equal to 1/2 the twilight guardian's remaining hit points before its sacrifice. Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks.
Channel The Dragon								TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Wu Jen=7															SCHOOL:Transmutation														COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 full round				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:You feel the mighty force of elemental wyrms flood your spirit and reinforce your body. Your flesh hardens, and your eyes gleam. Few creatures represent both the mystic and the elemental more than dragons. You tap into the spiritual might of these magnificent creatures to gain a breath weapon and a defensive ability based on your favored element (and the dragon variety channeled by the spell). See the table below for details. The breath weapon takes the form of a 15-foot cone-shaped burst. Using the breath weapon requires a standard action, and each time you breathe, you must wait 1d4 rounds before breathing again. Spell resistance does not apply against the breath weapon's effect. Element Breath Defensive (Dragon) Weapon Ability Earth Slow, DR 5/ (copper) 1d6 rounds adamantine (Will negates) Fire (red) 7d6 fire Resistance to (Ref half) fire 30 Metal Paralysis, DR 5/ (silver) 1 round adamantine (Will negates) Water 7d6 cold Resistance to (white) (Ref half) cold 30 Wood 7d6 acid Resistance to (green) (Ref half) acid 30
Curse Of The Elemental Lords							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4													SCHOOL:Necromancy															COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Medium		TARGETAREA:One creature/4 levels										DURATION:24 hours								SAVEINFO:Will negates					SPELLRES:Yes																		SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:Ghostly images of elemental beasts fly from your outstretched arm, striking foes and placing a shadowy curse upon them. This spell places a curse on the targets, making them more susceptible to your magical attacks. When you cast this spell, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire; any creature affected by the spell takes an extra 1d6 points of damage from any of your spells that deal damage of that energy type. The extra damage isn't added to other effects, such as a weapon's flaming special ability, nor does it apply to damage dealt by other characters. As part of the casting of this spell, you can sacrifice one additional Sorcerer spell slot of up to 9th level; doing this increases the extra damage from the spell by 1 point per level of the sacrificed slot. For example, if you spend a 4th-level spell slot to cast curse of the elemental lords and a 6th-level spell slot to augment it, the resulting curse adds 1d6+6 points of damage to the damage taken by targets of your spells of the chosen energy type. Curse of the elemental lords can't be dispelled, but it can be removed by any effect that would remove a curse. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), the extra damage from this spell also applies to your breath weapon (assuming that it deals the appropriate type of damage).
Detect Dragonblood								TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1													SCHOOL:Divination															COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:60 ft.		TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped emanation										DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)			SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																			SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that you detect the auras of creatures of the dragon type or the dragonblood subtype (see page 4). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of dragonblooded creatures. 2nd Round: Number of dragonblooded in the area, and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, you learn its direction but not its exact location. If an aura is within your line of sight, you can make a Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 10 + target's HD) to determine whether the aura is of the dragon type or the dragonblood subtype. Aura Power: The power of a dragonblooded creature's aura depends on its Hit Dice and the strength of its connection to dragons; see the accompanying table. If a creature's aura falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.
Dragoneye Rune									TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard,Wu Jen=2												SCHOOL:Universal															COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.			DURATION:Permanent							SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:No																			SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A brightly glowing sigil appears briefly, burning as though branded into the surface before fading to invisibility. This spell allows you to brand a special arcane mark onto an object or creature, denoting that it is under your watchful eye. The mark inscribed is unique to your casting of this spell; no two casters create the same mark. It otherwise functions just as arcane mark, with two exceptions. First, you can treat the marked object or creature as familiar for the purpose of any divination (scrying) spell. Second, three times per day you can (as a swift action) detect the direction and distance of the marked object or creature from you. If the creature is dead or on another plane, you gain no knowledge from this function. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), any object or creature with a dragoneye rune gains a +2 bonus on saves against divination (scrying) spells or effects cast by other dragonblooded creatures.
Dragonshape, Least			KEY:Dragonshape (Least)		TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3													SCHOOL:Transmutation			SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph								COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level (D)																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Your body shrinks to the size of a housecat, as red-brown scales replace your normal skin and your fingers turn into sharp claws. A sinuous barbed tail grows from the base of your spine, and two leathery wings burst from your back. You take the form of a Tiny pseudodragon (MM 210). For details, see The Polymorph Subschool on page 60.
Dragonshape, Lesser			KEY:Dragonshape (Lesser)	TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6													SCHOOL:Transmutation			SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph								COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level (D)																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:You feel a fire burning deep within you. Crimson scales quickly grow over your body, a pair of great wings sprouts from your shoulders, and the scent of sulfur fills the air as you transform into a dragon. You take the form of a Large young red dragon (see below). You gain 60 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration. For details, see The Polymorph Subschool on page 60.
Eyes Of The Oracle								TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard,Wu Jen=6											SCHOOL:Divination															COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level or until expended																																SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Vague, translucent shadows of your body's form move just out of sync with your own motions, a visible sign that you exist in two places in time. You can see into the future, slightly anticipating your opponents' next moves. You gain a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class and a +2 insight bonus on Reflex saves. Additionally, at the end of your turn, you can ready a single standard action regardless of the number of actions taken this turn. Thus, you can move at your movement rate, make a single attack, and then at the end of your turn ready an action to cast a single spell with a casting time of one standard action. This behaves as a readied action in all other ways, including the change in your initiative. If you take the readied action, the spell's effect ends immediately. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), your bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves improves to +3.
Ferocity Of Sanguine Rage							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3|Assassin=4											SCHOOL:Transmutation|Divination												COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level or until expended																																SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Blood seems to pour from your eyes as an irregular red glow whirls around you chaotically. This spell imbues you with a supernatural ferocity, giving you an edge in melee combat. You gain a morale bonus on your melee damage rolls (with weapons or natural attacks) equal to 1/2 your caster level. This has no impact on your ability to cast spells or perform other actions. Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a true strike effect (as the spell) on yourself as a standard action. This effect lasts for the normal duration of the true strike spell (a single attack), after which the entire spell's duration ends. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you cast this spell at +1 caster level.
Firestride Exhalation								TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4	CLASSES:Wu Jen=4										SCHOOL:Conjuration|Evocation		SUBSCHOOL:Teleportation	DESCRIPTOR:Fire					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:30 ft.; see text	TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst; see text									DURATION:Instantaneous							SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes																		SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:With a word and a gesture, you fill your lungs with swirling, burning energy. Then, with a mighty exhalation, you flood the space before you with a powerful cone of fire. As the last wisps of energy leave your lips, your body becomes part of the breath weapon, allowing you to flow through space and reform your body anywhere within the breath's area. You breathe forth a cone of fire that deals 8d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and spell resistance applies. When you cast this spell, you have the option of becoming part of the breath weapon and teleporting instantly to any unoccupied space within the breath weapon's area. Your entire body need not fit within the breath's area, as long as your new space shares at least 1 square with the breath weapon's area. You bring along any gear worn or carried (up to your maximum load). You can't bring along other creatures except for your familiar. You must make this decision when casting the spell, before any other effects of the breath weapon are resolved (such as saves, spell resistance, and so forth). You aren't damaged by the spell's effect when you appear within its area.
Form Of The Desert Hunter							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5													SCHOOL:Transmutation			SUBSCHOOL:Polymorph								COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 round/level (D)																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Brass scales grow from your flesh as a thick mane surrounds your face. Your arms and legs become powerfully muscled and grow sharp claws as your body hunches over to become quadrupedal, and a small pair of batlike wings sprouts from your shoulder blades. You take the form of a dragonne (MM 89). You gain 30 temporary hit points, which disappear at the end of the spell's duration. For details, see The Polymorph Subschool on page 60.
Glorious Master Of The Elements						TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7													SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Acid|Cold|Electricity|Fire	COMPS:None		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:60 ft.		TARGETAREA:One creature												DURATION:5 rounds								SAVEINFO:None						SPELLRES:Yes																		SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:A surge of arcane energy explodes from your fingertips, sending white, red, and yellow jolts lancing outward. This spell allows you to channel the awesome energy of the primal elements. For the duration of the spell, you can, as a standard action, make a ranged touch attack against any target within 60 feet. If successful, you deal 1d6 points of energy damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). Before making the attack, select the energy type from among acid, cold, electricity, and fire. Additionally, each time you successfully make an attack on a target using this spell, you gain a cumulative +2 bonus on the damage roll for each subsequent attack on the same target. This bonus is cumulative only for the duration of the spell and applies only to damage dealt by this spell. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), your ranged touch attacks from this spell instead deal 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8).
Haze Of Smoldering Stone							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6|Druid=7	CLASSES:Wu Jen=6									SCHOOL:Evocation								DESCRIPTOR:Fire					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:60 ft.		TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst											DURATION:Instantaneous							SAVEINFO:Reflex half					SPELLRES:Yes																		SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:Glowing embers swirl around your body, then fly outward to pummel nearby foes with searing volcanic rock. This spell projects hundreds of tiny, burning volcanic rocks outward from your body, dealing 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 8d6 points of fire damage. If you cast haze of smoldering stone again before the end of your next turn, the second casting deals 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 10d6 points of fire damage. Special: A character who learns this spell gains resistance to fire 3, which stacks with any other resistance to fire he already possesses.
Hoard Gullet									TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1													SCHOOL:Transmutation														COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 hour/level																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:You move your hands to your throat, chanting in low murmurs as you trace an imaginary line from your lower jaw down to your abdomen. You gain a magical second stomach, which can be used to transport objects securely. You can safely swallow and transport any object you could normally swallow (including items at least three size categories smaller than you). The capacity of your hoard gullet is 100 pounds and/or 10 cubic feet per caster level (up to a maximum of 1,000 pounds and 100 cubic feet). You can't remove individual items from your hoard gullet, but as a fullround action, you can expel its entire contents into your square. It otherwise functions as a bag of holding (DMG 248). At the end of the spell's duration, anything still in your second stomach is immediately and instantly brought up, falling to the ground next to you. You can't have more than one hoard gullet active at one time; casting this spell before its duration ends the duration of the previous casting. For example, if a 7th-level Sorcerer with 2 hours left on his hoard gullet casts the spell again, the spell's duration resets to 7 hours. Dragons often use this spell to transport their treasure hoards safely, but it is equally useful to those who would loot such hoards.
Justice Of The Wyrm King							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7													SCHOOL:Abjuration								DESCRIPTOR:Force					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:5 rounds																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:Spines of brilliant yellow light burst outward from your body, giving the impression that you are covered in glowing spikes. You create a field of arcane force around your body that deals retaliatory damage to your attackers. While this spell is active, any creature striking you with a nonreach melee weapon takes 4d6 points of damage. As part of the casting of this spell, if you are a Sorcerer you can sacrifice one additional Sorcerer spell slot of up to 9th level; this increases the damage dealt by 2 points for every level of the sacrificed slot. For example, if you use a 7th-level spell slot to cast justice of the wyrm king and sacrifice a 5th-level spell slot to augment it, you deal 4d6+10 points of damage to your attackers.
Kiss Of Draconic Defiance							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7													SCHOOL:Abjuration															COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:40 ft.		TARGETAREA:40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you							DURATION:Concentration + 1 round or until expended		SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates; see text		SPELLRES:Yes; see text																	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:A ring of radiant energy spirals out from your body, shattering the magical energies of others. This spell projects magical interference from your body, making it more difficult for others to cast spells within its area. Any enemy attempting to cast a spell within the area of a kiss of draconic defiance must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw; failure means the spell is lost (as if cast) but has no effect. Any creature that successfully saves against this spell is immune to its effect for 24 hours thereafter. Check spell resistance the first time a creature attempts to cast a spell within the area. Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can automatically counter a single spell of 5th level or lower (as per the counterspell action) as an immediate action, as long as the caster is within the area of the kiss of draconic defiance. Doing so immediately ends the duration of this spell. You do not expend any of your own spell slots to counter the other spell and need not make a Spellcraft check to identify it (though you can choose to do so to ensure that it's not higher than 5th level).
Lord Of The Sky									TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Shugenja=5[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Shugenja (air)]	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5		SCHOOL:Evocation|Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Electricity				COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 minute/level																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:A swirling cloud of black mist surrounds you, shot through with bolts of lightning and covering you in powerful magic. By casting this spell, you become more formidable in aerial combat, allowing you to deal with airborne enemies more easily. You can fly at a speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability (or 30 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or carry a medium or heavy load). If you already have a fly speed of 40 feet or greater, your fly speed improves by 10 feet, and your maneuverability improves to good (unless it's already better than that).	DESC:While airborne, you can use a swift action each round to fire a bolt of magical lightning as a ranged touch attack against any other airborne target within 60 feet. This attack deals 1 point of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20 points) and reduces the target's fly speed to 1/2 normal for the duration of the spell. This speed reduction doesn't stack, so attacking the same target multiple times yields no extra reduction in fly speed (but continues to deal damage). Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate one lightning bolt (as the spell) as a standard action. Doing so ends the duration of lord of the sky, and if you do not have a natural fly speed, you drift to the ground as per the fly spell. Special: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), this spell grants you a fly speed of 60 feet (or 40 if encumbered as described above). Dragonblooded casters who already have a fly speed of 60 feet or greater instead gain a +10-foot improvement to their fly speed.
Magic Of The Dragonheart							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer=2														SCHOOL:Transmutation														COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 hour/level																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:You speak your own name as you clench your fists at your side. An aura of bright energy forms around you, coalescing into the shape of a translucent dragon above your head. This spell grants you a variety of benefits related to your draconic feats. If you have no draconic feats, this spell has no effect. While this spell is active, you are considered to have two more draconic feats than normal for the purpose of determining the benefit of your draconic feats. For example, if you have the Draconic Heritage feat (see page 17), you would gain a +2 bonus to the specified saves for the duration of this spell, over and above the bonus already granted by that feat. In addition, for the purpose of determining the benefit of a draconic feat, treat magic of the dragonheart as if its spell level equaled 1/2 your caster level. For example, an 8th-level Sorcerer that has the Draconic Flight feat (Complete Arcane 77) would gain a fly speed of 40 feet after casting this spell, as if it were a 4th-level spell. Finally, you gain a competence bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level (maximum +10) on skill checks made with the class skill granted by your Draconic Heritage feat (if you have the feat).
Mark Of The Enlightened Soul							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=4												SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Good					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action				RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:3 rounds or until ended																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:Your hands glow softly, as if illuminated from within by a bright light. This spell adds a touch of good to your magic, granting you special potency against your evil-aligned enemies. Your spells gain the good descriptor. Any spell you cast of 3rd level or lower deals +50%% damage to evil-aligned creatures. As part of the casting of this spell, you can sacrifice one Sorcerer spell slot of 5th to 9th level; doing this increases the maximum level of spells affected by mark of the enlightened soul to the level of the sacrificed slot minus 1. For example, if you spend a 4th-level spell slot to cast the spell and a 7th-level spell slot to augment it, you would deal extra damage to evil-aligned creatures with spells of 6th level or lower. Special: A good-aligned caster of the dragonblood subtype can choose to end this spell's duration by activating protection from evil (as the spell, but targeting itself) as a swift action. This effect lasts for the normal duration of protection from evil.
Mind Of The Labyrinth								TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8													SCHOOL:Enchantment			SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 hour/level or until expended																																SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:As you close your eyes to mere slits, a black miasma of energy floats around your head, sucking in light and the stray minds of others. You twist your mind to become a magical labyrinth, bewildering unsuspecting spellcasters. If an enemy casts a mind-affecting spell or abilityt that targets you, the enemy becomes confused for 1 round, disoriented by the mazelike confines of your consciousness. (This confusion occurs whether or not the spell successfully affects you.) A successful Will save (DC 18 + your Int modifier) negates this effect and renders that foe immune to this casting of the spell. Furthermore, while mind of the labyrinth is active, you can use an immediate action to activate a dominate person effect (as the spell, except that the duration is 1 hour) on one humanoid who casts a mind-affecting spell on you. Doing so ends the duration of mind of the labyrinth, though the dominate person effect lasts for 1 hour thereafter. Special: A character who learns this spell gains a +1 competence bonus on Bluff checks.
Passage Of The Shifting Sands							TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=4												SCHOOL:Transmutation|Evocation					DESCRIPTOR:Air					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action			RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:You													DURATION:1 minute/level (D) or until expended																															SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:You entire body sparkles as color fades from your form. A stiff breeze picks up as you collapse into thousands of particles of sand, sent flying on the warm wind. You and all your belongings become a flying cloud of sand, swirling and formless yet retaining your consciousness. You lose your normal shape and become a sand cloud, taking up the same space you do in your normal form. You can fly at a speed of 40 feet (perfect maneuverability), but you lose any other movement rates you had in your normal form. Treat this otherwise as gaseous form (PH 234). If you end your movement in the same space as another creature, that creature is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude negates). Spell resistance does not apply against this effect. Furthermore, while this spell is active, you can activate a gust of wind effect (as the spell) as a swift action. Doing so ends the duration of passage of the shifting sands. Special: A blue dragon capable of casting 6th-level Sorcerer spells can cast this spell as a swift action.
Path Of Frost									TYPE:Arcane	CLASSES:Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=1												SCHOOL:Transmutation							DESCRIPTOR:Cold					COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action; see text	RANGE:30 ft.		TARGETAREA:One 5-foot square per level (maximum 5), beginning adjacent to your space (S)	DURATION:1 round/level							SAVEINFO:Reflex negates					SPELLRES:No																			SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:A pathway of solid ice races along the ground from your feet, creating a frozen strip that gives off wisps of moisture. This spell creates a pathway or area of slippery ice on the ground. Entering an affected square costs 2 squares of movement; a creature can avoid this hindrance by succeeding on a DC 10 Balance check. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more, it not only spends 2 squares of movement to enter the affected square, but it also falls prone in that square. In addition, any creature that starts its turn in an affected square or that enters an affected square takes 1 point of cold damage.

As part of the casting of this spell, if you are a Sorcerer you can sacrifice one Sorcerer spell slot of 5th to 9th level; doing this increases the maximum level of spells affected by touch of the blackened soul to the level of the sacrificed slot minus 1.

For example, a 10th-level Sorcerer who spent two 5th-level spell slots (one to cast the spell and another to enhance it) would heal 10d6 points of damage. This spell does not channel positive energy as divine healing spells do, so it functions the same for undead spellcasters as it does for living casters.
