Gaze of Terror			KEY:Ghostly Visage ~ Gaze of Terror	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.Ghostly VisageRaceTrait.SpecialAttack		DESC:Anyone within 30 feet of a ghostly visage who meets the eyes of its manifested face (see visage below) must make a Will saving throw (DC 13) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Ghostly visages are immune to their own gaze attacks and to those of others of their kind.

Meld					KEY:Ghostly Visage ~ Meld		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceTrait.Ghostly VisageRaceTrait.SpecialAttack		DESC:Once per round, a ghostly visage can merge its body with a corporeal creature. If it makes a successful incorporeal touch attack, the ghostly visage's body disappears into the opponent's body. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 13). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that ghostly visage's meld for one day.

Visage				KEY:Ghostly Visage ~ Visage		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceTrait.Ghostly VisageRaceTrait.SpecialAttack	DESC:At will, a ghostly visage can manifest a face anywhere on its host's body, including over the host's own face (the host's vision is unaffected). This face looks corporeal and fleshy, but it is actually the visage's incorporeal form. When manifesting a visage, the ghostly visage is susceptible to attacks separate from its host. Attacks that miss the visage because of its incorporeal nature (including attacks from nonmagic weapons as well as attacks that are foiled by the 50%% chance to ignore damage) target the host instead. For attacks that require attack rolls, if the attack roll exceeds the AC of the host, the host takes damage instead of the visage.

Mind Shielding			KEY:Ghostly Visage ~ Mind Shielding	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceTrait.Ghostly VisageRaceTrait.SpecialQuality	DESC:When attached to a host, a ghostly visage protects the host from mind-affecting spells and effects. This ability is similar to a mind blank spell, but does not protect the creature from divination spells that are not mind-affecting. In essence, the ghostly visage confers its undead immunity to mind-affecting spells upon the host.
