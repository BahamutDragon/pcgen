###Block: Hidden Spaces - move to EQMODs

# Modifier Name		Unique Key			Type				Cost		Source Page		Special Property
False Bottom		KEY:FALSE_BOTTOM		TYPE:Goods.Container	COST:50	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:The classic hiding spot, a false bottom can be added to any container with a hard base, from a desk drawer to a chest to a barrel. A false bottom slightly reduces the amount of storage space the object otherwise would have. Gaining access to a false bottom typically requires emptying the container of the rest of its contents and locating and triggering a small latch that loosens the false bottom and allows it to be opened. The maximum size of a false bottom is two sizes smaller than the container it is built into.
False Hold			KEY:FALSE_HOLD_VSL	TYPE:Vessel			COST:400	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:Ships of all sizes and kinds frequently contain false holds. Even vessels that conduct otherwise lawful and legitimate business might contain hidden spaces. The maximum size of a false hold in a ship is two sizes smaller than the ship itself. Most ships are Colossal, so they can have false holds of up to Huge size. A vessel without a hold (such as a rowboat) can have a hidden space added, but its maximum size is three sizes smaller than the vessel itself.
False Scabbard Tip	KEY:FALSE_TIP		TYPE:Scabbard		COST:10	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:A scabbard can be fitted with a hollow space at its end that extends a few inches beyond the tip of the blade it holds. Access to a false scabbard tip typically requires depressing a button or a latch to unhook the tip from the sheath. A quick-release mechanism, allowing access to the hidden space with only a move action, can be added to any false scabbard tip for an extra 100 gp. A scabbard is typically the same size object as the weapon it holds, and a false scabbard tip has a capacity two size categories smaller than that. A dagger's scabbard, for example, could have a false tip of Fine size, while a greatsword's scabbard could be large enough to hold a Tiny object (such as a dagger).
Hidden Flap			KEY:HIDDEN_FLAP		TYPE:Sack			COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:Packs, sacks, bags, and satchels can contain cleverly concealed inner flaps or pockets. The maximum size of the space contained beneath a hidden flap is two sizes smaller than the container it is built into.
Hollow Book			KEY:HOLLOW_BOOK		TYPE:Book			COST:5	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:Another classic hidden space design, a hollow book has the covers and spine of a normal tome and blends in with other books on a shelf. Its pages, however, are glued together and their middles cut out (usually leaving a half-inch border of paper) to form a space. Unlike with most other hidden spaces, the maximum size of the space contained inside a hollow book is one size smaller than the book it is built into, since so much of the book's volume can be used.
Hollow Boot Heel		KEY:HOLLOW_HEEL		TYPE:Boot			COST:20	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:A hollow boot heel unscrews from a boot like a jar lid to reveal the hidden space inside. The maximum size of the space contained within a hollow boot heel is four sizes smaller than the container it is built into. For example, boots made for a human (size Medium) can have hollow boot heels no larger than Fine size. An exception is that boots made for Small creatures can also have Fine-sized hollow heels.
Inside Pocket		KEY:INSIDE_POCK		TYPE:Clothing		COST:1	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:This hidden space is simply an extra pocket sewn into the inner lining of a coat, tunic, robe, or pair of trousers. An inside pocket generally only holds a few sheets of paper, parchment, or similar items, but some are made to hold a potion or a dagger. A single piece of clothing can have up to two inside pockets. A character with ranks in Sleight of Hand can substitute her Sleight of Hand check result for the normal Search DC when concealing objects in an inside pocket. She gains a +5 circumstance bonus on such checks. The maximum size of the space contained within an inside pocket is two sizes smaller than the article of clothing it is built into. For example, a robe made for a human (size Medium) can have an inside pocket no larger than Tiny.
Lead Lining			KEY:LEAD_LINING		TYPE:Goods.Container	COST:10	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	SPROP:In order to thwart the detection of a magic item it contains, a hidden space can be lined with a thin sheet of lead. Hard-sided objects can have thin lead sheets built into their walls, bottoms, and lids. Soft-sided objects, such as clothing, have threads of lead sewn into them. Either way, lead lining must be included with a hidden space when it is created, and cannot be added to an item later. Lead lining adds about 10%% to the weight of an object in which it is incorporated.
