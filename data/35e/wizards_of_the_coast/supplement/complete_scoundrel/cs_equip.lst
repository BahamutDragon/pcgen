Bow Blade				TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Bayonets	COST:4	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	SPROP:Some archers add blades to the grips or risers of their weapons. Bowyers can craft bows that allow such blades to be permanently affixed. Treat a bow blade as a punching dagger.
Crossbow Bayonet (Knife)	TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Bayonets	COST:2	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.109	SPROP:Bayonets easily fit onto light or heavy crossbows, attaching to the stock below where the bolt fires. Crossbow bayonets come in two kinds knife and sword. A knife bayonet attached to a crossbow functions as a shortspear, while a sword bayonet attached to a crossbow is treated as a spear. A crossbow with an attached bayonet cannot be thrown as a true spear can be, though it can be set against a charge. A hand crossbow is too small to accept a bayonet (but see hand crossbow blade, below).

Hand Crossbow Blade		TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Bayonets	COST:4	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	SPROP:Adding a short blade to the front of a hand crossbow allows you to defend yourself in melee combat without having to draw a different weapon. The blade functions as a dagger.

###Block: Hidden Blade
# Equipment Name	Type						Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Boot Blade		TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Hidden Blade	COST:4	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:The most common hidden blade, a boot blade is concealed in the sole of a boot, usually under the toes. The wearer activates the blade by striking a certain part of the boot (usually the toe) against the ground, which flips the weapon it into position. Treat a boot blade as a dagger.
Elbow Blade		TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Hidden Blade	COST:4	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:Hidden within bracers or the forearm piece of a suit of armor, elbow blades jut out backward and lie flat against the back of the bearer's upper arm. Activating an elbow blade usually requires a flick or twist of the wrist. Treat an elbow blade as a punching dagger.
Knee Blade		TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Hidden Blade	COST:20	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:Held within the greaves of a suit of armor, a knee blade extends with a quick upward thrust of the knee. The flat of the blade rests against the bearer's thigh, allowing for full range of movement. Treat a knee blade as a short sword.
Sleeve Blade	TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Hidden Blade	COST:4	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:Strapped to the forearm of its wearer, a sleeve blade lies hidden under a long-sleeved shirt or dress. Making a quick downward flick with the wrist triggers the mechanism, extending the blade beyond the top of the wearer's hand. Treat a sleeve blade as a dagger.
Instrument Blade	TYPE:Surprise Weapons.Hidden Blade	COST:10	WT:0.5	SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:Most stringed or wind instruments have a long, narrow section that can conceal a thin blade. Releasing a hidden catch allows the blade to spring forth. Such a blade functions as a dagger. Any stringed instrument whose neck is designed to hide a blade includes reinforcing metal bars for added support.

###Block: Alchemical
# Equipment Name		Type			Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Clearwater Tablets	TYPE:Alchemical	COST:1	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:These small black pellets smell strongly of tar. Dropping a clearwater tablet into a gallon of water cleans the water of disease, poison, and other befouling toxins. Water so treated has a vaguely tarry smell and leaves a slimy black deposit on a surface it touches but is safe to drink. Magic liquids (such as potions, oils, and magic poisons) are immune to the effect of clearwater tablets. Liquids based on oil or alcohol are also not affected.
Daystrider Capsule	TYPE:Alchemical	COST:10	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:This bright blue gelatinous ovoid, when swallowed, allows a humanoid creature to walk for 10 hours in a day (instead of the normal 8 hours) before making a Constitution check to resist damage and fatigue. Walking longer than that entails making a forced march as normal (PH 164). Consuming a second daystrider capsule before 24 hours have passed has no further effect.
Ferrous Aqua		TYPE:Alchemical	COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:A pellet of ferrous aqua is a halfinch- diameter sphere of glass containing a rusty red liquid with small black f lakes f loating in suspension. A ferrous aqua pellet can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Alternatively, it can be loaded into a sling and used as a sling bullet. When it strikes a firm surface, the pellet bursts and sprays out the suspension within. Any creature with damage reduction that is overcome by cold iron takes 1d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 round if struck by a ferrous aqua pellet (a successful DC 12 Fortitude save negates the sickened condition, but not the damage). Other creatures take no damage from a ferrous aqua pellet.
Forger's Paper		TYPE:Alchemical	COST:10	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:This normal-looking sheet of paper is infused with an alchemical substance that makes the sheet nearly transparent for 1 hour when exposed to heat. The now-clear sheet can be overlaid on a document to be copied, granting a +2 alchemical bonus on Forgery checks made while using it. Once the alchemical substance within it loses potency, the page becomes indistinguishable from a normal piece of paper (and can't be activated again by any means).
Endurance Elixir		TYPE:Alchemical	COST:25	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:Imbibing this chalky-tasting green liquid instantly acclimates a creature to its surroundings. For the next 12 hours, the drinker gains a +4 alchemical bonus on all ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws made to resist natural environmental extremes, such as hot or cold weather (DMG 302).
Liquid Sunlight		TYPE:Alchemical	COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:Shining with the light of a torch, a pellet of liquid sunlight is a half-inch-diameter sphere of glass that contains a gold-colored liquid. The pellet can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Alternatively, it can be loaded into a sling and used as a sling bullet. When it strikes a firm surface, it bursts and sprays out the liquid within. The liquid continues to glow with the light of a torch for 1 round after exposure to the air. Creatures with light sensitivity are dazzled for 1 round if struck by a liquid sunlight pellet. The pellet deals 1d6 points of damage to a vampire, vampire spawn, or any other creature similarly harmed by daylight.
Nerv				TYPE:Alchemical	COST:25	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:This is the street name for a substance also known as liquid courage, a gold-colored syrup in a clear glass bottle painted with interweaving blue and red swirls. Drinking a dose of nerv grants the drinker a +2 alchemical bonus on saves against fear effects for 1 hour.
Powdered Silver		TYPE:Alchemical	COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.110	SPROP:This fine silvery dust sparkles when held in the light and is contained in a half-inch-diameter glass sphere. A powdered silver pellet can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Alternatively, it can be loaded into a sling and used as a sling bullet. When it strikes a firm surface, the pellet bursts and sprays out the powder within. Any creature with damage reduction that is overcome by silvered weapons takes 1d6 points of damage and is sickened for 1 round if hit by a powdered silver pellet (a DC 12 Fortitude save negates the sickened condition, but not the damage). Other creatures take no damage from a powdered silver pellet.
Rust Cube			TYPE:Alchemical	COST:30	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.111	SPROP:Made of rusty iron, rust cubes are sometimes disguised as dice. A rust cube can be thrown as a ranged attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Alternatively, it can be loaded into a sling and used as a sling stone. When it strikes a hard surface, the cube shatters into a fine powder of rusted iron. An object or creature made of metal that is hit by the rust cube immediately takes 1d6 points of damage (ignoring hardness), plus an additional 1d6 points of damage each round for the next 2 rounds. A creature can wipe the dust off with a move action.
Toxic Tooth			TYPE:Alchemical	COST:25	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.111	SPROP:Since the invention of alchemical capsules (Complete Adventurer 119), researchers have continued to develop ever smaller delivery devices. The current peak of achievement comes in the form of the toxic tooth. Made to look identical to its wearer's actual teeth (including the addition of plaque, random filth, and gaping cavities if necessary), a toxic tooth can hold a single dose of a contact or inhaled poison. To activate a toxic tooth, the wearer must bite down hard enough to crack it, then spit or exhale the poison at an adjacent creature. Doing so requires a standard action to make a ranged touch attack, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the attack hits, the target is exposed to the poison and must save normally. Activating a toxic tooth also exposes its wearer to the poison.
Trail Bar			TYPE:Alchemical	COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.111	SPROP:This tough, 4-inch-long bar of vegetable matter provides the equivalent of one day's worth of food. A creature that has consumed a bar (which takes about 10 minutes) receives all the nutritional and stomach-filling value of a full day's food-if none of the flavor. However, consuming a second trail bar before 24 hours have passed sickens the creature for 1 hour. Rangers and bounty hunters carry trail bars only if going into the wilds for long periods of time, and even then only reluctantly.

###Block: Poisons
# Equipment Name	Type			Cost		Weight	Source Page		Special Property
Blasphemix		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:750	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.111	SPROP:Said to be refined from the spilled ichor of a demon, devil, or other fiend, blasphemix corrupts not only the body but also the soul. Perpetually warm, greasy, and possessed of a vile blackness that seems to writhe of its own accord, blasphemix is further profaned by prayers and chants to dark, ancient, and wholly evil powers. This liquid foulness impedes the power of faith and hinders even the most devout cleric's access to his deity. Despite its origin, this poison affects creatures of all alignments and faiths. If the subject of this poison fails the initial saving throw, its ability to cast divine spells is hindered. For the next 10 rounds, the subject must succeed on a caster level check (DC 15 + spell level) each time it attempts to cast a divine spell. Failure means the spell is lost and has no effect. Regardless of the outcome of the initial save, failing the secondary save applies a -1 penalty to the victim's caster level for all divine spells it casts for the next 12 hours. If a creature is subjected to another dose of blasphemix before the effect of the first dose has run its course, the duration of the first dose's effect ends. In addition to a Craft (poisonmaking) check, creating a dose of blasphemix requires a successful DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check.
Elemental Rime		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:200	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:This frosty blue liquid is concocted from ice found in frozen regions of the Elemental Plane of Air or Water. No amount of heat can totally dispel the coldness that emanates from elemental rime, which partially freezes those exposed to it. If the subject of the poison fails the initial saving throw, in addition to taking 1d4 points of initial and secondary Dexterity damage, it gains vulnerability to fire for 10 rounds. In addition to a Craft (poisonmaking) check, creating a dose of elemental rime requires a successful DC 15 Knowledge (the planes) check.
Goodbye Kiss		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:350	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:A sweetly flavored tincture distilled from many of the same fungi and roots used in making the drow's infamous sleeping poison, this venom is a standby of poisoners who don't want to harm their victims. Goodbye kiss is a favorite of lotharios, swindlers, and others who want to avoid being followed. It can either be added to food (ingested) or used to coat a small needle (injury); the save DC is the same regardless of the method of application. A subject who fails either the initial or the secondary save becomes exhausted for 1 hour. Failing both saves renders the subject unconscious for 1 hour instead.
Gorgon's Hair		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:300	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.112	SPROP:This versatile contact poison is named for a clever murderer who would coat her long hair in this concoction before seducing her victims. Clear and a little greasy, this toxin makes surfaces it is applied to look slightly wet, shiny, or cosmetically accented. It is unusual in that it does not affect those who already have it in their system. Thus, many who use gorgon's hair ingest a dose-a mildly unpleasant act-before coating themselves with the poison. Those who fear being attacked by gorgon's hair might also protect themselves by consuming the poison. Typically, a wouldbe poisoner mixes a dose of gorgon's hair with a liquid and drinks the concoction. After ingesting the toxin, that creature is immune to its effect for 24 hours. An immune creature can safely apply a dose of gorgon's hair to a hand or appendage to envenom an unarmed strike or natural attack. Only the first successful attack is affected; all attacks made afterward, even in the same round, do not deliver the poison.
Salvo			TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:100	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	SPROP:The fortuitous creation of a poisoner with little skill, salvo is a weapon of the imprecise and desperate. The poison is relatively cheap and easy to create, but its effect fluctuates wildly from dose to dose. Salvo deals 1d4 points of initial and secondary damage to a random ability score. Determine the affected ability by rolling 1d6 and consulting the following table; roll once per dose. The poison's type and save DC do not vary.
Siren's Breath		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:300	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	SPROP:This bitter-smelling gas causes the subject to become highly susceptible to persuasion. Failing either the initial or secondary saving throw imposes a -5 penalty on Sense Motive checks and on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects for 10 rounds. If a creature is subjected to another dose of siren's breath before the effect of the first dose has run its course, the duration of the first dose's effect ends.
Slow Death		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:250	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	SPROP:An insidiously persistent toxin distilled in part from a dwarven mining acid, slow death eats away at its victims from within. Unlike most poisons, which deal damage in two stages, slow death works constantly over the course of several rounds. A subject of this poison who fails the initial Fortitude save takes 1d6 points of damage. Each round thereafter, at the beginning of the poisoner's turn (up to a maximum of 5 rounds), the subject must repeat the saving throw. For each failure, it takes another 1d6 points of damage. Once a save succeeds, the subject takes no further damage.
Zealot's Blade		TYPE:Goods.Poison.Consumable	COST:350	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	SPROP:This venom incorporates the blood of its intended target, making it even deadlier to such creatures. A tool of hunters and assassins who stalk specific targets, each dose of zealot's blade is brewed for a specific type or subtype of creatures. When creating zealot's blade, the poisonmaker must choose a type (and subtype, if applicable) from Table 3-14: Ranger Favored Enemies on page 47 of the Player's Handbook. Any creature not of the chosen type or subtype gains a +5 bonus on saves to resist the poison's effect.
