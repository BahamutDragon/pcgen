Surprise Strike	KEY:Cloaked Dancer ~ Surprise Strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.CloakedDancer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:SurpriseStrikeDice|0	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can make a particularly effective attack against creatures distracted by your dance. As a full-round action, you can maintain your enchanting dance and make a melee attack with a light weapon, dealing an extra 1d6 points of damage. At 4th level, the extra damage you deal increases to 2d6. The extra damage from the surprise strike ability stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target. A target under the effect of your enchanting dance is considered flat-footed against the attack. Any creature that is not vulnerable to extra damage from sneak attacks is immune to this effect. This ability counts as sudden strike for the purpose of meeting prerequisites or using ambush feats (page 71).																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.32

Combat Trapping		KEY:Combat Trapsmith ~ Combat Trapping		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CombatTrapsmith Class Feature.Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:CombatTraps|0				DESC:You know how to create combat traps to aid your allies. At 1st level, you can learn two traps from the list in Table 2-6: Combat Traps, provided you meet the prerequisites. At each level thereafter, you add one additional trap to your repertoire, to a maximum of six traps known. Whenever you attain a new level in this class, you can choose to replace any one previously learned trap with a new trap. A combat trap is triggered by any Tiny or larger creature entering the trapped square. Flying or incorporeal creatures don't trigger combat traps. You can build a combat trap only on solid ground-you can't place it on a wall or ceiling, in the air, or floating in the water. A combat trap functions only once. Once set, it lasts for 1 hour or until triggered, whichever comes first. Crafting a combat trap requires a full-round action (which provokes attacks of opportunity) and a Craft (trapmaking) check. Each trap's entry lists the required Craft check DC. If the check is successful, you can place the trap in any square adjacent to your space. A failed check means that the action and materials are wasted to no effect, but you can try to set the same trap again later. Some combat traps allow a saving throw, as noted in a trap's entry. The save DC is 10 + your combat trapsmith level + your Int modifier. Locating or disabling a combat trap requires a successful Search or Disable Device check with a DC equal to 20 + your combat trapsmith level + your Int modifier. You can automatically find and disable your own combat traps. Because a combat trap is built quickly and crudely, it is also possible to discern with a successful Spot check (using the same DC as given above), whether or not the observer has the trapfinding class feature. All combat traps produce extraordinary effects, so dispel magic or spell resistance cannot interfere with them. Unless otherwise noted, an ongoing effect from a combat trap lasts for a number of rounds equal to your combat trapsmith level. Multiple effects from the same kind of combat trap don't stack; use only the longer duration. Creating combat traps requires a special kit containing raw materials and tools. A combat trapsmith's kit costs 100 gp, weighs 10 pounds, and provides components sufficient to create ten traps. A combat trap can't be cannibalized for raw materials, nor can its materials be retrieved if the trap isn't triggered.	SOURCEPAGE:p.34
Trap Sense			KEY:Combat Trapsmith ~ Trap Sense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:CombatTrapsmith Class Feature.Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:TrapSense|0				DESC:Beginning at 1st level, you become more adept at evading the effects of traps.

Doing so increases the Craft (trapmaking) check DC by 5 but otherwise has no effect on the trap's potency.

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

Spellcasting			KEY:Gray Guard ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At each even-numbered level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a gray guard, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Sacrament of Trust		KEY:Gray Guard ~ Sacrament of Trust			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause's behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct. Dishonorable acts still cause you to lose both gray guard and paladin class features until you atone, but this infraction is considered much less severe than it would be for a paladin. Thus, whenever you seek to atone for deeds that you willingly commit in the name of your faith but that break your code of conduct, a cleric casting an atonement spell on your behalf does not expend 500 XP as is normally required. This reprieve applies only to acts intended to further the cause of righteousness and the gray guard's faith. No XP cost applies to a gray guard atoning after beating a confession from a heretic, for example, but the cost would have to be paid for one who started a barroom brawl.	SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Lay on Hands			KEY:Gray Guard ~ Lay on Hands				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:This ability is identical to the paladin class feature of the same name (PH 44). Levels of gray guard stack with other class levels that grant lay on hands to determine the ability's total healing capacity.																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Debilitating Touch		KEY:Gray Guard ~ Debilitating Touch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 2nd level, you learn to channel your lay on hands ability into a painful touch attack. Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target's ability to successfully bluff or resist magical effects. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An opponent hit by this attack is sickened for 5 rounds. Using this ability costs 5 points of your daily healing allotment. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the effect.																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Smite Evil				KEY:Gray Guard ~ Smite Evil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:SmiteEvilTimes|0			DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you can smite evil once per day. See the paladin class feature (PH 44). At 8th level, you can smite evil one additional time per day. Levels of other classes that grant the smite evil class feature stack for the purpose of determining the extra damage dealt. For example, a 5th-level paladin/5th-level gray guard delivering a smite evil attack adds 10 points of damage to the attack.																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Justice Blade			KEY:Gray Guard ~ Justice Blade			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:GrayGuardJusticeBladeTier|0	DESC:By 4th level, you have learned that suffering and injustice are not the exclusive province of evil. You can use your smite evil ability to instead punish creatures of chaotic alignment. Using this ability expends one daily use of your smite evil class feature and works identically in all other ways, but its effect applies only to chaotic targets. Whenever you choose to smite an opponent, you must declare whether you are using this ability to smite evil or chaos. If you accidentally smite a creature of an alignment other than that declared, the smite has no effect but the ability is still used up. Beginning at 9th level, you can use justice blade to smite creatures of any alignment. You need not declare an alignment before making the smite attack, although if the attack misses, that use of smite is still used up for the day.																							SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Devastating Touch			KEY:Gray Guard ~ Devastating Touch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:When you attain 5th level, your deity shows its approval of your grim work. From this point on, you can use your lay on hands ability to make a touch attack that harms your enemies. Using devastating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You decide how many points of your daily healing allotment to expend after successfully touching a creature: Each point expended deals 1 point of damage to the target. A nonevil creature is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) to halve the amount of damage dealt.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Unbound Justice			KEY:Gray Guard ~ Unbound Justice			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they're unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Intimidate skill checks.																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Sacrament of the True Faith	KEY:Gray Guard ~ Sacrament of the True Faith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 10th level, you gain your order's full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order's ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful (see Ex-Gray Guards, below).																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.42
Code of Conduct			KEY:Gray Guard ~ Code of Conduct			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:GrayGuard Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:As a gray guard, you are held to the same code of conduct as a paladin. You must be of lawful good alignment and must never willingly commit an evil act. You must also pledge to respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, cheating, using poison, and the like), aid the needy, and punish those who harm the innocent. If you contravene your code of conduct, you must atone for the transgression or lose all class abilities from both gray guard and paladin levels. As you advance in the prestige class, this code becomes more flexible. However, its tenets still apply: You can never break your code without good reason. Gray guards can freely multiclass between paladin and gray guard.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.42

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

Deceptive Summons			KEY:Malconvoker ~ Deceptive Summons			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Malconvoker Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:MalconvokerDeceptiveSummonsLVL|0	DESC:At 1st level, you can attempt to trick evil creatures you conjure into serving you for longer than they normally would. When casting a summon monster spell to summon an evil-aligned creature, you can attempt a Bluff check as a free action, opposed by the creature's Sense Motive check. If your check succeeds, the duration of the effect is doubled (as if by the Extend Spell feat), and the summoned creature might be subject to additional effects as described below. If it fails, the duration remains as normal and no additional effects can be applied. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the creature breaks free of your control and is hostile toward you (though it still disappears as normal when the spell's duration ends). If you use this ability when summoning multiple creatures, you must attempt an opposed skill check separately against each creature you wish to affect. Beginning at 4th level, you can whip the deceived creatures into an infernal fury. If your Bluff check to extend the duration of summoning succeeds, the creatures get a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls and 2 extra hit points per Hit Die (in addition to the bonuses conferred by Augment Summoning). Beginning at 7th level, you can instill the deceived creatures with exceptional resistance to your enemies' attempts to control or dismiss them. If your Bluff check to extend the duration of summoning succeeds, the creatures get a +2 bonus on Will saves, and your effective caster level is increased by 2 for the purpose of resisting dispel magic and similar effects against those creatures.	SOURCEPAGE:p.48
Unrestricted Conjuration	KEY:Malconvoker ~ Unrestricted Conjuration	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Malconvoker Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality											DESC:For the purpose only of casting conjuration spells, you can ignore any restrictions that forbid you from casting spells of certain alignments. In addition, regular use of conjuration spells with the evil descriptor does not threaten to change your alignment. For example, a good cleric who becomes a malconvoker could cast summon monster I to summon a fiendish raven (whose alignment gives the spell the evil descriptor). The cleric could not cast death knell, though, which has the evil descriptor but is not of the conjuration school.

Upon calling an evil outsider using a planar binding spell, you can make a Bluff check opposed by the creature's Sense Motive skill check. If you succeed on this check, the called creature becomes more amenable to your cause, taking a -5 penalty on the opposed Charisma check made to refuse serving you. If you fail, the creature immediately makes a new Will saving throw against your spell. On a failure, the spell functions as normal. If it succeeds on this save, the creature breaks free of your control and can either flee or attack you.

Creating a new persona mask requires 8 hours of work and costs 100 gp. You can use only persona masks that you have crafted. No one else (not even another master of masks) can benefit from a persona mask that you create. To gain the benefit of a mask, you merely wear it. Putting on a mask is a standard action, and removing one is a move action. Once it is worn, the mask's benefit immediately applies. Your master of masks level is your caster level for any spell-like abilities produced by a mask. In addition to its other benefits, a mask conceals your alignment, replacing it (for the purpose of detection spells or abilities) with an alignment appropriate to the mask. You still retain your normal alignment for all other purposes (such as if a paladin uses smite evil against you).

As an immediate action, you can use feather fall as a spell-like ability any number of times per day, but only on yourself. Once per day as a swift action, you can use fly as a spelllike ability; the effect lasts for 5 rounds. As you advance in the master of masks class, you can use this ability more often: twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 7th level, and four times per day at 10th level.

As you advance in the master of masks class, you can use additional spell-like abilities, each once per day: 4th level, invisibility and scorching ray; 7th level, lightning bolt and slow; and 10th level, dimension door and ice storm. Your caster level is treated as two higher for the purpose of casting arcane spells (up to a maximum of your character level).

You can deliver a sneak attack that deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when you are flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus (see the rogue class feature, PH 50). As you advance in the master of masks class, your sneak attack becomes more devastating: This extra damage improves to 2d6 points at 4th level, 3d6 at 7th level, and 4d6 at 10th level. If you get a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack. In addition, you gain a +2 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.

Psibond			KEY:Psibond Agent ~ Psibond			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsibondAgent Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a member of this class, you know how to create a mental link between yourself and a subject. You must be psionically focused to forge the psibond, but afterward you can expend your focus as needed to use other abilities. Establishing a psibond requires a standard action, and an unwilling subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + your psibond agent level + your Cha modifier) to resist. Once established, a psibond lasts as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 1 minute per class level. The maximum range at which a psibond can be established is 100 feet, but once in place it persists even if the subject moves out of this range (the psibond is suppressed, but not broken, while the subject is on a different plane). A psibond grants you various options for gathering information or controlling the subject, based on your class level.									SOURCEPAGE:p.60

You make any skill checks involving senses, such as Spot or Listen, as if you were the subject (using that individual's skill modifiers), and as if you were in the subject's location. You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while directly sensing what the subject senses. This ability otherwise works like the forced sense link power (Expanded Psionics Handbook 131).																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Nudge				KEY:Psibond Agent ~ Nudge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsibondAgent Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can subtly influence the subject of your psibond. As an immediate action, you can implant a subtle suggestion about which course of action the subject takes if presented with a choice. You cannot communicate any specific action to your subject; you can only nudge it toward a specific choice. For example, if your subject is offered a choice of shifts for the night watch, you can suggest which one to take. No saving throw applies against this effect, but if the suggested action presents any obvious danger to the subject, your nudge fails; the psibond isn't broken. You can't implant the same nonverbal suggestion more than once during the same psibond.																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Empathy			KEY:Psibond Agent ~ Empathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsibondAgent Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 4th level, you can detect the surface emotions of the subject of your psibond as a free action.

False Sensory Input	KEY:Psibond Agent ~ False Sensory Input	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsibondAgent Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 8th level, you gain a limited ability to falsify one of the senses of your psibond's subject. This requires a swift action to activate or maintain each round, and otherwise works like the false sensory input power (Expanded Psionics Handbook 106), though no save is allowed.																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.61
Dominate			KEY:Psibond Agent ~ Dominate			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsibondAgent Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 10th level, you gain the ability to fully control the subject of your psibond. This works like the dominate monster spell (PH 224) and requires a standard action to activate. The subject is allowed a Will save (DC 19 + your Cha modifier) to resist the effect. If you successfully dominate the subject, the effect lasts for 1 hour. Using this ability automatically ends your psibond with the subject, regardless of whether it succeeds on the save.

Sneak Attack		KEY:Psibond Agent ~ Sneak Attack		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsibondAgent Class Feature.Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus.

SOURCEPAGE:p.62
Double Psibond		KEY:Psibond Agent ~ Double Psibond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:PsibondAgent Class Feature.Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 7th level, you learn the secret of maintaining two psibonds simultaneously. Each psibond must be established separately against a different subject, but your concentration maintains both links equally well. Using any special abilities through the links must be done separately (for example, establishing a forced sense link requires a separate swift action for each subject).

Spellwarp		KEY:Spellwarp Sniper ~ Spellwarp		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellwarpSniper Class Feature.Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:You can alter the form of certain area spells into rays as you cast them. As a free action, you can warp a 1st-level area spell with instantaneous duration and a range greater than touch. The spell's level, components, range, and damage (if any) remain unchanged. However, the spell's area entry is replaced by an effect entry of "ray." The spell acts in all ways as a ray, and is considered a ray for the purpose of effects that modify or depend on rays (such as the other abilities of this prestige class). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to affect an opponent with the spell. Even if the original spell allowed a Reflex save to reduce or negate its effect, the ray does not. However, if the original spell allowed a Fortitude or Will save to reduce or negate the spell's effect, the save still applies. You must decide to warp the spell as you cast it. You do not need to prepare it as a warped spell. You can apply metamagic feats as normal to the spell, as long as they can affect ray spells. Each time you advance a level in this class, the maximum level of spell that you can affect increases by one. For example, a 3rd-level spellwarp sniper can warp spells of up to 3rd level.	SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Sudden Raystrike	KEY:Spellwarp Sniper ~ Sudden Raystrike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellwarpSniper Class Feature.Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:SuddenRayStrikeDice|0	DESC:If you can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from your ray attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever the target of one of your ray spells is denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus of not), you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with your ray spell. (If your ray spell doesn't deal hit point damage, this extra damage doesn't apply.) At 4th level, the extra damage increases to 2d6. If you get a sneak attack or sudden strike bonus from another source (such as rogue or ninja levels), the bonuses on damage stack whenever both abilities would apply to the same target. This damage applies only to targets within 30 feet. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to your sudden raystrikes.																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.64
Precise Shot	KEY:Spellwarp Sniper ~ Precise Shot		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellwarpSniper Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 3rd level, you gain Precise Shot as a bonus feat.

Ray Mastery		KEY:Spellwarp Sniper ~ Ray Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellwarpSniper Class Feature.Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 5th level, you attain unequaled control over your ray spells. This control manifests in three ways. . You can apply the extra damage from the sudden raystrike ability (as well as any additional sneak attack or sudden strike damage from other sources) to ray attacks against a target within 60 feet, instead of 30 feet. . You can deliver a coup de grace with a ray spell that deals hit point damage. You must be adjacent to your target to deliver the coup de grace. . Once per day, you can empower a single ray spell, as though with the Empower Spell feat, without any adjustment to the spell's level or casting time. This effect applies equally to spells that are already rays and those you warp into rays.																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.65
