City Magic						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES												PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=3																																		DESC:You can use the city itself to enhance your spellcasting.																																												ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																								SOURCEPAGE:59	BENEFIT:You can modify any damaging spell you cast to incorporate the urban environment. When casting an offensive spell with an energy subtype-acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic-you can invest the spell with a portion of the city's spirit. In most cases, this investment is gritty and spectacular, drawing dirt, gravel, nails, and other nearby detritus into the spell effect. In other cases, the investiture is much more subtle, often merely changing the look of the spell. Only half the damage from a spell with the appropriate subtype is considered energy damage, and is thus subject to resistance or immunities. This investiture only occurs for spells cast within urban environments, defined as any area above the size of a small town. For exampple, a wzard uses City Magic to cast a fireball at a creature with resistance to fire 15. The damage roll is 20, half of it is fire, and half "city". Thus, the target takes 10 points of "city" damage instead of 5 points of fire damage. Thus feat is useless to spellcasters who cast their spells in a nonurban environment as defined above. This uses a spell lost of the spell's normal level.
Deceptive Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES																																																		DESC:You can cast spells that seem to come from somewhere other than where they should.																																								ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																								SOURCEPAGE:60	BENEFIT:A deceptive spell appears to come from any direction you choose. For instance, a magic missile might shoot from a nearby doorway, rather than from your own finger, or a lightning bolt might emerge from the floor rather than from you. You cannot use this feat to gain a bonus to hit, to circumvent cover, to flank, or in any other way to gain a numeric or mechanical advantage on any attack rolls. Its purpose is to disguise the source of the spell, preventing anyone who did not actively observe you casting it from recognizing you as its caster. You cannot apply Deceptive Spell to any spell with a range of touch or a target of you. A deceptive spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Efficient Defender				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Fighter				VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Armor Proficiency (Heavy)																												DESC:You have learned to use new techniques and modification to your armor to increase its protective ability.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:60	BENEFIT:When you wear light or medium armor, you gain 1 more point of armor bonus to your AC than that armor normally provides. For example, a suit of studded leather would have a +4 armor bonus rather than 3. However, because you must adjust and customize the armor to more effectively cover weak spots, it is also slightly more encumbering, increasing its armor check penalty by 1. You are not required to make use of this feat. You decide when donning the armor whether you wish to don it normally, or with this feat in effect.
Extra Contacts					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																														PRESTAT:1,CHA=11												DEFINE:MaxNumberOfContacts|0	BONUS:VAR|MaxNumberOfContacts|CHA	DESC:You make connections and alliances easiliy.																					STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																												BONUS:VAR|MaxNumberOfContacts|4												SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:Your maximum number of contacts increases by four.
Favored						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																																	PRETEXT:Membership in a guild, church, or other organization.							DESC:You are an active and valued member of your guild, church, or other organization.																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:Select one of your organization's associated skills. As long as you remain a member of that organization, you gain a +2 competence bonus on checks made with that skill. Additionally, you gain one special benefit depending on your specific guild, church, or organization. These are described as "favored benefits" in the guild, organization, and church entries, beginning on page 84. You can take this feat multiple times but it must be for a different group of which you are a member each time.
Invisible Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																													DESC:You can make your spell effects invisible.																																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																								SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:You can modify any spell you cast so that it carries no visual manifestation. All other aspects of the spell, including range, area, targets, and damage remain the same. Note that this feat has no bearing on any components required to cast the enhanced spell, so the spell's source might still be apparent, depending on the situation, despite its effects being unseen. For example, a fireball cast by someone with this feat could be made invisible in the moment of its detonation, but everyone in the area would still feel the full effect (including the heat), and any flammable materials ignited by the explosion would still burn visibly with nonmagical fire. Those with detect magic, see invisibility, or true seeing spells or effects active at the time of the casting will see whatever visual manifestations typically accompany the spell.
Primary Contact					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Favored																															DESC:Your rapport with one of your contacts is stronger than your relationship with the rest.																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:When you gain this feat, select one of your existing contacts to be named your primary contact. Choose one skill associated with the organization to which your contact belongs. You gain 1 bonus rank in that skill (even if doing so would put you above your normal maximum ranks for that skill). In addition, you can double the frequency with which you can call upon your primary contact for no-charge favors. For example, if your primary contact normally provides its no-charge favor once per month, you can now call upon that favor twice per month.
Roof-Jumper						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility,Roofwalker			PRESKILL:2,Balance=7,Jump=7																					DESC:You can make use of the features of the city as handholds and footholds, defying the pull of gravity.																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:62	BENEFIT:You gain 3 tactical maneuvers. You cannot benefit from more than one maneuver in the same round. Death from Above: You do substantial damage if you deliberately leap down to attack a foe beneath you. You must drop at least 20 feet. You must roll to hit; this qualifies as a charge attack, with all relevant bonuses and penalties. If you hit, you deal damage as normal, plus an extra 1d6 points for every 10 feet of distance beyond the first 10 feet; thus, a drop of 30 feet causes an extra 2d6 points of damage.  You still take whatever damage you would normally take from the fall, but you can reduce the falling damage with a successful Jump check or Tumble check. You cannot use any ability to slow your fall (such as the monk's slow fall ability, or the feather fall spell) while attacking in this manner. Urban Acrobatics: You can make use of windowsills, awnings, lamp posts, and similar features of the city when leaping or falling from buildings. If you deliberately jump downward within arm's reach of a wall or similar vertical surface, you can move yourself sideways along the wall, traveling up to 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall. If you accidentally fall, you can move 5 feet horizontally for every 20 feet you fall. You can move up to your full movement horizontally in this fashion (so long as the wall is wide enough), even if that distance, plus your falling distance, exceeds your normal movement rate.
Roofwalker						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility				PRESKILL:2,Balance=5,Jump=5																					DESC:You are adept at moving and fighting on rooftops and ledges.																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:63	BENEFIT:You gain 3 maneuvers. Fleet of Feet - you can walk across a precarious surface at full speed without taking a -5 penalty on your Balance check. Graceful Drop - If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you fell. If you succeed on your jump check, it subracts 20 feet from the distance instead of 10. Master of the Roof - You know how to use the slopes to your advantage. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against any opponent on a different elevation than you.
Scult Spell						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																													DESC:You can alter the are of your spells.																																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																								SOURCEPAGE:63	BENEFIT:You can modify an area spell by changing the area's shape to either a cylinder (10-foot radius, 30 feet high), a 40-foot cone, four 10-foot cubes, a ball (20-footradius spread), or a 120-foot line. A sculpted spell works normally in all respects except for its shape. For example, a lightning bolt whose area is changed to a ball deals the same amount of damage, but affects a 20-foot-radius spread.
Special Dispensation				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Favored																															DESC:You have been given leave to carry even banned armor, weapons, and equipment in a given area.																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:63	BENEFIT:Due in part to your standing within your organization, you have received special dispensation from the authorities to wear or carry whatever equipment you deem necessary, regardless of local armor and weapons laws. This feat is often represented in the game, either by an object of some kind—typically an official government seal—or even a mark, such as a tattoo.
Strong Stomach					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance										PRESTAT:1,CON=13																		DESC:You have greater resilience to illness and foul odors than most people.																																																																			BONUS:VAR|RageSicknessPenalty|1												SOURCEPAGE:64	BENEFIT:You reduce the effects of sickening and nausea by one step. You cannot become nauseated. If you are exposed to an effect or condition that would normally make you nauseated, you become sickened instead. If an effect or condition would normally sicken you, that effect is negated.
Swift Tumbler					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																									PRESKILL:1,Tumble=7																						DESC:You can flip, twist, and roll with great speed. You might have learned this by traversing the city's rooftops or simply by moving through the throng day after day.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:64	BENEFIT:When tumbling, you move at a a speed equal to half your base speed + 10 feet.
Urban Tracking					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																																																		DESC:You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities.																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:64	BENEFIT:To find an individual's trail, or to follow a trail for 1 hour, requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour you search, as well as each time the trail becomes more difficult to follow, such as when it takes you to a different part of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down you quarry, depends on the community size and the prevailing conditions. If you fail a check, you can retru after 1 hour of questioning, the DM should  the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn't know exactly how much time the task will require. You can cut the time between Gather Information checks in half (from 1 hour to 30 minutes), but you take a -5 penalty on the check. Obviously, this feat will not allow you to locate someone who has gone beyond the boundaries of the community, but it could inform you that they've done so.
