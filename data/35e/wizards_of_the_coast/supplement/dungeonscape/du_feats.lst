###Block:
Combat Tinkering		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:You can disarm traps or pick locks quickly and efficiently, even under the pressure of combat.	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 bonus on Concentration checks to avoid being distracted in combat while making Disable Device or Open Lock checks. You also gain a +4 bonus when attempting to quicken a Disable Device or Open Lock check (see the Quickened Skill Checks sidebar). Normal: You must make a Concentration check whenever you are damaged or otherwise distracted while attempting to use the Disable Device or Open Lock skills. The DC to open a lock or disable a device is increased by 20 if you attempt to complete the task in a shorter amount of time. Special: This feat is particularly useful against encounter traps (see page 120).
Gnome Tunnel Acrobatics	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:Goblin raiding parties whisper of the crazed but effective tactics that gnome tunnel guards use to defend their homes. The gnomes excel at using acrobatics to penetrate enemy ranks or launch devastating attacks from above.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Gnome; or base attack bonus +4, Knowledge (dungeoneering) 2 ranks, and Tumble 9 ranks.	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Gnome],[PREMULT:2,[PRETOTALAB:4],[PRESKILL:2,Knowledge (Dungeoneering)=2,Tumble=9]]	BENEFIT:The Gnome Tunnel Acrobatics feat enables the use of certain tactical maneuvers, described below.	BENEFIT:&nl;Combat Puppeteer: You slip between your foes in a blur of movement, confusing them and causing them to strike at each other by mistake. If you use the Tumble skill to avoid an opponent's attack of opportunity, you can use this maneuver on the following round. You must make a double move and attempt a Tumble check at a -5 penalty to avoid a foe's attack of opportunity. If your check succeeds, your foe makes an attack of opportunity but targets a creature of your choice within its reach rather than you. You can use this maneuver against one creature per round.	BENEFIT:&nl;Tunnel Scrambler: Using a series of deft tumbles and somersaults, you crowd your opponent and force him to move. If you make a successful melee attack against an opponent who has walls adjacent to at least two sides of his space, you can make a special Tumble check on your next turn. This check requires a full-round action. As part of this action, make a Tumble check to move through the target's space. On a successful check, you stop in his space (rather than move past him) and attack as part of your full-round action. If the check fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity, and the rest of your full-round action is wasted. If your melee attack hits, you move your foe 5 feet in a direction of your choice. You now occupy the space that he occupied (or one of the spaces of your choice). If your melee attack misses, you return to the space you occupied when you started this maneuver.	BENEFIT:&nl;Wall Leaper: If you drop from a wall while climbing and land adjacent to a creature, you can make one attack as a standard action. This attack counts as a charge, and you gain a bonus on your damage roll equal to the number of points of falling damage that you take.	BENEFIT:Special: A fighter can select Gnome Tunnel Acrobatics as one of his fighter bonus feats (PH 38).
Hammer And Piton		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Fighter.Style	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:You can drive pitons into your foes, giving you a useful perch from which to strike.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Strength 15, Climb 3 ranks.	PRESTAT:1,STR=15	PRESKILL:1,Climb=3	BENEFIT:While wielding a one-handed bludgeoning melee weapon in your primary hand and a climbing piton or spike in the other, you can make a touch attack with the piton as a standard action. This attack deals 1d4 points of damage + your Strength modifier. The target must be size Large or bigger. If the target is at least one size category larger than you, you can make a special Climb check (DC equal to the target's Armor Class) to enter his space as a move action. You must make the check on the same turn in which you struck your foe with the piton. If the check succeeds, you enter and remain in the target's space without provoking an attack of opportunity from the target. You lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, but if your foe moves, you remain in his space as he moves. If any attack against you deals 10 or more points of damage, you must make a Climb check (DC equal to the number of points of damage) to remain in place. If the check fails, you must leave your foe's space and enter the nearest clear space. Special: A fighter can select Hammer and Piton as one of his fighter bonus feats (PH 38).
Quick Reconnoiter		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:You are skilled at scanning an area or object quickly and thoroughly.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Listen 5 ranks, Spot 5 ranks.	PRESKILL:2,Listen=5,Spot=5	BENEFIT:You can make one Spot check and one Listen check each round as a free action. You also gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Normal: Using Spot or Listen in a reactive fashion is a free action, but actively trying to make a Spot check or a Listen check requires a move action.	BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|2
Trap Engineer		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:You have spent a great deal of time studying trap construction and recognize the work of famous builders, which gives you an edge against their devices.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Knowledge (architecture and engineering) 1 rank, Knowledge (dungeoneering) 4 ranks.	BENEFIT:You know the styles of famous dungeon architects or recognize their influences. After finding or setting off a trap in a dungeon, you gain a +2 bonus on future Search checks and Disable Device checks to find or disarm traps in that same dungeon. You also gain a +4 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps in that dungeon, and a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks made by traps in that dungeon.
Trap Sensitivity		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Your senses are so attuned that you can detect mechanical traps that are close by.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Elf or trapfinding class feature, trap sense +2.	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Elf],[PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Trapfinding],[PREVARGTEQ:TrapSenseBonus,2]]		BENEFIT:When you pass within 5 feet of a mechanical trap, you are entitled to make a Search check to notice the trap as if you were looking for it. You cannot sense magic traps or spell traps with this feat. Normal: Without this feat, you must actively search for a trap to find it before it activates.
Tunnel Fighting		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:You are adept at maneuvering and fighting in tight spaces and underground passages.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.	PRETOTALAB:1	BENEFIT:When squeezing into or through a tight space, you do not take a penalty on your attack rolls or to your Armor Class. Normal: Each movement into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space, you take a -4 penalty on your attack rolls and a -4 penalty to your Armor Class (PH 148). Special: A fighter can select Tunnel Fighting as one of his fighter bonus feats (PH 38).
Undermountain Tactics	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical		SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Dwarves have developed a variety of cunning tactics to defeat those foolish enough to enter their mountain redoubts. While gnomes lack the dwarves' militaristic streak, they too have refined these tactics in countless battles against kobolds and goblins.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dwarf or gnome; or base attack bonus +6 and Knowledge (dungeoneering) 2 ranks.	PREMULT:1,[PRERACE:1,Dwarf,Gnome],[PREMULT:2,[PRETOTALAB:6],[PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (dungeoneering)=2]]		BENEFIT:The Undermountain Tactics feat enables the use of certain tactical maneuvers, described below.	BENEFIT:&nl;Stair King: To use this maneuver, you must gain the high ground bonus on your attacks against an opponent. If you hit your foe with two or more melee attacks during your turn, he must make a Balance check (DC 10 + your Str modifier) or be knocked prone. Your opponent can opt to succeed automatically on his Balance check. If he does so, he will lose his move action on his next turn, but he will succeed automatically on Balance checks to resist this maneuver until the start of his next turn. Your opponent must make this choice before seeing the result of his Balance check. You can target a particular creature with this maneuver once per round.	BENEFIT:&nl;Tunnel Fighter: To use this maneuver, you must be the target of at least one melee attack from at least one foe while standing with walls adjacent to you on two or more sides. When you are attacked under such conditions, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class due to cover. (If you gain cover from another source, this benefit does not stack with it.) You also block line of sight for any spells or attacks made by your opponents, though your allies can fire through your space as normal.	BENEFIT:&nl;Door Sentinel: To use this maneuver, you must fight defensively while adjacent to or standing in a doorway, a gate, or a similar opening in a wall. You must be adjacent to or standing in each square across the doorway's width. For 1 round after you fight defensively, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength or Dexterity checks to resist bull rush or trip attacks. Any creature attempting a Tumble check to avoid your attack of opportunity takes a -5 penalty on the check. Any creature attempting to tumble through your space takes a -10 penalty on its check.	BENEFIT:&nl;Special: A fighter can select Undermountain Tactics as one of his fighter bonus feats (PH 38).
Weapon And Torch		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Style			SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:You have mastered a style of fighting that uses a melee weapon and a torch to devastating effect. You can dazzle and burn your opponent with the open flame.	BENEFIT:While fighting with a one-handed melee weapon and holding a lit torch in the other hand, you can make a special attack as a full-round action. Attack once with your melee weapon. If the attack hits, you also sweep your torch across your foe's eyes, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage and dazzling him for 1d4 rounds. You can also use this feat while wielding a lit lantern, a sunrod, or an everburning torch in your off hand, although items that do not give off heat do not deal fire damage.


###Block: Questionable Entries -- Cityscape?
# Feat Name						Type							Visible	Required Ability									Required Class			Required Feat						Required Skill			Required Stat	Required Text									Define					Description																												Stackable?	Multiple?	Choose		Add 																		Add Spell Lvl	Caster level										Bonus DC									Modify VAR																Source Page		Benefits
City Magic						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES												PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=3																																		DESC:You can use the city itself to enhance your spellcasting.																																												ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																								SOURCEPAGE:59	BENEFIT:You can modify any damaging spell you cast to incorporate the urban environment. When casting an offensive spell with an energy subtype-acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic-you can invest the spell with a portion of the city's spirit. In most cases, this investment is gritty and spectacular, drawing dirt, gravel, nails, and other nearby detritus into the spell effect. In other cases, the investiture is much more subtle, often merely changing the look of the spell. Only half the damage from a spell with the appropriate subtype is considered energy damage, and is thus subject to resistance or immunities. This investiture only occurs for spells cast within urban environments, defined as any area above the size of a small town. For exampple, a wzard uses City Magic to cast a fireball at a creature with resistance to fire 15. The damage roll is 20, half of it is fire, and half "city". Thus, the target takes 10 points of "city" damage instead of 5 points of fire damage. Thus feat is useless to spellcasters who cast their spells in a nonurban environment as defined above. This uses a spell lost of the spell's normal level.
Deceptive Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES																																																		DESC:You can cast spells that seem to come from somewhere other than where they should.																																								ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																								SOURCEPAGE:60	BENEFIT:A deceptive spell appears to come from any direction you choose. For instance, a magic missile might shoot from a nearby doorway, rather than from your own finger, or a lightning bolt might emerge from the floor rather than from you. You cannot use this feat to gain a bonus to hit, to circumvent cover, to flank, or in any other way to gain a numeric or mechanical advantage on any attack rolls. Its purpose is to disguise the source of the spell, preventing anyone who did not actively observe you casting it from recognizing you as its caster. You cannot apply Deceptive Spell to any spell with a range of touch or a target of you. A deceptive spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
Efficient Defender				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Fighter				VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Armor Proficiency (Heavy)																												DESC:You have learned to use new techniques and modification to your armor to increase its protective ability.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:60	BENEFIT:When you wear light or medium armor, you gain 1 more point of armor bonus to your AC than that armor normally provides. For example, a suit of studded leather would have a +4 armor bonus rather than 3. However, because you must adjust and customize the armor to more effectively cover weak spots, it is also slightly more encumbering, increasing its armor check penalty by 1. You are not required to make use of this feat. You decide when donning the armor whether you wish to don it normally, or with this feat in effect.
Extra Contacts					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																														PRESTAT:1,CHA=11												DEFINE:MaxNumberOfContacts|0	BONUS:VAR|MaxNumberOfContacts|CHA	DESC:You make connections and alliances easiliy.																					STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																												BONUS:VAR|MaxNumberOfContacts|4												SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:Your maximum number of contacts increases by four.
Favored						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																																	PRETEXT:Membership in a guild, church, or other organization.							DESC:You are an active and valued member of your guild, church, or other organization.																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:Select one of your organization's associated skills. As long as you remain a member of that organization, you gain a +2 competence bonus on checks made with that skill. Additionally, you gain one special benefit depending on your specific guild, church, or organization. These are described as "favored benefits" in the guild, organization, and church entries, beginning on page 84. You can take this feat multiple times but it must be for a different group of which you are a member each time.
Invisible Spell					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																													DESC:You can make your spell effects invisible.																																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																																								SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:You can modify any spell you cast so that it carries no visual manifestation. All other aspects of the spell, including range, area, targets, and damage remain the same. Note that this feat has no bearing on any components required to cast the enhanced spell, so the spell's source might still be apparent, depending on the situation, despite its effects being unseen. For example, a fireball cast by someone with this feat could be made invisible in the moment of its detonation, but everyone in the area would still feel the full effect (including the heat), and any flammable materials ignited by the explosion would still burn visibly with nonmagical fire. Those with detect magic, see invisibility, or true seeing spells or effects active at the time of the casting will see whatever visual manifestations typically accompany the spell.
Primary Contact					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Favored																															DESC:Your rapport with one of your contacts is stronger than your relationship with the rest.																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:61	BENEFIT:When you gain this feat, select one of your existing contacts to be named your primary contact. Choose one skill associated with the organization to which your contact belongs. You gain 1 bonus rank in that skill (even if doing so would put you above your normal maximum ranks for that skill). In addition, you can double the frequency with which you can call upon your primary contact for no-charge favors. For example, if your primary contact normally provides its no-charge favor once per month, you can now call upon that favor twice per month.
Roof-Jumper						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility,Roofwalker			PRESKILL:2,Balance=7,Jump=7																					DESC:You can make use of the features of the city as handholds and footholds, defying the pull of gravity.																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:62	BENEFIT:You gain 3 tactical maneuvers. You cannot benefit from more than one maneuver in the same round. Death from Above: You do substantial damage if you deliberately leap down to attack a foe beneath you. You must drop at least 20 feet. You must roll to hit; this qualifies as a charge attack, with all relevant bonuses and penalties. If you hit, you deal damage as normal, plus an extra 1d6 points for every 10 feet of distance beyond the first 10 feet; thus, a drop of 30 feet causes an extra 2d6 points of damage.  You still take whatever damage you would normally take from the fall, but you can reduce the falling damage with a successful Jump check or Tumble check. You cannot use any ability to slow your fall (such as the monk's slow fall ability, or the feather fall spell) while attacking in this manner. Urban Acrobatics: You can make use of windowsills, awnings, lamp posts, and similar features of the city when leaping or falling from buildings. If you deliberately jump downward within arm's reach of a wall or similar vertical surface, you can move yourself sideways along the wall, traveling up to 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall. If you accidentally fall, you can move 5 feet horizontally for every 20 feet you fall. You can move up to your full movement horizontally in this fashion (so long as the wall is wide enough), even if that distance, plus your falling distance, exceeds your normal movement rate.
Roofwalker						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility				PRESKILL:2,Balance=5,Jump=5																					DESC:You are adept at moving and fighting on rooftops and ledges.																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:63	BENEFIT:You gain 3 maneuvers. Fleet of Feet - you can walk across a precarious surface at full speed without taking a -5 penalty on your Balance check. Graceful Drop - If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you fell. If you succeed on your jump check, it subracts 20 feet from the distance instead of 10. Master of the Roof - You know how to use the slopes to your advantage. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against any opponent on a different elevation than you.
Scult Spell						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																													DESC:You can alter the are of your spells.																																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																																								SOURCEPAGE:63	BENEFIT:You can modify an area spell by changing the area's shape to either a cylinder (10-foot radius, 30 feet high), a 40-foot cone, four 10-foot cubes, a ball (20-footradius spread), or a 120-foot line. A sculpted spell works normally in all respects except for its shape. For example, a lightning bolt whose area is changed to a ball deals the same amount of damage, but affects a 20-foot-radius spread.
Special Dispensation				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Favored																															DESC:You have been given leave to carry even banned armor, weapons, and equipment in a given area.																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:63	BENEFIT:Due in part to your standing within your organization, you have received special dispensation from the authorities to wear or carry whatever equipment you deem necessary, regardless of local armor and weapons laws. This feat is often represented in the game, either by an object of some kind-typically an official government seal-or even a mark, such as a tattoo.
Strong Stomach					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Endurance										PRESTAT:1,CON=13																		DESC:You have greater resilience to illness and foul odors than most people.																																																																			BONUS:VAR|RageSicknessPenalty|1												SOURCEPAGE:64	BENEFIT:You reduce the effects of sickening and nausea by one step. You cannot become nauseated. If you are exposed to an effect or condition that would normally make you nauseated, you become sickened instead. If an effect or condition would normally sicken you, that effect is negated.
Swift Tumbler					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																									PRESKILL:1,Tumble=7																						DESC:You can flip, twist, and roll with great speed. You might have learned this by traversing the city's rooftops or simply by moving through the throng day after day.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:64	BENEFIT:When tumbling, you move at a a speed equal to half your base speed + 10 feet.
Urban Tracking					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General					VISIBLE:YES																																																		DESC:You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities.																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:64	BENEFIT:To find an individual's trail, or to follow a trail for 1 hour, requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour you search, as well as each time the trail becomes more difficult to follow, such as when it takes you to a different part of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down you quarry, depends on the community size and the prevailing conditions. If you fail a check, you can retru after 1 hour of questioning, the DM should  the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn't know exactly how much time the task will require. You can cut the time between Gather Information checks in half (from 1 hour to 30 minutes), but you take a -5 penalty on the check. Obviously, this feat will not allow you to locate someone who has gone beyond the boundaries of the community, but it could inform you that they've done so.
