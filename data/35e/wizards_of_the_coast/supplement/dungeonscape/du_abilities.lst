###Block: Factotum
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Factotum ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Factotum Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:A factotum is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).

Inspiration				KEY:Factotum ~ Inspiration				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Factotum Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Inspiration	SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:The factotum is a dabbler, a professional explorer who plunders a wide variety of fields to find the tools he needs to survive. He reads through tomes of arcane magic to gain a basic understanding of spells. He offers prayers to a variety of deities to gain their blessings. He observes warrior stances and exercises to understand the art of fighting. But while a factotum learns many paths, he masters none of them. Rather than train in a given field, he masters all the basics and manages to pull out something useful when the situation is desperate enough. To represent this seemingly random body of knowledge, a factotum gains inspiration points that he can spend to activate his abilities. At the beginning of each encounter, he gains a number of inspiration points determined by his level (see Table 1-1).

Cunning insight does not require an action, and you can use it as often as you wish during your turn or others' turns-provided that you have the inspiration points to spend.

Arcane Dilettante			KEY:Factotum ~ Arcane Dilettante			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Factotum Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.16	DESC:At 2nd level, you acquire a vague understanding of magic. You know that with a few weird hand gestures and an array of grunts and bizarre words, you can conjure up something that looks like a spell. By spending 1 inspiration point, you can mimic a spell as a spell-like ability. At the start of each day, choose a number of spells from the sorcerer/ wizard spell list based on your factotum level. You can choose one spell at 2nd level, and you gain additional spells as shown on Table 1-1. The maximum level of spell you can use, according to your class level, is also shown on the table. You can select any sorcerer/ wizard spell up to that level, but you can prepare only one spell of your maximum level. Your caster level equals your level in this character class. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell level + your Int modifier. Once you have used a spell, you cannot use it again until you have rested for 8 hours. After resting for this time, you choose new spells and lose any unused spells from the previous day, though you can select the same spell on consecutive days. You cannot prepare the same spell multiple times to use it more than once during the same day. You cannot use spells that require an XP cost. You must otherwise provide the necessary material components as normal. If you wish to enhance a spell with a metamagic feat, you must apply the feat when you prepare the spell.

Starting at 4th level, you can spend 1 inspiration point to gain 1d6 points of sneak attack damage. You must spend the inspiration point to activate this ability before making the attack roll.

Opportunistic Piety		KEY:Factotum ~ Opportunistic Piety			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Factotum Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:Factotums are legendary for the number of holy symbols, lucky trinkets, and blessed items they keep handy. As the saying goes, there are no atheists in the dungeon. Starting at 5th level, you can spend 1 inspiration point to channel divine energy as a standard action. You can use this energy to heal injuries, harm undead, or turn undead. At 5th level, you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom bonus (if any). You gain one extra daily use of this ability at 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level. You cannot use opportunistic piety if you have exhausted your daily uses, even if you have inspiration points left to spend. If you use this ability to heal injuries, you channel positive energy to heal a living creature of a number of points of damage equal to twice your factotum level + your Int modifier. The energy will also deal the same amount of damage to undead targets. If you use this ability to turn undead, you act as a cleric of a level equal to your factotum level. No matter what your alignment, you cannot control undead-your understanding of divine magic is too rudimentary.

Cunning Breach			KEY:Factotum ~ Cunning Breach				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Factotum Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:Starting at 11th level, your broad knowledge allows you to study an opponent and gain a brief flash of insight to breach her defenses. By spending 2 inspiration points as a free action, you can ignore a single target's spell resistance and damage reduction for 1 round. The target automatically fails any spell resistance check that she attempts to avoid your spell.
Cunning Dodge			KEY:Factotum ~ Cunning Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Factotum Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:Starting at 13th level, your luck, reflexes, and intuition allow you to avoid an attack or spell that would otherwise defeat you. If you take damage that would reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points, you can spend 4 inspiration points as an immediate action to ignore the damage. You dodge out of the way, take cover from a spell, or otherwise escape. You can use this ability once per day.

Cunning Brilliance		KEY:Factotum ~ Cunning Brilliance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Factotum Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.17	DESC:At 19th level, you become the ultimate jack of all trades. Your sharp mind and keen sense of your surroundings allow you to duplicate almost any ability you witness. At the start of each day, choose three extraordinary class abilities. Each ability must be available to a standard character class at 15th level or lower, and must appear on the advancement table or in the text description for that class. By spending 4 inspiration points as a free action, you gain the benefits and drawbacks of one chosen ability for 1 minute. You use the ability as if your level in the relevant class equaled your factotum level. You can use each chosen class ability once per day. For example, if you use a monk's flurry of blows ability, you gain all the benefits and drawbacks described under Flurry of Blows (PH 40). You do not gain the benefits of unarmed strike, because that is a separate ability in the monk's class description.

###Block: Beast Heart Adept
Monstrous Companion		KEY:Beast Heart Adept ~ Monstrous Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Beast Heart Adept Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:You gain the service of a monstrous companion. The creature is similar to a druid's animal companion (PH 35), but it is a magical beast or aberration rather than an animal. Choose one of the following as your monstrous companion: ankheg, blink dog, giant eagle, giant owl, hippogriff (4 Hit Dice), krenshar (4 Hit Dice), otyugh, owlbear, pegasus, or worg. Except for the hippogriff and the krenshar, which are larger than normal, the monster is typical of its kind. If its Intelligence is greater than 2, the companion has the same alignment as you. If you have levels in other classes (such as druid or ranger) that give you the ability to have an animal companion, those levels do not stack with your beast heart adept levels for the purpose of determining which kinds of monstrous companions you can select (and what the abilities of those companions are). At 3rd level or higher, you can select from alternative lists of monsters (see the sidebar). Just as with a druid's alternative animal companion, an alternative monstrous companion gains abilities as if your beast heart adept class level were lower than it actually is.

If you have the wild empathy ability from another class, add your levels in that class to your beast heart adept level when infl uencing magical beasts or animals.
