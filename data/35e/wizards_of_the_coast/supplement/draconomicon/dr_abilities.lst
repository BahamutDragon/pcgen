# Ability Name			Unique Key											Category of Ability		Type																	Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														Virtual Feat																																																		Ability																																																																																									Modify VAR																																																																																																													Source Page
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality							DESC:A bloodscaled fury gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Fearsome Presence			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Fearsome Presence						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:A bloodscaled fury is a terror to behold, and the seething fury that churns in its heart inspires terror in all who lay eyes on it. The dragon's frightful presence becomes more powerful: The saving throw DC to resist the ability is increased by the dragon's class level. Creatures with Hit Dice equal to or less than 1/2 the dragon's class level + 4 are panicked if they fail their saving throws, while creatures with more Hit Dice are shaken. Both fear effects last for 6d6 rounds (rather than the usual 4d6).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Draconic Fury			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Draconic Fury						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 2nd level, a bloodscaled fury's rage becomes more fearsome. While raging, its Strength and Constitution scores increase by an additional 2 points and it gains an additional +1 morale bonus on its Will saves. Thus, an 11th-level barbarian/2nd-level bloodscaled fury gains +8 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +4 on its Will saves. (Its Armor Class penalty remains at -2.) At 6th level, and again at 10th, these bonuses increase by a similar amount. An 11th-level barbarian/10th-level bloodscaled fury gains +12 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +6 on its Will saves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Scales of Blood			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Scales of Blood						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a bloodscaled fury earns its name. When it enters a rage, small quantities of blood ooze out around its scales, lining their edges and adding to the dragon's fearsome appearance. More important, the blood supernaturally wards the dragon from spells and weapon damage. For the duration of the dragon's rage, its spell resistance increases by its class level, and its damage reduction improves as well. The number before the slash in the dragon's damage reduction increases by 5 at 3rd level. In addition, at 7th level a bloodscaled fury's damage reduction can be overcome only by magic cold iron weapons, and at 11th level only by epic cold iron weapons. For example, an old white dragon with damage reduction 10/magic who reaches 3rd level as a bloodscaled fury gains damage reduction 15/magic while raging. At 7th level, it gains damage reduction 15/magic and cold iron while raging, and at 11th level it gains damage reduction 15/epic and cold iron while raging.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Rend					KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Rend								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality							DESC:At 4th level, a bloodscaled fury gains Rend (see page 73) as a bonus feat, even if it doesn't have the prerequisites.

SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Incite Rage				KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Incite Rage							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 8th level, a bloodscaled fury gains the ability to incite rage in its allies whenever it enters a rage. The dragon can affect all willing allies within 60 feet, granting them a +4 morale bonus to Strength, a +4 morale bonus to Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to Armor Class for as long as the dragon remains raging. This ability is otherwise identical to normal barbarian rage, including the fatigue at the end of the rage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Tireless Fury			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Tireless Fury						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 9th level, a bloodscaled fury no longer becomes fatigued at the end of its rage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.87
Blinding Speed			KEY:Bloodscaled Fury ~ Blinding Speed						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Bloodscaled Fury Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:A 12th-level bloodscaled fury can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 12 rounds each day. The duration of the effect need not be consecutive rounds. Activating this power is a free action.

SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Fiendbond				KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Fiendbond						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:As part of its initiation, a disciple of Ashardalon binds a demonic spirit to its own heart, emulating the manner in which Ashardalon himself took a balor as his heart. The dragon's alignment changes to chaotic evil if it was not already of that alignment. The dragon gains bonus sorcerer spells as if its Charisma score were 2 points higher than actual.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Resistance				KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Resistance						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:A disciple of Ashardalon gains resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire.

Its caster level is equal to its class level, and its saving throw DCs are 10 + its Cha modifier + spell level. Once an ability is gained, the disciple can use it a certain number of times per day, as follows: 3/day-darkness, poison, unholy aura; 1/day-blasphemy, contagion, desecrate, destruction, horrid wilting, unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.88
Skill Point Increase		KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Skill Point Increase				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 2nd level, and again at 10th level, a disciple of Ashardalon gains a pool of bonus skill points equal to the number of dragon Hit Dice it possesses. This pool represents a gradual transition from being a creature of the dragon type (with 6 skill points per HD) to being an outsider (with 8 skill points per HD). These bonus skill points are in addition to the skill points gained at every level, and are not modified by the dragon's Intelligence score.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Ability Increase			KEY:Disciple of Ashardalon ~ Ability Increase					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Disciple of Ashardalon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality						DESC:Every three levels, a disciple of Ashardalon's ability scores increase automatically. At 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level, its Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence all increase by 1 point. At 6th and 12th level, its Constitution and Charisma also increase by 1 point.

# Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:A dispassionate watcher gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Divine Conversion			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Divine Conversion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 1st level, a dispassionate watcher loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously gained by virtue of its age and draconic variety. Its effective divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels it sacrificed. These effective levels apply only to the dragon's spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such as turning undead). For example, a very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric adopts the dispassionate watcher of Chronepsis prestige class. Its sorcerer caster level of 11th converts into eleven effective cleric levels, giving the dragon the spellcasting ability of a 12th-level cleric.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Calming Aura			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Calming Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 1st level, a dispassionate watcher loses its frightful presence ability (if it had one), gaining instead an infectious aura of calm detachment. This aura has the same radius and Will save DC as the dragon's frightful presence ability, if it had one. If it did not possess frightful presence, the radius is equal to 5 feet per 2 HD the dragon possesses (counting only its base dragon Hit Dice, not any class levels). The Will saving throw to resist the effect has a DC of 10 + 1/2 dragon's base HD + its Cha modifier. The effect of the aura is the same as that of a calm emotions spell, but it lasts as long as the dispassionate watcher does not attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Draconic Knowledge		KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Draconic Knowledge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:A dispassionate watcher gains Draconic Knowledge (see page 69) as a bonus feat. It uses its dispassionate watcher level as an additional modifier on its draconic knowledge checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Spellcasting			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:From 2nd level on, when a new dispassionate watcher level is gained, the dragon gains new spells per day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. It does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (an improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essentially means that the dragon adds the level of dispassionate watcher to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a dispassionate watcher, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of dispassionate watcher for the purpose of determining spells per day. A very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level dispassionate watcher has the spellcasting ability of a 13th level cleric: 11 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to its effective divine spellcasting level. If the very old amethyst dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its spellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a 15th-level cleric.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Comprehend Languages		KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Comprehend Languages		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 2nd level, a dispassionate watcher gains the ability to use comprehend languages at will.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Stunning Rebuke			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Stunning Rebuke			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 4th-level dispassionate watcher can deliver a thunderous rebuke that stuns one creature of its choice within 100 feet. If the target creature fails a Will saving throw (DC 10 + dispassionate watcher's class level + 1/2 its Cha modifier), it is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. This is a sonic effect, but is not language-dependent.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Tongues				KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Tongues				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality		DESC:A 5th-level dispassionate watcher can use tongues at will.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Discern Lies			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Discern Lies			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 6th level, a dispassionate watcher knows when anyone (other than a deity) is deliberately lying. This ability is like the discern lies spell, except that it works continuously and applies to any creature the dragon can perceive.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Clearsight				KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Clearsight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 9th-level dispassionate watcher can see illusions, transmuted creatures and objects, and disguised creatures and objects for what they really are, provided they are within 30 feet of the dragon. This ability is similar to the true seeing spell, except that it also foils mundane disguises.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Vision				KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Vision				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 10th level, a dispassionate watcher gains the ability to use vision three times per day. Using this ability is only a standard action for the dragon.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.90
Analyze Dweomer			KEY:Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis ~ Analyze Dweomer			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dispassionate Watcher of Chronepsis Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality		DESC:A 12th-level dispassionate watcher can use analyze dweomer at will.

# Dragon Ascendant
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality							DESC:A dragon ascendant gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Awesome Aura			KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Awesome Aura							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:A dragon ascendant loses its innate frightful presence, replacing it with a special fear aura. This aura surrounds the dragon at any radius it chooses up to the extent of its frightful presence (30 feet - the dragon's age category), and is always active unless the dragon chooses to deactivate it. The dragon can choose to exclude its own allies from the effect of its aura. Creatures within the aura must make a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence DC plus 1/2 its dragon ascendant levels). Creatures that fail their saving throws are shaken, while those that succeed are immune to the effect of that dragon's aura for 24 hours. If the dragon attacks or charges, shaken creatures must attempt a second Will save (same DC) or become frightened. When a dragon ascendant reaches 5th level, it can choose to modify its aura to inspire resolve in its allies and dread in its enemies. All allies of the dragon within the radius of its aura receive a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and checks. The dragon's foes must succeed on a Will saving throw or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. When a dragon ascendant reaches 10th level, it gains a third option for its aura. The dragon can cause affected creatures to become dazed, simply staring at the dragon in fascinated awe, if they fail their Will saves. As with the fear aspect of the aura, the dragon can choose to exclude its allies from the effects of the aura. All uses of a dragon's awesome aura are mind-affecting effects.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Hit Point Increase		KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Hit Point Increase						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a dragon ascendant gains 1 hit point per Hit Die it possesses, including all its dragon Hit Dice and those gained from class levels. This benefit can never increase a dragon's hit points above the maximum for its Hit Dice and Constitution bonus. At 12th level, a dragon ascendant's hit points are equal to the maximum for its Hit Dice and Constitution bonus.

For example, an ancient black dragon/8th-level dragon ascendant has damage reduction 20/epic.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.92

SOURCEPAGE:p.92
Resistance to Fire		KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Resistance to Fire						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 11th level, a dragon ascendant gains resistance to fire 20, if it does not already possess immunity to fire.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.92

SOURCEPAGE:p.92
Immortality				KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Immortality							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:A 12th-level dragon ascendant is actually a quasi-deity, and can no longer die from natural causes. It does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. It can still be slain in physical or magical combat, and it is still subject to death from massive damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.92
Code of Conduct			KEY:Dragon Ascendant ~ Code of Conduct						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon Ascendant Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality							DESC:A dragon ascendant must be absolutely true to the principles of its alignment, whatever they may be. A dragon ascendant loses its awesome aura if it ever willingly commits an act opposed to its alignment (and it does not regain its frightful presence), and it cannot gain more levels as a dragon ascendant. The dragon can regain its awesome aura and once more advance in the dragon ascendant prestige class if it atones for its violations (see the atonement spell in the Player's Handbook), as appropriate.

Summon Elemental			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Summon Elemental						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality					DESC:Once per day, starting at 2nd level, an elemental master can use its breath weapon to summon a Medium elemental corresponding to its elemental subtype. The dragon breathes as normal, but in the wake of its breath the elemental appears, attacking in the next round. If it chooses, the dragon can instead summon an adult arrowhawk (air or cold), average salamander (fire), adult tojanida (water), or average xorn (earth). This ability works like the summon nature's ally V spell, with the dragon's class level as its caster level. A dragon with the cold subtype can summon a Medium water elemental or an adult tojanida. At 5th level, an elemental master can summon one Large elemental or two Medium elementals. This ability works like the summon nature's ally VI spell. At 8th level, an elemental master can summon one Huge elemental, two Large elementals, or four Medium elementals. Instead, the dragon can summon one elder arrowhawk, noble salamander, elder tojanida, or elder xorn, or four Medium creatures of the appropriate kind. This ability works like the summon nature's ally VII spell. At 11th level, an elemental master can summon one greater elemental, two Huge elementals, or four Large or Medium elementals. This ability works like the summon nature's ally VIII spell.

Energy Burst			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Energy Burst							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:A 4th-level elemental master can create a burst of damaging energy around its body. The burst consists of energy corresponding to the dragon's attuned energy type and has a radius of 5 feet per class level of the dragon. Anything in the area takes 1d8 points of damage per class level of the dragon. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + dragon's class level + its Con modifier) reduces the damage by half. Creating an energy burst counts as a use of the dragon's breath weapon. It cannot breathe or create another burst for 1d4 rounds after creating a burst.

Energy Storm			KEY:Elemental Master ~ Energy Storm							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Elemental Master Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:A 7th-level elemental master can surround itself with a vortex of swirling energy corresponding to the dragon's attuned energy type. The vortex extends from the dragon in an emanation with a radius of 5 feet per class level. The effect stops attacks with thrown weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by creatures inside the area, or if targeted at creatures within the area, or if their paths take them through the area. The storm deals 2 points of damage per class level to every unprotected creature within its area each round. The storm lasts for 1 round per class level (though the dragon can dismiss it as a move action), and counts as two uses of the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon cannot use its breath weapon (or its energy burst ability) while the storm is in place and for 2d4 rounds after it subsides.

Extra Energy Immunity		KEY:Hidecarved Dragon ~ Extra Energy Immunity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hidecarved Dragon Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 6th level, a hidecarved dragon gains immunity to an energy type it was already resistant to. Its resistance to one other energy type it has resistance 10 against increases to 20, and it gains resistance 10 against a third energy type. For this third energy type, a dragon with the fire subtype cannot choose cold, and a dragon with the cold subtype cannot choose fire. The gold hidecarved dragon from the earlier example could become immune to electricity at 6th level, increase its acid resistance to 20, and gain resistance to sonic 10. At 12th level, a hidecarved dragon's energy resistances and immunities improve again. Its resistance 20 becomes immunity, its resistance 10 becomes resistance 20, and it gains resistance 10 to all other energy types (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic) that it is not already immune or resistant to. The gold hidecarved dragon example, at 12th level, would have immunity to fire (naturally), electricity (since 6th level), and acid.

Divine Conversion			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Divine Conversion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 1st level, a sacred warder loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously gained by virtue of its age and draconic variety. Its effective divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels it sacrificed, allowing the dragon to cast cleric spells much more effectively. These effective levels apply only to the dragon's spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such as turning undead or wild shape). For example, a very old gold dragon/1st-level cleric adopts the sacred warder of Bahamut prestige class. Its sorcerer caster level of 13th converts into thirteen effective cleric levels, giving the dragon the spellcasting ability of a 14th-level cleric.

Smite Evil Dragons		KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Smite Evil Dragons				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:Once per day, a sacred warder of Bahamut of at least 2nd level may attempt to smite an evil dragon with one normal melee attack. It adds its Charisma bonus to its attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. If the sacred warder accidentally smites a dragon that is not evil, or a creature that is not a dragon, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. A sacred warder can smite any creature of the dragon type that has an evil alignment. At 6th level, a sacred warder may smite evil dragons twice per day, and at 10th level it can do so three times per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.96
Spellcasting			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Spellcasting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality					DESC:From 2nd level on, when a new sacred warder level is gained, the dragon gains new spells per day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. It does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (an improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essentially means that the dragon adds the level of sacred warder to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a sacred warder, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of sacred warder for the purpose of determining spells per day. A very old gold dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level sacred warder has the spellcasting ability of a 15th-level cleric: 13 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to its effective divine spellcasting level. If the very old gold dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its spellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a 17th-level cleric.

Aura of Courage			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Aura of Courage					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 3rd level, a sacred warder becomes immune to fear effects. In addition, the dragon's frightful presence ability alters so that it inspires allies as well as striking terror into enemies. Allies within the radius of the dragon's aura (30 feet - its age category) are unaffected by the dragon's frightful presence and receive a morale bonus on their saving throws against fear equal to the dragon's class level + its Cha modifier. Allies within the aura cannot be panicked by an evil dragon's frightful presence, regardless of their Hit Dice. Enemies within the aura are affected normally by the dragon's frightful presence.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.97
Sacred Shield			KEY:Sacred Warder of Bahamut ~ Sacred Shield					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Sacred Warder of Bahamut Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 7th level, a sacred warder gains the ability to surround itself with a protective aura that lasts 10 minutes and protects the dragon's body and equipment from attacks. The shield absorbs 10 points of damage per class level. Once the shield absorbs that much damage, it collapses. The damage can be from any source-weapons, spells, any energy type, and so on. Damage the dragon would not take anyway (fire damage against a gold dragon, for example, or weapon damage blocked by the dragon's damage reduction) does not count against the damage absorbed by the shield. The dragon can use this ability three times per day.

Its effective divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels it sacrificed, allowing the dragon to cast cleric spells much more effectively. These effective levels apply only to the dragon's spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such as turning undead or wild shape). For example, a very old red dragon/1st-level cleric adopts the unholy ravager of Tiamat prestige class.

If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an unholy ravager, the dragon must decide to which class it adds each level of unholy ravager for the purpose of determining spells per day. A very old red dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level unholy ravager has the spellcasting ability of a 15th-level cleric: 13 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the prestige class. If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to its effective divine spellcasting level.

Aura of Despair			KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Aura of Despair					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 3rd level, an unholy ravager's frightful presence alters slightly. In addition to the fear effect, creatures within the radius of the dragon's frightful presence take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty is applied before creatures roll their saving throws against the frightful presence effect itself.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.98
Profane Blast			KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Profane Blast					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 7th level, an unholy ravager of Tiamat can unleash a narrow blast of raw profane energy from its mouth three times per day. The blast is a ray, requiring a ranged touch attack, with a range of 400 feet + 40 feet per class level. The blast looks and feels like energy of the same type as the dragon's breath weapon. If it hits a target, it deals the same number of dice worth of damage as the dragon's breath weapon, but uses d12s. (So, a great wyrm blue dragon would deal 24d12 points of damage with its profane blast.) The damage it deals results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by protection from energy and similar magic. Each use of this ability counts as a use of the dragon's breath weapon, so it cannot use its breath weapon for 1d4 rounds after issuing a profane blast. An unholy ravager can target a creature behind a wall of force, prismatic wall, or prismatic sphere with its profane blast. The dragon makes a special dispel check, rolling 1d20 + its age category + its class level against a DC of 11 + the effect's caster level. If this check is successful, the effect is instantly negated (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed) and the ray goes on to strike the intended target (if the ranged touch attack roll is successful). A profane blast is stopped normally by a sacred warder of Bahamut's sacred shield.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.99
Mass Profane Blast		KEY:Unholy Ravager of Tiamat ~ Mass Profane Blast				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Unholy Ravager of Tiamat Class Feature.Class Features.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 12th level, an unholy ravager of Tiamat's profane blast occupies the same area as its breath weapon and affects all creatures within that area. The dragon can choose whether to use a ray profane blast or a mass profane blast, and can use both abilities no more than a total of three times per day. If a wall of force or prismatic effect is within the area of a mass profane blast, the dragon makes a special dispel check as described above for each such effect within the area.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, and so on). This essentially means that the character adds the level of dracolyte to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.

Prestige Domain				KEY:Dracolyte ~ Prestige Domain												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dracolyte Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 1st level, a dracolyte gains access to a prestige domain based on his alignment. Goodaligned dracolytes (and neutral clerics who channel positive energy) gain access to the Glory prestige domain (and its granted power), while evil-aligned dracolytes (and neutral clerics who channel negative energy) gain access to the Domination prestige domain (and its granted power). Dracolytes who are neither good nor evil (and who don't channel positive or negative energy) can select either of these domains, but once made, the choice can never be altered. The spells associated with the prestige domain can be selected to fill any domain spell slots the dracolyte has available. If the prestige domain is the character's only domain, he gains the ability to cast a domain spell of each spell level to which he has access once per day, in addition to those spells he already casts.

Scales					KEY:Dragonkith ~ Scales														CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:A dragonkith, over time, develops crusty scales the same color as her dragon companion. At 1st level, this protection adds +1 to the natural armor bonus of the dragonkith, and its natural armor bonus improves by an additional +1 every three levels. If the dragonkith already has natural armor as an aspect of its creature kind (and not from a spell or magic item), this bonus stacks with its existing natural armor bonus.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.124
Telepathic Plea				KEY:Dragonkith ~ Telepathic Plea												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Wherever a dragonkith is, its dragon companion can send an instantaneous, telepathic plea for help at any time. No details are provided in the message, other than that the dragon is in danger. This communication does not work both ways (the dragonkith cannot alert the dragon).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.124
Mighty Attack				KEY:Dragonkith ~ Mighty Attack												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 2nd level, once per day, a dragonkith can call upon its dragon's might to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on a single attack. The dragonkith must decide before an attack is resolved whether it will use this power. If the attack misses, that use of the mighty attack is wasted. For every three levels beyond 2nd, the damage increases by another 1d6.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.124
Detect Treasure				KEY:Dragonkith ~ Detect Treasure												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Once per day, a dragonkith of 3rd level or higher can use a detect treasure ability. This works like the detect magic spell, except that it senses Medium or smaller objects that are worth more than 100 gp. On the first round, the dragonkith detects the presence of such objects; on the second round, the power reveals the number of objects and the location of each. In each subsequent round, the dragonkith can make an Appraise check to estimate the value of one object.

Energy Resistance				KEY:Dragonkith ~ Energy Resistance												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:A dragonkith develops an ever stronger resistance to the energy associated with its dragon companion's breath weapon. Beginning at 3rd level, it can ignore some damage of the type generated by its dragon companion's breath weapon. This ability applies to sources of the energy type other than the dragon companion's breath weapon. Thus, a dragonkith with a red dragon companion gains resistance to fire 5 at 3rd level, effective against fire from any source. This resistance improves to 10 at 7th level and to 15 at 9th level. In the case of dragons with multiple breath weapons, the dragonkith gains resistance to one type of damaging breath.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.124
Telepathic Link				KEY:Dragonkith ~ Telepathic Link												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 4th level, a dragonkith develops a telepathic link with its companion dragon out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The dragonkith and dragon can communicate telepathically. Because of this link, one has the same connection to an item or place that the other does. For instance, if the dragonkith has seen a room, its dragon companion can teleport into that room as if she had seen it too.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.124
Sorcerous Knack				KEY:Dragonkith ~ Sorcerous Knack												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 6th level, a dragonkith acquires the ability to cast a single arcane spell once per day as a sorcerer of its class level.

Once the spell is chosen, that decision can never be changed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.124
Share Spells				KEY:Dragonkith ~ Share Spells													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonkith Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At either the dragon's or the dragonkith's option, any spell one casts on itself also affects the other. The two must be touching at the time. If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, the spell stops affecting them if they move farther than 100 feet apart. The spell's effect will not be restored even if they return to each other before the duration would otherwise have ended. The dragon and dragonkith can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of their respective types.

In addition, any dragon ridden by a dragonrider enjoys maneuverability of one grade better than normal (maximum perfect maneuverability). For instance, an adult green dragon with a dragonrider astride it has average maneuverability rather than poor.

SOURCEPAGE:p.126
Spellcasting				KEY:Dragonslayer ~ Spellcasting												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonslayer Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Each time a character attains an oddnumbered dragonslayer level, the character gains new spells per day and spells known as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that the character adds the level of dragonslayer to the level of whatever spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character takes one or more levels in this class before having any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receive this spellcasting benefit. If he thereafter takes levels in one or more spellcasting classes, he becomes eligible to receive the spellcasting benefit for any level in the dragonslayer class that he has not already attained. For example, a 5th-level fighter/1st-level dragonslayer does not receive the spellcasting benefit for being a 1st-level dragonslayer because he did not belong to a spellcasting class before taking a level in the prestige class. If he then picks up one or more levels of wizard before advancing to 3rd level in the dragonslayer class, he receives the spellcasting benefit of a 3rd-level dragonslayer (when he attains that level) but does not receive the 1stlevel benefit retroactively.																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.126

# Dragonsong Lyrist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Dragonsong Lyrist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonsong Lyrist Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A dragonsong lyrist gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Greater Dragonsong			KEY:Dragonsong Lyrist ~ Greater Dragonsong					SORTKEY:Greater Dragonsong 1	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonsong Lyrist Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Once per day per class level, a dragonsong lyrist can use song or poetics to invoke the power of dragonsong. Invoking dragonsong requires a standard action. In the case of effects that require a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + lyrist' class level + lyrist's Cha modifier. The bonus from the Dragonsong feat also applies to this save DC. In cases where the character continues a greater dragonsong effect over the course of multiple rounds (such as song of strength), the dragonsong lyrist can fight while using greater dragonsong but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word (such as wands). Maintaining a greater dragonsong effect does not require concentration. A deaf dragonsong lyrist has a 20%% chance to fail when using greater dragonsong. If she fails, the attempt still counts against her daily limit.																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Spellcasting				KEY:Dragonsong Lyrist ~ Spellcasting											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonsong Lyrist Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Each time an even-numbered dragonsong lyrist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day and spells known as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that the character adds 1/2 her dragonsong lyrist level to the level of whatever spellcasting class she has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character takes two or more levels in this class before having any levels in a spellcasting class, she does not receive this spellcasting benefit. If she thereafter takes levels in one or more spellcasting classes, she becomes eligible to receive the spellcasting benefit for any level in the dragonsong lyrist class that she has not already attained. For example, a 6th-level monk/2nd-level dragonsong lyrist does not receive the spellcasting benefit for being a 2ndlevel dragonsong lyrist because she did not belong to a spellcasting class before taking 2nd level in the prestige class. If she then picks up one or more levels of wizard before advancing to 4th level in the dragonsong lyrist class, she receives the spellcasting benefit of a 4th-level dragonsong lyrist (when she attains that level) but does not receive the 2nd-level benefit retroactively.

The dragonsong lyrist and all allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength for the duration of the lyrist's performance and for 5 rounds thereafter.

SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Song of Compulsion			KEY:Greater Dragonsong ~ Song of Compulsion					SORTKEY:Greater Dragonsong 3	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Greater Dragonsong Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 2nd level, a dragonsong lyrist can use her greater dragonsong to make a suggestion to a single creature within 30 feet who can hear the lyrist. A Will save negates the effect. This is an enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting, language-dependent) effect. Dragons take a -2 penalty on this saving throw.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Song of Flight				KEY:Greater Dragonsong ~ Song of Flight						SORTKEY:Greater Dragonsong 4	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Greater Dragonsong Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A 3rd-level dragonsong lyrist can grant herself and her allies the ability to fly, as the spell of the same name. This song affects the character and a number of allies equal to her Charisma modifier (all of whom must be able to hear the lyrist) and lasts for 1 minute per level. This is a transmutation effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Song of Fear				KEY:Greater Dragonsong ~ Song of Fear						SORTKEY:Greater Dragonsong 5	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Greater Dragonsong Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 4th level, a dragonsong lyrist can use her song or poetics to inspire fear in her foes. All enemies within a radius of 30 feet - class level are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragonsong lyrist. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save remains immune to that dragonsong lyrist's frightful presence ability for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with fewer than half the dragonsong lyrist's HD become panicked for 2d6 rounds and those with HD equal to or greater than half the dragonsong lyrist's become shaken for 2d6 rounds. Dragons are immune to this ability, as are any creatures immune to fear. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Each ally within 30 feet who can hear the dragonsong lyrist regains hit points and ability points as if he or she had rested for a full day. No character may benefit from this ability more than once per hour.

# Dragonstalker
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Dragonstalker ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonstalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A dragonstalker gains proficiency with the longbow, longspear, net, shortbow, and all simple weapons. Dragonstalkers are proficient with light armor and with shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.129
Hunting Bonus				KEY:Dragonstalker ~ Hunting Bonus												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragonstalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Starting at 1st level, a dragonstalker gains a bonus equal to her class level on Bluff, Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks when using these skills against dragons.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.129
Sneak Attack (Dragon)			KEY:Dragonstalker ~ Sneak Attack (Dragon)											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragonstalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, if a dragonstalker catches a dragon when it is unable to defend itself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, any time the dragonstalker's target would be denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (whether it actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the dragonstalker's attack deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by 2d6 points every other level (4d6 at 4th level, 6d6 at 6th level, and so on). Should the dragonstalker score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the dragon is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a dragonstalker can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon to execute the sneak attack. A dragonstalker can only sneak attack living dragons with discernible anatomies. Any dragon immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the dragonstalker must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. A dragonstalker cannot sneak attack while striking at a dragon with concealment or by striking the limbs of a dragon whose vitals are beyond reach. If a dragonstalker gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack when the ability is used against dragons.																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.129
Ignore Natural Armor			KEY:Dragonstalker ~ Ignore Natural Armor											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragonstalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Once per day, a dragonstalker of 3rd level or higher can ignore a target's natural armor bonus (including any enhancement to that natural armor) for one attack (melee or ranged). You must declare that you are using this ability before you make the attack roll. At 7th level, a dragonstalker can use this ability twice per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.129
Hide Scent					KEY:Dragonstalker ~ Hide Scent												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Dragonstalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 5th level, a dragonstalker can use the Disguise skill to hide her (or someone else's) scent. This requires a Disguise check (with a -10 penalty) opposed by a Wisdom check made by any creature attempting to use the scent ability to discover the dragonstalker's presence. Hiding one's scent requires twice as long as a typical Disguise check (1d3-20 minutes), and the effect lasts for 1 hour per class level. Magic that alters your form doesn't affect this Disguise check.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.129
Foil Blindsense				KEY:Dragonstalker ~ Foil Blindsense												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonstalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Once per day, a 9th-level dragonstalker can render herself completely imperceptible to blindsense. This requires a standard action, and the effect lasts for 10 minutes. This ability has no effect on other forms of vision (whether mundane or magical). For instance, it doesn't keep someone from spotting or hearing the dragonstalker with normal senses, or from noticing an invisible dragonstalker by means of a true seeing spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.129
Dragonstrike				KEY:Dragonstalker ~ Dragonstrike												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Dragonstalker Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 10th level, the effective enhancement bonus of any weapon wielded by a dragonstalker against a dragon is +2 better than normal, and the weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against dragons. This benefit stacks with the enhancement bonus increase and bonus damage dice from a weapon with the bane (dragons) special ability.

Spells					KEY:Hoardstealer ~ Spells													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hoardstealer Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a hoardstealer gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, the hoardstealer must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a hoardstealer with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Hoardstealer bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the hoardstealer's Int modifier. When the hoardstealer gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level hoardstealer), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The hoardstealer's spell list appears below. A hoardstealer casts spells just as a wizard does.

Trapfinding					KEY:Hoardstealer ~ Trapfinding												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hoardstealer Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Like a rogue, a hoardstealer can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a DC higher than 20. He may also use the Disable Device skill to disarm a magic trap. A hoardstealer who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with his party) without disarming it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.131
Hide from Dragons				KEY:Hoardstealer ~ Hide from Dragons											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Hoardstealer Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:A 2nd-level hoardstealer can cast hide from dragons on himself once per day. This functions as the spell of the same name (see page 113), except that it only affects the hoardstealer and lasts for only 1 round per level. At 6th level, the hoardstealer may use this ability twice per day. At 10th level, he may use it three times per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.131
Trap Sense					KEY:Hoardstealer ~ Trap Sense													CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hoardstealer Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a hoardstealer gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +2 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps.

The container's weight remains the same, but it becomes capable of holding up to 10 cubic feet (or 100 pounds) of material per level. The duration of this effect is 1 hour per level. If the effect ends prematurely (such as by being dispelled), everything within the container spills out onto the floor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.131
Treasure Dowsing				KEY:Hoardstealer ~ Treasure Dowsing												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Hoardstealer Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Once per day, a 4th-level hoardstealer can concentrate (a full-round action) to detect the location of the largest mass of metal or minerals within a range of 10 feet per level. If the hoardstealer concentrates on a specific metal or mineral (such as gold or diamonds), he detects the location of each such deposit within range. This is otherwise identical to the effect of a rod of metal and mineral detection (see page 236 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). At 7th level, the hoardstealer may use this ability twice per day. At 10th level, he may use it three times per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.131
Skill Mastery				KEY:Hoardstealer ~ Skill Mastery												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Hoardstealer Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 8th level, a hoardstealer may select a number of skills equal to 3 + his Int modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, the hoardstealer may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so.

The initiate can activate her frightful presence as a free action. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet per point of Charisma modifier (minimum 30 feet) are subject to the effect if they have fewer Hit Dice than the initiate (dragons are immune to the effect).

SOURCEPAGE:p.133

SOURCEPAGE:p.133
Timeless Body				KEY:Initiate of the Draconic Mysteries ~ Timeless Body								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Initiate of the Draconic Mysteries Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:After attaining 9th level, an initiate no longer takes ability score penalties for aging (see Table 6-5: Aging Effects, page 109 of the Player's Handbook) and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the initiate still dies of old age when her time is up.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.133
Dragon Shape				KEY:Initiate of the Draconic Mysteries ~ Dragon Shape									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Initiate of the Draconic Mysteries Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 10th level, an initiate of the draconic mysteries gains the ability to use a shapechange ability once per day to take the form of a dragon, from Tiny to Huge size, for 1 hour. Once a form is assumed, it cannot be changed except to return to normal (which dismisses the effect).

# Platinum Knight
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Platinum Knight ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A platinum knight is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.133
Smite Evil Dragon				KEY:Platinum Knight ~ Smite Evil Dragon											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Once per day, a platinum knight may attempt to smite an evil dragon with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 2 extra points of damage per level. If a platinum knight accidentally smites a creature that is not an evil dragon, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. The bonuses from this ability don't stack with other smite abilities, such as the paladin's smite evil. Every three levels beyond 1st, the platinum knight gains one additional daily use of this ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.133
Immune to Frightful Presence		KEY:Platinum Knight ~ Immune to Frightful Presence									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Platinum knights are treated as dragons for the purpose of being immune to the frightful presence of dragons and similar creatures.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.133
Spellcasting				KEY:Platinum Knight ~ Spellcasting												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:When an even-numbered platinum knight level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds 1/2 his platinum knight level to the level of some other spellcasting class he has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character takes two or more levels in this class before having any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receive this spellcasting benefit. If he thereafter takes levels in one or more spellcasting classes, he becomes eligible to receive the spellcasting benefit for any level in the platinum knight class that he has not already attained. For example, a 6thlevel fighter/2nd-level platinum knight does not receive the spellcasting benefit for being a 2nd-level platinum knight because he did not belong to a spellcasting class before taking 2nd level in the prestige class. If he then picks up one or more levels of wizard before advancing to 4th level in the platinum knight class, he receives the spellcasting benefit of a 4th-level platinum knight (when he attains that level) but does not receive the 2nd-level benefit retroactively.																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.134
Platinum Scales				KEY:Platinum Knight ~ Platinum Scales											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 3rd level, a platinum knight's skin takes on a slightly metallic sheen. He gains a +1 increase to his natural armor bonus. At 7th level, this increase improves to +2.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.134
Bahamut's Grace				KEY:Platinum Knight ~ Bahamut's Grace											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A 5th-level platinum knight adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws against the attacks, special abilities, and spells cast by evil dragons. This effect stacks with the divine grace class feature of paladins and similar abilities.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.134
Charisma Bonus				KEY:Platinum Knight ~ Charisma Bonus											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 9th level, a platinum knight's Charisma increases by 2 points.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.134
True Seeing					KEY:Platinum Knight ~ True Seeing												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Platinum Knight Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 10th level, a platinum knight gains the ability to see all things as they actually are. This ability is the equivalent of the true seeing spell and lasts for 1 hour. A platinum knight may use true seeing once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.134

# Talon of Tiamat
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A talon of Tiamat is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.134
Breath Weapon				KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Breath Weapon												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 1st level, a talon of Tiamat gains the ability to breathe out a cone of frost (size of the cone corresponds to the size of the character) that deals 3d6 points of cold damage. As the talon gains levels, additional versions of his breath weapon become available to him. At 3rd level, the talon can breathe a line of acid (8d4 acid damage). At 5th level, he can breathe a cone of corrosive gas (10d6 acid damage). At 7th level, he can expel a line of lightning (12d8 electricity damage). At 9th level, he can breathe a cone of fire (14d8 fire damage). In each case, a successful Reflex save halves the damage dealt. The DC for saves against the talon's breath weapon is 10 + talon class level + Con modifier. A talon of Tiamat can use each of his breath weapons once per day. Once a talon uses any of his breath weapons, he can't use any other breath weapon until 1d4 rounds have passed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.134
Spellcasting				KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Spellcasting												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:When an even-numbered talon of Tiamat level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that he adds 1/2 his talon of Tiamat level to the level of some other spellcasting class he has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character takes two or more levels in this class before having any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receive this spellcasting benefit. If he thereafter takes levels in one or more spellcasting classes, he becomes eligible to receive the spellcasting benefit for any level in the talon of Tiamat class that he has not already attained. For example, a 7th-level fighter/2nd-level talon of Tiamat does not receive the spellcasting benefit for being a 2nd-level talon of Tiamat because he did not belong to a spellcasting class before taking 2nd level in the prestige class. If he then picks up one or more levels of wizard before advancing to 4th level in the talon of Tiamat class, he receives the spellcasting benefit of a 4th-level talon of Tiamat (when he attains that level) but does not receive the 2nd-level benefit retroactively.																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.135
Voice of the Dragon			KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Voice of the Dragon											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 2nd level, a talon of Tiamat gains a +2 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks. This bonus increases by +2 every four levels thereafter, to +4 at 6th level and +6 at 10th level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.135
Keen Senses					KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Keen Senses												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A talon of Tiamat gains low-light vision at 4th level.

SOURCEPAGE:p.135
Immunities					KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Immunities												CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 6th level, a talon of Tiamat gains immunity to magic sleep and paralysis effects. In addition, he gains immunity to one of the following forms of energy, at his option: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Once an energy immunity is selected, the decision may never be changed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.135
Frightful Presence			KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Frightful Presence											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:An 8th-level talon of Tiamat can unsettle foes with his mere presence. The talon of Tiamat can activate his frightful presence as a free action. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet per point of Charisma modifier (minimum 30 feet) are subject to the effect if they have fewer Hit Dice than the talon of Tiamat (dragons are immune to the effect). A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + talon's class level + talon's Cha modifier) remains immune to that talon's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 2d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 2d6 rounds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.135
Dominate Dragon				KEY:Talon of Tiamat ~ Dominate Dragon											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Talon of Tiamat Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A 10th-level talon of Tiamat can attempt to dominate any dragon (as dominate monster, but it only applies to dragons) once per day. The target may attempt a Will save to negate the effect (DC 10 + talon's class level + talon's Cha modifier).

# 168
#Frightful Presence (Ex): Much like the chromatic and metallic dragons, landwyrms can unsettle their foes with their mere presence. This ability takes effect automatically whenever the landwyrm attacks or charges. Creatures within the specified radius are subject to the effect if they are at least one size category smaller than the landwyrm and have fewer HD than the landwyrm. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 landwyrm's HD + landwyrm's Cha modifier) remains immune to that landwyrm's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures whose HD are less than half the landwyrm's HD become panicked for 2d6 rounds and those whose HD are equal to or more than half the landwyrm's HD become shaken for 2d6 rounds. Other dragons (whether landwyrms or not) are immune to a landwyrm's frightful presence.

Breath Weapon		KEY:Dragon (Rust) ~ Breath Weapon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon (Rust) Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A rust dragon has two breath weapons: a line of acid or a cone of reddish-brown liquid that instantly corrodes and destroys any metal it touches. Attended and magical metals receive Reflex saves to avoid this effect, but any metal is susceptible: iron, steel, silver, gold, even mithral and adamantine.
Metal Resistance		KEY:Dragon (Rust) ~ Metal Resistance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon (Rust) Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A rust dragon is resistant to attacks from metal weapons. Against weapons whose damage-dealing part is metal (a blade, metal point, arrowhead, or even mace head), a rust dragon has damage reduction equal to what a rust dragon two age categories older than itself has. Wyrm and great wyrm rust dragons have damage reduction 20/magic and 10/chaotic against metal weapons, and lesser weapons corrode when used against them (see Rusting Scales, below).
Rusting Bite		KEY:Dragon (Rust) ~ Rusting Bite					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon (Rust) Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A rust dragon that makes a successful bite attack causes metal armor worn by the target creature to corrode, falling to pieces and becoming useless immediately. A dragon can also use its bite attack to target a weapon or other metal object, of course. The size of the object is immaterial- a full suit of armor rusts away as quickly as a sword. Magic metal items are allowed Reflex saves against a DC equal to the dragon's breath weapon save DC.
Rusting Scales		KEY:Dragon (Rust) ~ Rusting Scales					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon (Rust) Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A metal weapon with less than a +5 enhancement bonus that hits a wyrm or great wyrm rust dragon corrodes and is destroyed immediately, with no saving throw. A +5 weapon deals damage normally, but then must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to the dragon's breath weapon save DC) or rust away.

Breath Weapon		KEY:Dragon (Shadow) ~ Breath Weapon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon (Shadow) Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A shadow dragon's breath weapon is a cone of billowing, smoky shadows with an energy drain effect. Creatures within the cone gain the number of negative levels indicated on the Shadow Dragons by Age table; the saving throw to remove the negative level is given on the table as well. A successful Reflex save (against the same DC) reduces the number of negative levels by half (round down).
Shadow Blend		KEY:Dragon (Shadow) ~ Shadow Blend					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon (Shadow) Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a very young or older shadow dragon can disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment. Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this ability. A daylight spell, however, does.
Create Shadows		KEY:Dragon (Shadow) ~ Create Shadows				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dragon (Shadow) Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Three times per day, a great wyrm shadow dragon can conjure a mass of leaping shadows with a radius of 100 yards and a duration of 1 hour (this is a creation effect). All normal and magical light sources are negated within this radius. All characters and creatures gain a +4 bonus on their Hide checks within the shadows, and can hide even if directly observed. Shadow dragons and other creatures with ties to the Plane of Shadow gain total concealment within the shadows, though they can move and attack normally. Their attacks gain a +2 bonus and deny their opponents any Dexterity bonus to AC, because they are considered invisible.
