You protect the subject from low temperatures and cold energy with a thin layer of that energy's shadowy reflection. This grants the subject immunity to normal extremes of temperature and absorbs cold damage from attacks and effects. When an aura of shade absorbs a total of 12 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 120), it expires. For as long as the aura is active, the subject's weapon or natural weapon melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of cold damage.
Bend Perspective			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Bend Perspective			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Divination				SUBSCHOOL:Scrying											RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:1 minute/level (D)																			SOURCEPAGE:p.142	DESC:You send your vision through shadows and into planar reflections,altering your point of view. You view the world as though you were standing in a different spot, up to a maximum distance of 25 feet plus 5 feet per two caster levels. You cannot see through solid objects. You can, however, look around corners or over barriers, obtain a bird's-eye view of your area, and the like. Essentially, you shift your perspective as though you were located at any spot in range to which you have line of effect. You can switch back and forth between your own eyes and your alternate viewpoint as a swift action. You can move your alternate perspective, as in the spell arcane eye. Its speed is only 10 feet per round, however, and every round of such movement decreases the mystery's duration by 1 minute (if you move the perspective in the last minute of the duration, you gain a few seconds of vision at the new position before the effect expires).
Black Candle			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Black Candle				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Evocation									DESCRIPTOR:Light|Darkness				RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Object touched																								DURATION:1 round/level (D)							SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.142	DESC:You draw on extraplanar shadow or banish existing shadows to let in the light.

You create a shapeable shadowy curtain of black flame that covers the affected squares. the fire deals 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels to any creature standing in an affected square at the beginning of each of your turns until the effect ends. In addition, the flame deals damage to any creature entering or passing through an affected square. Black fire burns only a few feet tall, so a creature can avoid the effect of the mystery by jumping or flying over the area.

You grant the subject 5 temporary hit points for each of its Hit Dice (maximum 75). For the duration of the effect, the subject's shadow grows larger than normal, and its movements are very slightly uncoordinated with those of the subject. An observer can notice this characteristic by making a DC 20 Spot check.
Carpet of Shadow			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Carpet of Shadow			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Conjuration			SUBSCHOOL:Creation										RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One 5-ft. square/level (S)																						DURATION:1 minute/level (D)							SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.142	DESC:The ground becomes rough and hazardous, the real floor superimposed with irregular terrain of the Plane of Shadow. You cloak the ground with an uneven and hard to traverse surface. the terrain becomes difficult, meaning that each 5-foot square within the area costs double to move into. For instance, each light undergrowth square (normally costing 2 squares of movement to move into) now costs 4 squares of movement to move into. If you cast this mystery a second time on the same area (or a portion of the same area) while the first casting is still active, the second casting does not worsen the terrain further (although it would extend the duration of the effect on that area).

Creatures within the area become coated in these clinging shadows. Any creature within the area affected by this mystery, or that enters the area on its turn, must make a Reflex save or become immobilized (see page 140). Each round on its turn, an immobilized subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the condition. Because of the subject's condition, this save is a full-round action (but does not provoke attacks of opportunity). If an immobilized subject succeeds on its save, it still needs to save again at the start of its next turn in order to avoid succumbing to the darkness again.
Congress of Shadows		KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Congress of Shadows			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Divination									DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				RANGE:1 mile/level			TARGETAREA:One living creature whose exact location is known to you, or one living creature you know well whose approximate location (within 100 ft.) is known to you	DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)		SOURCEPAGE:p.143	DESC:You look toward your shadow and speak a few words knowing that some distance away, a subject hears them and might reply.

Curtain of Shadows		KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Curtain of Shadows			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Transmutation																RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Shadowy wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level (S)																	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)							SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.143	DESC:You create a wall of frigid shadow that blocks vision and wracks all who pass through it with cold. You create a wall of shadow that completely blocks line of sight. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

You grant subjects concealment. If you cast this mystery on a single subject, the shadows are thicker, and the subject gains total concealment. the spell see invisibility and the mystery piercing sight do not negate these miss chances, but the spell true seeing and the mystery truth revealed do.

You turn the dark energies from the Plane of Shadow upon another creature, compelling it to act in ways that it normally would not. While this effect is active, you can use a standard action to focus the shadow energies on one living creature within 30 feet that you select. the creature must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 17 + your Cha modifier) or immediately make a melee attack against one target within its reach.

With a grin, you manifest it in the physical world and hurl it back at him. You can "echo" a mystery or spell cast by anyone other than yourself, causing it to remanifest under your control. Both the caster and the effect must have been within echo spell's range, and the entire casting must have occurred in the previous round. You choose the mystery or spell's target, and make any other choices involved in casting it. You cast the mystery or spell using your mystery user level (use your Cha modifier to determine the mystery or spell's DC; its duration, saves, and the like are as normal for that spell). You cannot echo a mystery or spell of a higher level than the highest-level mystery you can cast, and you can never echo a mystery or a spell of higher than 4th level.

A creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). A creature wielding a reach weapon, such as a longspear, is not subject to this damage if it attacks you. If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect (unless you used the mystery as a supernatural ability). Damage from sharp shadows is not considered magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, and the effect is not considered a weapon for the purpose of spells such as align weapon or magic weapon.
Sight Eclipsed			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Sight Eclipsed				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Illusion				SUBSCHOOL:Glamer											RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:1 round/level (D)																			SOURCEPAGE:p.150	DESC:You cloak yourself in shadow and shift the light that would reveal you into the Plane of Shadow. While this mystery is in effect, you can attempt Hide checks even while being observed, just as if you had cover or concealment for the purpose of this determination.
Sight Obscured			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Sight Obscured				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Illusion				SUBSCHOOL:Glamer											RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																								DURATION:1 round/level (D)							SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)		SOURCEPAGE:p.150	DESC:You cloak the subject and her movements in subtly shifting shadow. This mystery grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Hide checks, Sleight of Hand checks, and any other checks that involve concealing the subject's actions or gestures.
Soul Puppet				KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Soul Puppet				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Enchantment			SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:One living creature touched																						DURATION:1 day/level (D)							SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.150	DESC:Tendrils of shadow creep from your fingers, through the Plane of Shadow, and into the soul of the subject by way of its own shadow. You now control the creature's actions as if it were a puppet. the control granted by soul puppet follows the same mechanics as the spell dominate monster. Anyone observing the subject with the spell true seeing, the mystery truth revealed, or a similar ability sees tendrils of darkness extending a few feet from the subject before fading into nothingness. Similarly, anyone observing you while using similar abilities notices tendrils extending from your fingers, also fading into nothing.
Steel Shadows			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Steel Shadows				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Abjuration																	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)																			SOURCEPAGE:p.150	DESC:Darkness coalesces about your body, forming a shadow-shape of armor and another that looks like a shield. Although they are as weightless as the air, you know they'll protect you as well as if they were made of steel. Steel shadows grants you a +3 armor bonus and a +3 shield bonus to AC, but without weight, armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. the effect is not a force effect, and attacks from incorporeal creatures ignore it.
Step into Shadow			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Step into Shadow			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Conjuration (Teleportation)														RANGE:Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures																	DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:None and Will negates (object)	SPELLRES:No and Yes (object)	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	DESC:You transport yourself through the Plane of Shadow to any spot within range. Your shadow stretches out from you until it reaches your chosen destination, passing through solid objects and moving independently of the ambient light. You appear to fall into your shadow at one end, and rise from it at the other. This mystery functions like the spell dimension door.
Summon Umbral Servant		KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Summon Umbral Servant		TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Conjuration			SUBSCHOOL:Summoning										RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One summoned creature																							DURATION:1 round/level (D)							SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.151	DESC:You summon a creature of shadow to serve you, calling it through the barriers between worlds. This mystery functions like the spell summon monster I, except as noted here. You can summon one Huge, two Large, or four Medium or smaller shadow elementals.
Thoughts of Shadow		KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Thoughts of Shadow			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Transmutation																RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																								DURATION:1 minute/level (D)							SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)		SOURCEPAGE:p.151	DESC:You open the subject's mind to shadow, and the new perceptions it offers. You grant the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You decide which ability you are enhancing when you cast the mystery, and you may not later alter your choice.
Tomb of Night			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Tomb of Night				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Conjuration			SUBSCHOOL:Creation																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.151	DESC:You temporarily banish your foe to the depths of shadow. This mystery functions like the mystery prison of night, except that instead of taking Constitution damage upon failing a Fortitude saving throw to escape the prison, the creature gains one negative level. In addition, tomb of night deals 3d6 points of cold damage per round.
Truth Revealed			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Truth Revealed				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Divination																	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:1 minute/level (D); see text																	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	DESC:By focusing on the spiritual shadow of the world, you can see hidden truths. At its most basic, this mystery functions like the spell true seeing. You can also, by concentrating on a particular creature or object for 1 minute or more, gain additional information on that subject. However, because of the distortion between worlds and the twisting effect of shadows, any additional information gained in this manner might be false or misleading. the table below indicates what other mystical effects can be duplicated with truth revealed. Concentrating on a specific target requires a substantial amount of time, during which you can only take move actions, and cannot focus on any other target. At the end of this period, the target makes a saving throw against the DC of truth revealed to resist the detection effect. Spell resistance applies to this further detection effect as well. You may not attempt any one effect on the same target more than once per use of truth revealed. Remember that these effects are in addition to the basic knowledge granted by true seeing, which occurs instantly and reliably.
Umbral Body				KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Umbral Body				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Transmutation																RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:1 round/level (D)																			SOURCEPAGE:p.152	DESC:You become a being of shadow, rather than one of substance. You gain the incorporeal subtype (see page 164) and all advantages and traits associated with it.
Umbral Hand				KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Umbral Hand				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Transmutation																RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One unattended object weighing up to 5 lb./level																			DURATION:1 round/level (D)							SAVEINFO:Will negates (object)		SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.152	DESC:You point your finger at a distant object, and the shadows seem to grasp and tug at it. This mystery functions like the spell mage hand, except you can manipulate heavier objects and magic items. Magic items are allowed a saving throw to negate the effect. You need not concentrate on the effect, but you must direct it with your thoughts once each round (a free action), or the effect ends.
Umbral Touch			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Umbral Touch				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Conjuration																RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature or creatures touched																						DURATION:1 minute/level (D); see text					SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial; see text	SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.152	DESC:Darkness surrounds your hand, turning it into a deadly weapon. Umbral touch infuses one of your hands with dark, shadowy energy, allowing you to make debilitating melee touch attacks. A successful strike deals 5d6 points of damage to a target, which must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or also be slowed. While this mystery is active, you threaten an area as if you were armed and can make attacks of opportunity with your umbral touch. This mystery completely occupies one of your hands, as if you were holding an object in that hand. If you have another open hand, you can cast other mysteries or spells normally, even those with a range of touch, but you cannot deliver another touch mystery or touch spell and make an attack with umbral touch in the same round. This effect normally lasts for 1 minute per level, but each successful touch attack shortens the duration by 1 minute (allowing you to make one successful attack per level before the effect is discharged).
Unravel Dweomer			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Unravel Dweomer			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Abjuration																	RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:Up to one creature/level, all within 30 ft. of each other																	DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:See text					SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.152	DESC:You open a conduit to the Plane of Shadow, leaching out the energy maintaining an ongoing magical effect. This mystery functions like the spell break enchantment.
Unveil				KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Unveil					TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Divination																	RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																								DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)		SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)		SOURCEPAGE:p.152	DESC:Reaching into the shadow of the creature, you grasp the shadows of the deleterious things that affect it and tear them away. This mystery immediately ends any of the following adverse conditions: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, immobilized, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. In addition, it negates the effects of the mysteries mesmerizing shade, shadow hood, and shadow between, and cancels curses as the spell remove curse.
Voice of Shadow			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Voice of Shadow			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Enchantment|Necromancy		SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion		DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent|Mind-Affecting	RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:One creature																									DURATION:1 round									SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.152	DESC:By speaking via a conduit through the Plane of Shadow, you deliver a commanding message. This mystery functions like the spell command. A second function is a necromancy effect. Undead and constructs that fail their saving throws against this effect are dazed for 1 round. You can only use one version of this mystery in a single casting.
Voyage into Shadow		KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Voyage into Shadow			TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Illusion (Shadow)															RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Up to one touched creature/level																					DURATION:1 hour/level (D)							SAVEINFO:Will negates				SPELLRES:Yes			SOURCEPAGE:p.153	DESC:You and other creatures you touch enter the Plane of Shadow for a brief span, using it as a means of crossing great distances on the Material Plane. This mystery functions like the spell shadow walk, except as noted here. Your movement rate on the Plane of Shadow is double that described by the spell. Further, upon reaching your destination, you can attempt a DC 30 Knowledge (the planes) check; success indicates that you appear exactly where you wish, rather than being shunted to a nearby space as per the spell. You need not leave the Plane of Shadow once you enter it, and this mystery can be used on the Plane of Shadow to travel rapidly.
Warp Spell				KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Warp Spell				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Abjuration																	RANGE:Close					TARGETAREA:A spell or mystery cast by someone else																				DURATION:Instantaneous								SAVEINFO:Will negates; see text		SPELLRES:No				SOURCEPAGE:p.153	DESC:You reach out with shadowy energies, banishing your foe's spell or mystery into the Plane of Shadow while replacing it with its dark reflection. You can cast this mystery as an immediate action to warp another caster's spell or mystery. In this case, warp spell must be used at the moment of the other caster's casting. To be successful, you must beat the other caster on an opposed caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If you do not, you have failed to take control of his spell or mystery, and it manifests normally. If you succeed on the opposed check, the other caster's mystery or spell is countered, as if you had used the counterspell action successfully, and you gain one additional use of an apprentice-path mystery that you know. You can keep this additional use until a later turn (requiring a standard action to activate), but it must be used within 1 hour or it is lost. You can also combine the activation of the additional spell or mystery with the immediate action required for the warp spell mystery itself, allowing you to cast the apprentice-path mystery out of turn.
Widened Eyes			KEY:Shadow Mystery ~ Widened Eyes				TYPE:Shadow Magic					SCHOOL:Divination																	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																										DURATION:10 minutes/level (D)																			SOURCEPAGE:p.153	DESC:You cover your eyes with a filter of shadow that channels and enhances incoming light. You gain low-light vision, enabling you to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, shadowy illumination, and similar conditions of poor illumination. If you already have low-light vision, these effects stack, enabling you to see four times as far as a human in poor illumination.
