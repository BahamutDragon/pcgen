SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BENEFIT:Choose a mystery you know. You cast that mystery as a supernatural ability instead of a spell-like ability, or as a spell-like ability instead of as a spell. If you choose a mystery that you cast as a supernatural ability, or if you later gain the ability to cast that mystery as a supernatural ability, you gain an extra use of that mystery per day. This feat does not otherwise increase the number of times per day that you can cast the chosen mystery. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. When you take the feat again, you can choose to affect the same mystery or a different one.
Greater Path Focus	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic																			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Path Focus																																				DESC:Choose a path of shadow magic to which you have already applied the Path Focus feat. Your mysteries of that path are now even more potent.	SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BENEFIT:You function at +1 caster level when casting mysteries of the path you select. Additionally, add +1 to the Difficulty Class of all saving throws against mysteries from that path. These bonuses stack with those granted by Path Focus.

Line Of Shadow		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic.Metashadow																	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metashadow																																			DESC:You can cast a mystery without line of sight or line of effect to the target.											SOURCEPAGE:p.136	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can apply this feat to a mystery which enables it to affect a target even if you do not currently have line of sight or line of effect. The target must still be within the spell's maximum range, and you must have had line of sight and line of effect within a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. The target gains a bonus on his save, if any, equal to the number of rounds since you had line of sight or effect. You cannot apply this feat to any mystery that requires a touch or ranged touch. Casting a mystery with Line of Shadow is a full-round action. Normal: You must have line of effect or line of sight to target a creature or object with a mystery or spell. Special: You can take this feat up to four times. To take it a second time, you must have five Metashadow feats. To take it a third time, you must have eight Metashadow feats.

To take it a third time, you must have eight Metashadow feats. To take it a fourth time, you must have eleven Metashadow feats.

SOURCEPAGE:p.137	BENEFIT:Choose one path of mysteries or school of magic to which you have access. At night, the save DC of all associated mysteries or spells increases by +1. This bonus stacks with similar bonuses, such those from the Path Focus or Spell Focus feats. The ambient light is irrelevant, nor does it matter if you can see the sky. Only the actual time of day matters. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times, but its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school or path.
Path Focus			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic																																																										DESC:Choose a path of shadow magic, such as Touch of Twilight. Your mysteries of that path are more potent than normal.					SOURCEPAGE:p.137	BENEFIT:You function at +1 caster level when casting mysteries of this path. Additionally, add +1 to the DC of all saving throws against mysteries from this path. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new path.
Quicken Mystery		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic.Metashadow																	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metashadow																																			DESC:You can cast a mystery with a moment's thought.

Reach Mystery		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic.Metashadow																	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metashadow																																			DESC:You can cast touch-range mysteries without touching the target.													SOURCEPAGE:p.137	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can cast a mystery that normally has a range of touch at any target within 30 feet. The mystery effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed on a ranged touch attack to bestow the mystery upon the recipient. Special: You can take this feat multiple times.
Shadow Cast			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic														PRECLASS:1,Shadowcaster=1																								PRESKILL:1,Concentration=5												DESC:Your shadow shimmers as you cast a spell and you seem to cast your mysteries from elsewhere.								SOURCEPAGE:p.137	BENEFIT:Designate a square adjacent to you. If no one threatens that square, you do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability.
Shadow Familiar		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic														PRECLASS:1,Shadowcaster=3																																								DESC:Noctumancers developed this feat in order to gain a mystical companion.												SOURCEPAGE:p.138	BENEFIT:You can obtain a familiar in the same manner as a sorcerer or wizard, but it possesses the dark template. As with a sorcerer or wizard, obtaining a familiar takes 24 hours and uses up magic materials worth 100 gp. For the purpose of determining familiar abilities that depend on your arcane caster level, your levels in all classes that allow you to cast mysteries or arcane spells stack. Special: If you gain access to an alternative familiar, such as through the Improved Familiar feat, it also gains the dark template.
Shadow Reflection		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic														PRECLASS:1,Shadowcaster=3																													PRESPELL:1,Dancing Shadows,Clinging Darkness				DESC:Your shadow flickers and moves in an aggressive, independent manner, enabling you to avoid some attacks of opportunity.

Shadow Vision		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic																																															PRESPELL:1,Bend Perspective,Truth Revealed	PRESTAT:1,WIS=15	DESC:Your senses grow so attuned with shadow that you gain a limited ability to see in natural and magical darkness.					SOURCEPAGE:p.138	BENEFIT:As long as you are in shadowy illumination or darkness, you can take a move action to sense the number of creatures within 20 feet that are also within shadowy illumination or darkness and the direction to each one. You cannot pinpoint the location of any creature with this feat.
Still Mystery		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic.Metashadow																																																								DESC:You can cast mysteries without gestures.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.138	BENEFIT:A stilled mystery can be cast with no somatic components. This also prevents your shadow from making gestures that differ from your own during casting. Because mysteries activated as spell-like and supernatural abilities have no somatic components, this feat is useful only with mysteries cast as arcane spells.
Unseen Arrow		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shadow Magic			PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Shadowblade ~ Unseen Weapon																																													DESC:Developed by shadowblades, this feat allows a member of that class to apply his unseen weapon abilities to thrown or projectile weapons.	SOURCEPAGE:p.138	BENEFIT:You can apply the unseen weapon class feature, and all its abilities, to a thrown or missile weapon. If you use the far shadow ability (see page 130) with a ranged weapon, it adds 30 feet to the distance the weapon can travel before you take the first range increment penalty.
