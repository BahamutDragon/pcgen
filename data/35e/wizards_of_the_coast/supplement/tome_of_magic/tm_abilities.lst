These powers, known as fundamentals, function as supernatural abilities usable three times per day. You begin play with three fundamentals and gain an additional fundamental at 4th level and every four additional levels beyond 4th. At 14th level, you can use your fundamentals an unlimited number of times per day. You can, when gaining a new level, choose a new fundamental in place of another mystery. When choosing a fundamental, you can "relearn" an already known fundamental, thus gaining another set of uses of that fundamental per day.

Mysteries and Paths											KEY:Shadowcaster ~ Mysteries and Paths				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shadowcaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.ShadowMysteries																										DEFINE:ShadowMysteryTierLVL|0			DESC:You do not cast spells as other classes do, but instead invoke mystical secrets called mysteries (see pages 139-153). You know one mystery at 1st level and gain one additional mystery every class level. Up to 6th level, you can learn only apprentice mysteries. At 7th level, you gain access to initiate mysteries, and at 13th level you become able to use master mysteries. You can choose your new mystery from any category you have access to (including fundamentals). For instance, at 8th level, you could select either a fundamental, an apprentice mystery, or an initiate mystery. Shadow magic progresses in very specific stages. You may not "jump ahead" in a path, although you need not complete a path if you do not wish to. Within a category (apprentice, initiate, master), you can only learn mysteries of a new level if you have learned at least two mysteries of a previous level, and you must know all previous mysteries within a path to select a mystery from that path. For example, you cannot learn congress of shadows (the second mystery of the Ebon Whispers path) until you know at least two 1st-level mysteries, one of which must be voice of shadow (the first mystery of that path). However, you can always select the first mystery in a path of a category you have access to, even if you didn't complete the lower category paths. For example, you could learn the shadow vision mystery, the first one (4th level) in the Initiate Veil of Shadows path, even if you know no 3rd level mysteries (all of which are in the Apprentice category). Mysteries represent thought patterns and formulae so alien that other spells seem simple in comparison. As you progress, however, your connection to the Plane of Shadow grows stronger, and your mysteries become more ingrained in your essence. When you are capable of casting only apprentice mysteries, you cast them as though they were arcane spells. They all have somatic components, armor-based spell failure chance, and are subject to interruption (but they do not require material components, foci, or verbal components). Whenever you cast a mystery as an arcane spell, observers can make a DC 15 Spot check to note that your shadow is making different gestures from the ones you make when you cast the mystery (see Detecting Mysteries, page 138). At 7th level, when you become capable of casting initiate mysteries (whether or not you choose to learn any), your apprentice mysteries become so much a part of you that they now function as spell-like abilities, and they no longer require somatic components. Your new initiate mysteries (when you learn them) function as arcane spells and follow the rules described above. When you reach 13th level and become capable of casting master mysteries, another change occurs. Your master mysteries now function as arcane spells, and your initiate mysteries function as spell-like abilities. Your apprentice mysteries become supernatural abilities. (See page 139 for rules governing supernatural abilities.) You can learn a mystery more than once. Each time you relearn a mystery, you gain another set of uses of that mystery per day. You can use each mystery you know a certain number of times per day depending on whether it is cast as a spell (once), a spell-like ability (two times), or a supernatural ability (three times). The allotments per level are given on Table 2-2, but only apply if you are able to cast mysteries of the level indicated. For example, if you choose breadth over depth and know no 4th-level mysteries as a 7th-level shadowcaster, you cannot take advantage of the one use per mystery per day detailed in the table. Unlike spellcasters, you don't get bonus mysteries for a high ability score. Although you do not prepare spells, you must rest for 8 hours and meditate for 15 minutes each day to regain your use of mysteries just as a sorcerer or bard must rest and meditate to regain use of spell slots. In order to cast a mystery, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the mystery's level. The save DC for your mysteries equals 10 + mystery level + your Cha modifier. Even though as a shadowcaster you do not "cast spells" in the traditional sense, your levels in this class count for the purpose of determining your overall caster level.

Bonus Feats													KEY:Shadowcaster ~ Bonus Feats					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shadowcaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality																												DEFINE:ShadowMysteryPathsTaken|0		DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you gain bonus feats equal to half the total number of paths you have access to, rounded down. For instance, most shadowcasters know the first mystery of two different paths at 2nd level, so they gain one bonus feat. If you learn the first mystery of a third path at 3rd level, you still have only one bonus feat, but if you learn the first mystery of yet another path at 4th level, you know four paths, and therefore gain a second bonus feat. Thus, you have a choice: fully master fewer paths and gain access to more high-level mysteries, or branch out into more paths and gain more feats but fewer high-level mysteries. You do not gain a new bonus feat for repeating a path you already know, and fundamentals do not apply for the purpose of bonus feats. You must meet the prerequisite (if any) in order to select a feat as a bonus feat. The list of feats you can select includes any metamagic feat (as described in the Player's Handbook), Favored Mystery, Greater Path Focus, Nocturnal Caster, Path Focus, Shadow Vision, and any metashadow feat.

Umbral Sight												KEY:Shadowcaster ~ Umbral Sight					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shadowcaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural																																	DESC:When you reach 3rd level, your vision extends slightly into the Plane of Shadow. You gain darkvision out to 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, or gain it from some other source, the effective distance of that vision is increased by 30 feet. At 11th level, you become able to see perfectly in complete darkness, even magical darkness, out to 60 feet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.113
Sustaining Shadow												KEY:Shadowcaster ~ Sustaining Shadow				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Shadowcaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary																																	DESC:When you reach 5th level, your bond to the Plane of Shadow allows you to absorb dark energies, mitigating certain biological needs. You need eat only a single meal per week to maintain health. At 10th level, you only need 1 hour of sleep per night (but you must still rest for 8 hours to regain your mysteries for the next day). At 15th level, you gain immunity to nonmagical diseases and poisons. Finally, at 20th level, you no longer need to breathe, and need never eat or sleep.

###Block: Prestige Classes

# Anima Mage
Soul Binding Bonus	KEY:Anima Mage ~ Soul Binding Bonus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Anima Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality					SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:At each anima mage level, your soul binding ability improves as if you had also gained a level in the binder class. Your anima mage levels and binder levels stack for the purpose of determining your bonus on binding checks, the effectiveness of your vestige-granted abilities, your ability to bind higher-level vestiges, and the number of vestiges you can bind. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a binder would have gained.		BONUS:VAR|BinderEffectiveLVL|AnimaMageLVL
Spellcasting		KEY:Anima Mage ~ Spellcasting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Anima Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality					SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:At each anima mage level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an anima mage, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Exploit Vestige		KEY:Anima Mage ~ Exploit Vestige				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Anima Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:At 2nd level, you learn how to use a bound vestige to boost your arcane spellcasting. With this ability, you can choose to forego gaining one of the vestige's granted abilities in order to gain one additional arcane spell slot per day of any level up to the highest you can cast. Thus, if you bind the vestige Dantalion (see page 28), you could give up the read thoughts ability he grants you in exchange for a bonus spell slot that day. You decide which ability to give up before you make the binding check, and you can forego only one ability per day in this manner, even if you can bind multiple vestiges. Vestiges react poorly to your use of this ability, so you take a -5 penalty on your binding check. If you make a good pact despite this penalty, you gain a bonus spell slot in exchange for the ability you gave up. If you make a poor pact (that is, you fail your binding check), you do not gain the extra spell slot, and you still give up the designated ability for the day. When you use this ability and make a good pact, you sever a portion of the bound vestige's awareness of the world that it would normally receive through you. Essentially, your binding amounts to a certain amount of trickery. The vestige being bound expects to be able to experience life through its binder, but when you make a good pact, you partially suppresses the benefit the vestige receives, making it uncomfortable and angry.
Vestigial Awareness	KEY:Anima Mage ~ Vestigial Awareness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Anima Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you can force your bound vestige to focus on alerting you to danger rather than letting it revel in the sensations that it perceives through your pact. Whenever you make a good pact with a vestige, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks for the duration of the pact.
Vestige Metamagic		KEY:Anima Mage ~ Vestige Metamagic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Anima Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			SOURCEPAGE:p.50	DESC:At 4th level, you can use a bound vestige to augment your spells by temporarily giving up access to its powers. Using vestige metamagic is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Choose one of the vestiges to which you are bound whenever you activate this ability. You can then apply the effects of any metamagic feat that you possess to a spell you cast that round, without increasing its spell level. However, you lose access to all the abilities and powers granted by the chosen vestige upon activation and do not regain them for 5 rounds. You cannot use this ability if you do not have a vestige bound, or if you do not currently have access to its abilities (through the use of this ability, an antimagic field, or some other effect). Vestige metamagic is usable once per day at 5th level, two times per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 9th level.
Vestige Casting		KEY:Anima Mage ~ Vestige Casting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Anima Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural			SOURCEPAGE:p.51	DESC:At 10th level, you can use a bound vestige's power to cast a spell outside the normal limits of time and magic. Once per day, you can cast any spell that you currently have prepared (or use an available spell slot if you cast spells spontaneously) as an immediate action. You cast the spell as if it were modified by the Silent Spell and Still Spell metamagic feats, whether or not you have those feats.

# Knight of the Sacred Seal

Soul Binding			KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Soul Binding				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:At each knight of the sacred seal level, your soul binding ability improves as if you had also gained a level in the binder class. Thus, your knight of the sacred seal levels and binder levels stack for the purpose of determining your bonus on binding checks, the effectiveness of your vestigegranted abilities, your ability to bind higher-level vestiges, and the number of vestiges you can bind. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a binder would have gained.
Aligned Strike			KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Aligned Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:Your natural weapons as well as any weapons you wield are treated as aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment of your weapons matches your own to as great a degree as possible. Thus, if you're lawful good, your weapons strike as both lawful-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, but if you're neutral good, they strike only as good-aligned. If you are neutral, your weapon strikes as one alignment component of your choice: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You must make this choice upon entering the prestige class and cannot thereafter change it.
Patron Vestige			KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Patron Vestige				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:When you become a knight of the sacred seal, you select any one vestige that you have previously bound as your patron. You develop a stronger than normal relationship with this vestige that grants you several benefits as you advance in this prestige class. If you expel your patron vestige by means of the Expel Vestige feat or do not renew your pact with it on any given day, you lose access to all supernatural class features gained from this prestige class until such time as you contact that vestige again. You can bind other vestiges in the interim, as normal for the binder class, but you gain no additional benefits from those pacts. You are never at risk of making a poor pact with your patron vestige.
Vestige's Protection		KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Vestige's Protection			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:When you attain 2nd level, your relationship with your patron vestige deepens, prompting it to take steps to ensure your protection. As a swift action, you can acquire an insight bonus to your Armor Class equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1). The same bonus also applies on your Reflex saves. Both of these benefits last for 1 round. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.
Vestige's Protection Aura	KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Vestige's Protection Aura		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:When you attain 3rd level, your patron vestige extends its protection to all creatures adjacent to you whom you designate as friends. Whenever you activate your vestige's protection class feature, those benefits apply to all designated allies adjacent to you.
Vestige's Power			KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Vestige's Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:At 4th level, you can draw upon the power of your patron vestige to augment your fighting abilities as a swift action. You gain a +2 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Constitution, a +10-foot bonus to your base land speed, and a +4 bonus on Will saves for 1 round. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.
Apotheosis				KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Apotheosis				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:At 5th level, your type changes to outsider, and you gain the native subtype (see the perfect self monk class feature on page 42 of the Player's Handbook). You also gain damage reduction 10/magic.
Vestige's Surge			KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Vestige's Surge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:At 5th level, once per day, when you activate one of your patron vestige's powers, or your vestige's protection or vestige's power class feature, you can choose to activate that ability again immediately rather than waiting the usual 5 rounds.
Multiclass Note			KEY:Knight of the Sacred Seal ~ Multiclass Note				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Knight of the Sacred Seal Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:A paladin who becomes a knight of the sacred seal can continue advancing as a paladin.

# Scion of Dantalion
Soul Binding			KEY:Scion of Dantalion ~ Soul Binding			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scion of Dantalion Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:At each scion of Dantalion level, your soul binding ability improves as if you had also gained a level in the binder class. Thus, your scion of Dantalion levels and binder levels stack for the purpose of determining your bonus on binding checks, the effectiveness of your vestige-granted abilities, your ability to bind higher-level vestiges, and the number of vestiges you can bind. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a binder would have gained.
Favored of Dantalion		KEY:Scion of Dantalion ~ Favored of Dantalion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scion of Dantalion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:You need never worry about succumbing to Dantalion's influence because you automatically succeed on the binding check when making a pact with him. You can hide or show Dantalion's sign as desired, as though you possessed the suppress sign class feature (see page 11). With each new level you take in the scion of Dantalion prestige class, Dantalion's seal (see page 28) includes another face. Thus, the sign appears as two vestigial faces on your torso at 1st level and as six faces at 5th level. When you activate an ability granted by Dantalion or by the scion of Dantalion prestige class, the eyes and mouths of the faces briefly open to reveal distant stars set in darkness.
Scholarship of Dantalion	KEY:Scion of Dantalion ~ Scholarship of Dantalion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scion of Dantalion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:Your connection to Dantalion gives you occasional flashes of insight into a variety of topics. Once per day per scion of Dantalion level, you can reroll any Knowledge check you just made. You must abide by the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll.
Improved Read Thoughts		KEY:Scion of Dantalion ~ Improved Read Thoughts		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scion of Dantalion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:At 2nd level, whenever you use the read thoughts ability granted by Dantalion, you gain full knowledge of the target's surface thoughts on the first round of concentration, assuming that it fails its Will save. Normally, you know its surface thoughts only after 3 rounds of concentration. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.
Swift Awe of Dantalion		KEY:Scion of Dantalion ~ Swift Awe of Dantalion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scion of Dantalion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can activate your awe of Dantalion ability as a swift action instead of a move action whenever you are bound to that vestige. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.
Overwhelming Thoughts		KEY:Scion of Dantalion ~ Overwhelming Thoughts		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scion of Dantalion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you can choose to overwhelm the thoughts of any creature you target with the read thoughts ability granted by Dantalion. As a standard action, you send your thoughts out to a single creature whose thoughts you are reading (so it has already failed its Will save against your read thoughts ability), forcing it to succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your effective binder level + your Cha modifier) or be dazed for 1d4 rounds. During this time, you can maintain concentration on your read thoughts ability and, as a move action, continue to read the thoughts of a creature you have dazed on subsequent rounds. A successful save allows the creature to break free of your thought reading.
Dantalion's Glare			KEY:Scion of Dantalion ~ Dantalion's Glare		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scion of Dantalion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:From 4th level on, you can use a standard action to intensify Dantalion's sign and glare through its eyes. The starry voids in the eyes of Dantalion's sign blaze forth with the brightness of an exploding star, affecting all creatures in a 30-foot cone. Every creature within this area must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your effective binder level + your Cha modifier) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. You must be showing at least one face of Dantalion's sign to use this ability. If the face is hidden beneath clothing, you can reveal it as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, so long as you have a hand free. If the face is hidden beneath armor, you must have a free hand and use a standard action to reveal the sign. Doing so provokes attacks of opportunity, and you take a -2 penalty to AC while revealing the sign in this manner.

# Tenebrous Apostate

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

Soul Binding		KEY:Tenebrous Apostate ~ Soul Binding			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tenebrous Apostate Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At each Tenebrous apostate level beyond 1st, your soul binding ability improves as if you had also gained a level in the binder class.

You can use a turn attempt to deal 1d6 points of damage per effective turning level you possess to every undead creature within 30 feet. Each affected undead can attempt a Will save (DC 10 + your effective turning level + your Cha modifier) for half damage. If you use a rebuke attempt, each undead within 30 feet is instead cured of 1d6 points of damage per effective turning level. This effect occurs instead of the normal result of a turn or rebuke attempt. You can still use these turn attempts in conjunction with divine feats, as normal.

If you accidentally smite a creature that is not either possessed or bound to a vestige, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.
Mettle			KEY:Witch Slayer ~ Mettle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Witch Slayer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can shrug off magical effects that could harm you.

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, such as bonus feats for mystery paths known, or improved familiar for wizard or sorcerer. If you had more than one casting class before becoming a child of night, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining mysteries or spells per day, caster level, and mysteries or spells known.

At 10th level, two times per day as a swift action, you can make your true location more difficult to discern, as if you were affected by the displacement spell, for 10 rounds.	BONUS:SKILL|Hide|ChildofNightLVL
Cold Resistance		KEY:Child of Night ~ Cold Resistance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Child of Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.118	DESC:At 1st level, the shadow in your essence provides cold resistance 5.

Sustaining Shadow		KEY:Child of Night ~ Sustaining Shadow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Child of Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.118	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you lose various biological needs, as you draw power from the Plane of Shadow. This functions as the shadowcaster ability described on page 113, except new abilities are gained at 4th, 6th, and 8th level. If you have the sustaining shadow ability from a different class (shadowcaster, for example), you automatically gain the next sustaining shadow ability.
Dancing Shadows		KEY:Child of Night ~ Dancing Shadows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Child of Night Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.118	DESC:At 3rd level, you can use the dancing shadows mystery as a supernatural ability once per day with a caster level equal to your class level plus your levels in any other mystery-casting class.

Master's Bidding		KEY:Master of Shadow ~ Master's Bidding			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shadow Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.121	DESC:At 1st level, as a standard action, you can focus your affinity with shadow to enhance your shadow servant, granting it one special ability for 1 round. The special abilities available to your shadow servant are described in the Shadow Servant sidebar, and depend on your class level. For example, at 4th level you could give your servant any of the following special abilities: interact with corporeal, fast healing 1, extra attack, or cold damage +1d8. At 5th level, you can grant your shadow servant a special ability for 1 round by taking only a move action rather than a standard action. You can choose to use two move actions in the same turn to grant it two abilities. Additional move actions granted by spells, class features, or the like can also be used to further enhance your shadow servant. At 10th level, you can grant your shadow servant a special ability for 1 round by taking only a swift action rather than a move action. You can still use move actions to give it additional abilities. Thus, a 10th-level master of shadow who does nothing else in a round can choose to give his shadow servant three special abilities (using one swift action and two move actions).

Mysteries/Spellcasting	KEY:Noctumancer ~ Mysteries/Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Noctumancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:At each level, you gain new mysteries or spells per day and an increase in caster level (and mysteries or spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in both your mystery-using class and your arcane spellcasting class. You do not, however, gain any other benefits a character of these classes would have gained. If you had more than one mystery-using or arcane spellcasting class before becoming a noctumancer, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Capture Magic's Shadow	KEY:Noctumancer ~ Capture Magic's Shadow		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Noctumancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:At 1st level, when you successfully dispel a mystery or spell (such as with the mysteries shadows fade or unravel dweomer, or the spells dispel magic or break enchantment), you can absorb its energy. You add one-half the level (round down, minimum 1) of the mystery or spell you dispelled to the caster level of any mystery or spell you cast in the next round. For instance, if you dispel a 4th-level spell, you add +2 to the caster level of the spell you cast in the next round. You cannot draw power from dispelling your own mysteries or spells.
Innate Counterspell	KEY:Noctumancer ~ Innate Counterspell		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Noctumancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can attempt to counter a mystery or spell without using a readied action. Once per day, you can counter a spell as an immediate action, by expending a mystery use per day, a spell slot (if you prepare spells), or a spell use (if you are a spontaneous caster) as long as the mystery or spell expended is of the same level or higher as the mystery or spell to be countered. At 7th level, when you successfully counter a mystery or spell using this ability, you retain some of the magical essence of the countered dweomer. You can choose to either gain one additional use of a mystery, regain an expended spell slot (if you prepare spells), or gain the use of an additional spell (if you are a spontaneous caster). The level of the mystery or spell you gain is equal to one-half the level of the mystery or spell you countered (rounded down, minimum 1). You can use innate counterspell once per day at 2nd level, two times at 5th, and three times at 8th.
Eldritch Disruption	KEY:Noctumancer ~ Eldritch Disruption		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Noctumancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.126	DESC:At 6th level, you can use a standard action to disrupt the magical energies of a single target within 60 feet. That target must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + your noctumancer level + your Cha modifier) or take a -4 penalty to its caster level for any mysteries or spells it casts for 1 minute. You can use eldritch disruption three times per day.
Eldritch Vortex		KEY:Noctumancer ~ Eldritch Vortex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Noctumancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.126	DESC:At 10th level, you can emit mystic energies in a 20-foot-radius burst around yourself. Any creature other than you within that area takes a -4 penalty to caster level for any mysteries, spells, or spell-like abilities it casts or uses. The vortex lasts 1 minute and can be used once per day.
Shadow's Persistence	KEY:Noctumancer ~ Shadow's Persistence		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Noctumancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.126	DESC:At 10th level, you gain temporary immunity to any mystery or spell captured or countered by means of your capture magic's shadow or innate counterspell ability. For 1 minute, you cannot be affected by any casting of that mystery or spell.

# Shadowblade
Unseen Weapon		KEY:Shadowblade ~ Unseen Weapon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:As a standard action, you can wrap any melee weapon you wield in a layer of shifting shadows. This causes the weapon to darken, become less distinct, and leave a trail of shadow behind it as it moves. Your weapon must be in hand and ready to use for you to draw upon this power. You can dismiss the effect with a free action; dropping or sheathing the weapon also ends the effect. Once per day per shadowblade level, you can activate one of the powers of your unseen weapon as a swift action. At 1st level, you have the power to make an unerring strike (see below). As you gain levels in the class, you acquire additional choices when activating your unseen weapon, as indicated on Table 2-6. When you activate your unseen weapon, choose one of the available abilities. Multiple uses of the same ability do not stack on a single attack.
Shadow and Stealth	KEY:Shadowblade ~ Shadow and Stealth		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.130	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, the shadows that engulf your unseen weapon cover you as well, granting you a circumstance bonus equal to half your class level (round down) on Hide and Move Silently checks.
Sudden Strike		KEY:Shadowblade ~ Sudden Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.130	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, if you can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever your target is denied a dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with your attack. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every two levels thereafter. You can't use sudden strike when fl anking an opponent unless that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. Ranged attacks can count as sudden strike attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. Sudden strike functions identically to sneak attack in all other respects. The extra damage from sudden strike stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target. It also stacks with the ephemeral weapon ability of the unseen weapon class feature.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Sudden Strike
Shadow Vision		KEY:Shadowblade ~ Shadow Vision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.130	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you are able to see clearly in shadowy illumination. Thus, you can see up to 40 feet clearly in the illumination provided by a torch (which gives off bright illumination in a 20-foot radius and shadowy illumination for 40 feet beyond that), or twice that if you have low-light vision.
See in Darkness		KEY:Shadowblade ~ See in Darkness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.130	DESC:At 7th level, you can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell.
# Unseen Weapon
Unerring Strike		KEY:Unseen Weapon ~ Unerring Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your next melee attack ignores any miss chance because of concealment or total concealment. You gain this choice at 1st level.
Unexpected Strike		KEY:Unseen Weapon ~ Unexpected Strike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus against your next melee attack. You gain this ability at 3rd level.
Ephemeral Weapon		KEY:Unseen Weapon ~ Ephemeral Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your next melee attack deals an extra 2d6 points of damage, as extraplanar darkness momentarily replaces portions of your opponent's body. You gain this choice at 5th level.
Shadowy Strike		KEY:Unseen Weapon ~ Shadowy Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your next melee attack is resolved as a melee touch attack, ignoring armor and natural armor. You gain this ability at 7th level.
Far Shadow			KEY:Unseen Weapon ~ Far Shadow			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	DESC:Your melee reach is increased by 10 feet for 1 round. You gain this choice at 9th level. At 10th level, you can use your unseen weapon abilities as a free action, though you are still limited to one use per day per class level.

# Shadowsmith
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Shadowsmith ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowsmith Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:You are proficient with simple and martial weapons, with light armor, and with shields (except tower shields).


Mysteries Known			KEY:Shadowsmith ~ Mysteries Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowsmith Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:You have the ability to cast a small number of mysteries. To cast a mystery, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the mystery level, so if you have an Intelligence of 10 or lower, you cannot cast mysteries. High ability scores do not provide bonus mysteries. Saving throws against your mysteries have a DC of 10 + mystery level + your Int modifier. Your selection of mysteries is extremely limited. You begin in this class knowing only a single 1st-level mystery. Every four levels thereafter (at 5th and 9th), you gain an additional mystery known. As with the shadowcaster class, you may not skip ahead in a given path. Your mysteries must all be drawn from an apprentice path, and you cast them all as arcane spells. You can use each mystery you know once per day. You do not gain fundamentals.

Touch of Shadow			KEY:Shadowsmith ~ Touch of Shadow				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowsmith Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:At 1st level, your ability to manipulate shadow is undeveloped. You cannot yet create actual items, but you can surround your hands and feet in a layer of shadow. This ability grants you a bonus on Climb checks equal to your class level. Further, it distributes your weight more evenly, so you cannot be tracked. Touch of shadow lasts for 1 minute per class level and is usable a number of times per day equal to your class level.
Shroud of Shadow			KEY:Shadowsmith ~ Shroud of Shadow				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowsmith Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can surround your body in a thin layer of shadow. You gain a bonus on Hide checks and Move Silently checks equal to your class level. Shroud of shadow lasts for 1 minute per class level and is usable a number of times per day equal to your class level.
Shadow Craft			KEY:Shadowsmith ~ Shadow Craft				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowsmith Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:As of 3rd level, you can create small items, such as tools or weapons, from shadow. You need merely place your hands into any shadow and draw forth the desired item. It cannot possess moving or fl exible parts, so you could not create a crossbow, a rope, a fl ail, or a cabinet. You can create nearly any other weapon, simple tool, or small item, however. You can create one item weighing a number of pounds up to twice your class level, or two items whose combined weight does not exceed that limit. Using shadow craft is a standard action. If the item leaves your possession, it fades away in 1d4 rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for 1 hour per class level. Shadow craft is usable a number of times per day equal to one-half your class level. Items created by shadow craft cannot be employed as material components or foci in spellcasting. If you want to create an item that mimics a specific item you have seen, you must succeed on a DC 20 Craft check of the appropriate sort (weaponsmithing, for instance). At 6th level, you can enhance your creations. You can imbue a shadow-crafted weapon or shield with an enhancement bonus equal to your class level minus 5. For instance, if you are an 8th-level shadowsmith, you can create a +3 battle axe. If you create two enhanced items at one time (which becomes possible when you attain 7th level), you must divide the total enhancement bonus between those items. (For instance, at 8th level, you could create a +1 battleaxe and a +2 large shield.) To succeed at this enhanced crafting, you must make an appropriate Craft check for each item (usually weaponsmithing or armorsmithing) against a DC of 20 + the desired enhancement bonus. If you fail, the item is nonmagical. You can only have one enhanced shadow-crafted item (or two, if they were created in the same round) at a time. If you create new enhanced items, the old ones immediately become nonmagical. Attempting to create an enhanced item (or two, if so desired) with shadow craft is a full-round action. At 8th level, you can use shadow craft to create light armor for yourself (which you can give an enhancement bonus to). The armor you craft automatically has the improved shadow special ability (DMG 219). At 9th level, you can quicken your shadow crafting. You need only a standard action to create enhanced items and only a swift action to create nonmagical ones. At 10th level, you can apply the shadow striking ability (see page 155) to any magic weapon you create through shadow craft. (If you create two weapons at once, only one can be shadow striking.) Further, you do not need to craft the item on the Plane of Shadow as is normally the case with shadow striking weapons.
Armor of Shadow			KEY:Shadowsmith ~ Armor of Shadow				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowsmith Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:Starting at 4th level, you can take a standard action to surround yourself in hardened shadow. This ability grants you a +2 defl ection bonus to AC. Armor of shadow lasts for 10 minutes per class level, and is usable a number of times per day equal to one-half your class level. At 7th level, the defl ection bonus increases to +4. At 10th level, you quicken your armor of shadow, activating it as a swift action.
Widen Shroud			KEY:Shadowsmith ~ Widen Shroud				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Shadowsmith Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.133	DESC:Starting at 5th level, you can widen your touch of shadow ability to include a number of companions equal to one-half your class level. If they move more than 10 feet from you, the effect ends for them; coming closer to you again does not restore it. Widen shroud lasts for 1 minute per class level; each use counts as a daily use of your touch of shadow ability.


###Block - Truenamer	
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Truenamer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:You are proficient with simple weapons and with light armor, but not with shields.	ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=WeaponProfSimple|TYPE=ArmorProfLight
Known Personal Truename		KEY:Truenamer ~ Known Personal Truename						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:You know your own personal truename. You cannot pronounce it automatically; doing so requires a Truespeak check with a DC equal to 15 + (2 x your Hit Dice) + 2. Because it's your personal truename, you get a +4 bonus on the Truespeak check.
Utterances				KEY:Truenamer ~ Utterances								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:You have the ability to speak utterances, powerful combinations of truenames that can alter the world around you in fundamental ways. Utterances exist in three lexicons: The Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, the Lexicon of the Crafted Tool, and the Lexicon of the Perfected Map. You begin play knowing one utterance from the 1st level of the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, and you gain one utterance from this lexicon at each truenamer level you attain. You gain access to higher levels of utterances at the levels indicated on Table 3-3. When you gain access to higher-level utterances, you can choose an utterance from that level or from a lower level, if you wish. Each utterance represents hundreds of truenames in your repertoire. When you gain the word of bolstering, for example, you say thanthan'ku'ul-hrasechni when you're delivering it on your elf ranger ally and yanu-shankrini'qalaasha when you're delivering it on your gnome rogue friend. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your utterances is 10 + 1/2 your truenamer level + your Cha modifier. Beginning at 4th level, you also gain access to the 1st-level utterances of the Lexicon of the Crafted Tool, allowing you to alter objects with your truenames. You gain access to higher-level utterances from this lexicon at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, as indicated on Table 3-3. Beginning at 8th level, you gain access to the 1st-level utterances of the Lexicon of the Perfected Map, allowing you to alter places with your truenames. You gain access to higher-level utterances from this lexicon at 12th, 16th, and 20th levels, as indicated on Table 3-3. See page 232 for the rules on successfully speaking utterances.
Knowledge Focus			KEY:Truenamer ~ Knowledge Focus							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:[Requires implementation] As a truenamer, you spend a great deal of time studying the world around you in an effort to learn new truenames. At the levels indicated on Table 3-2, you gain a permanent +3 bonus on a Knowledge skill of your choice. Each time you gain this ability, you can apply it to a different Knowledge skill, or to the same Knowledge skill, if you want to focus on a particular area of expertise.
Truename Research			KEY:Truenamer ~ Truename Research							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:[Requires implementation] At 6th level, you gain Truename Research as a bonus feat. See page 229 for details. Bonus Recitation Feat: By repeating your own personal truename over and over with a particular infl ection, you can achieve various healing effects starting at 8th level. Choose one recitation feat from those given later in the chapter. You must still meet the prerequisites for the bonus feat to take it. At 15th level, you gain a second bonus recitation feat.
See the Named			KEY:Truenamer ~ See the Named								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:Beginning at 9th level, you have the ability to see a creature from afar whose personal truename you know. This ability works as the scrying spell, but does not require a mirror or pool of water to function. Instead, you must make a Truespeak check for the creature as normal (see page 196 for information on making a Truespeak check to affect a creature). If your check is successful, the creature does not get a save to resist the ability, but you can view the subject for only 1 round. You can use this ability once per day.
Sending				KEY:Truenamer ~ Sending									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:Beginning at 13th level, you can speak to creatures whose personal truenames you know from a great distance. You must make a successful Truespeak check (DC 15 + 2 x target's CR) to use this ability. If successful, you can send a message to the subject as a sending spell (caster level equal to your truenamer level). You can use this ability three times per day.
Speak unto the Masses		KEY:Truenamer ~ Speak unto the Masses						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.200	DESC:At 17th level, you have the ability to affect a number of creatures of the same creature type with a single, powerful utterance. You can only affect creatures of the same type (humanoids, giants, or dragons, for example) with a single use of this ability, although you could use it against a different group of a different creature type each round. No two of the creatures you wish to affect with your utterance can be more than 30 feet apart, and the base DC for your Truespeak check is equal to the most powerful (highest CR or most Hit Dice, if you are affecting PCs) creature in the group. For each creature you wish to affect with the utterance beyond the first, the DC of your Truespeak check increases by 2. The Law of Resistance (see page 233) applies to utterances altered with speak unto the masses. As a result, additional uses of an utterance modified with speak unto the masses might be more difficult, even if you then want to use the utterance on a single creature later in the day. For example, if you attempted to use an utterance against four fire giants (each CR 10), the DC would be 15 + (2 x 10) + 6, or 41. If your attempt was successful, and you later tried to use that same utterance against a single marut (CR 15), the Law of Resistance applies, and the DC would be 15 + (2 x 15) + 2, or 47.
Say My Name and I Am There	KEY:Truenamer ~ Say My Name and I Am There					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Truenamer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.201	DESC:At 20th level, you develop a truename-not your personal truename, but a sort of true nickname-that is invested with cosmic power such that others who speak it can conjure you forth. Whenever someone successfully says this truename, you can appear at that creature's location as if taken there by a word of recall spell. You know who is saying your truename, and you can choose not to be transported if you wish. The nickname is often one or two syllables taken from your personal truename. A creature speaking your true nickname need not make a Truespeak check to do so. Most truenamers with this ability teach the truename to their friends and allies so they can be called when needed.
