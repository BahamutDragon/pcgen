Claw Bracer												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Claw Bracer																TYPE:Bracer.Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Piercing		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:30	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																									SPROP:A claw bracer is a metal armband with three steel claws projecting from the top, extending about 4 inches beyond the tip of the wearer's extended fingers. The wearer can cast spells normally while wearing the bracer and cannot be disarmed. Many claw bracers are enhanced as magic weapons.
Panther Claw											PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Panther Claw																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Piercing.Slashing	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:75	WT:3										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																									SPROP:The panther claw looks much like a punch dagger with two extra blades. The weapon retains the punch dagger's deadly force, and the extra blades are useful for disarming opponents. Wielders proficient with the panther claw gain a +4 circumstance bonus when making disarm attempts with it.
Stump Knife												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Stump Knife																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Piercing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:8	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:A stump knife is akin to a punching dagger, except that it can be securely attached to the stump of a missing forelimb. For someone proficient in its use, the stump knife becomes an extension of his body. Against foes to whom you have dealt damage during a continuous melee, the stump knife's threat range is doubled (17-20). Your opponent cannot disarm you of a stump knife.
Tiger Claws												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tiger Claws																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Piercing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:5	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:Also known as "bagh nakh," this is a strap or glove fitted with spikes in the palm and wielded like brass knuckles. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of tiger claws. An attack with tiger claws is considered an armed attack. A monk using tiger claws can strike with her unarmed base attack bonus, including her more favorable number of attacks per round, along with other applicable modifiers. The cost and weight are for a single tiger claw.
Tiger Claws (Nekode)										PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tiger Claws																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Piercing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:5	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:A slightly different version of the Tiger Claws, the nekode, is both a weapon and a climbing tool. Using a pair of nekodes while climbing grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. This bonus does not stack with the +2 bonus from using a climber's kit, because they're essentially the same circumstance.
Triple Dagger											PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Triple Dagger																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Piercing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:10	WT:1										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:This weapon is used in the off hand as a means to disarm an opponent—you hold it as you would a shield, not another weapon, and so do not take penalties for fighting with two weapons. When using a triple dagger, you get a +3 circumstance bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if you fail to disarm your opponent). The triple dagger could also be used as a normal dagger, if desired, but if used in the off hand, all normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.
Ward Cestus												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Ward Cestus																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Bludgeoning.Unarmed	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:10	WT:4										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:This is a stout leather gauntlet with a well-forged metal weight sewn into it over the knuckles. A strike with a ward cestus is considered an unarmed attack. If you take a Total Defense action, you gain an additional +1 bonus to your Armor Class, representing blows you block with the back of your protected hand. Your opponent cannot disarm you of a ward cestus. The cost and weight are for a single ward cestus.
#Small
Gnome Battlepick				KEY:Battlepick (Gnome)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Battlepick (Gnome)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.OneHanded.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:10	WT:5										CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:S	SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:A gnome battlepick is crafted and weighted to be used by creatures of Small size. A Small character can use a gnome battlepick twohanded as a martial weapon.
Bladed Gauntlet				KEY:Gauntlet (Bladed)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Gauntlet (Bladed)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Slashing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:30	WT:4										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:Unlike with a standard gauntlet, an attack with a bladed gauntlet is not considered an unarmed attack. The bladed gauntlet has two blades that extend from the back of the wrist following the line of the forearm. The cost and weight are for a single gauntlet.
Sai (AE)					KEY:Sai ~ Arms and Equipment			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sai ~ Arms and Equipment														TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Piercing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:1	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																									SPROP:A sai's pronglike extrusions are designed to help catch and disarm opponents' weapons. If you attempt to disarm your opponent using a sai, you gain a +4 bonus on the opposed attack roll. (You don't gain any bonus if someone tries to disarm you of your sai.)  A monk using a sai can strike with her unarmed base attack bonus, including her more favorable attacks per round, along with other applicable modifiers.
Sapara												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sapara																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Slashing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:15	WT:6										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																									SPROP:This ancient sword is a smaller version of the khopesh. You can use a sapara to make trip attacks with its hooklike blade. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the sapara to avoid being tripped.
Butterfly Sword				KEY:Sword (Butterfly)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sword (Butterfly)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Slashing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:10	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:A monk using a butterfly sword fights with her unarmed base attack bonus, including her more favorable number of attacks per round, along with other applicable modifiers.
Tonfa													PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Tonfa																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Bludgeoning		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:0.2	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:WOOD					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:A monk using a tonfa can strike with her unarmed base attack bonus, including her more favorable number of attacks per round, along with other applicable modifiers.
War Fan												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|War Fan																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Light.Finesseable.Slashing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:30	WT:3										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:This weapon appears to the untrained eye as nothing more than a beautifully crafted lady's fan. In fact, the vanes of the fan are crafted from steel, and the tips are needle-sharp. When first entering melee using a war fan, you may attempt a Bluff check against an opponent's Sense Motive check. If you win the contest, you gain a +4 bonus on attacks made against that foe during the first round of combat.
#Medium-Size
Chain-and-Dagger											PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Chain-and-Dagger																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.OneHanded.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:4	WT:4										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																									SPROP:When wielding the chain-anddagger, you gain a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed yourself, if you fail to disarm your foe). You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks, gaining a +2 bonus on your trip attempt. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can opt to drop the chain-and-dagger instead of being tripped.
Khopesh												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Khopesh																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.OneHanded.Slashing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:20	WT:12										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:You can use a khopesh to make trip attacks with its hooklike blade. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the khopesh to avoid being tripped.
Mercurial Longsword			KEY:Longsword (Mercurial)			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Longsword (Mercurial)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.OneHanded.Slashing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:400	WT:16										CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:As the mercurial greatsword, except that in nonproficient hands, the shifting mass and feel of the blade penalizes the wielder by an additional -2 penalty on attack rolls, beyond the normal -4 nonproficiency penalty for using an exotic weapon untrained.
#Large
Duom													PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Duom																		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.TwoHanded.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:20	WT:8										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.7																									SPROP:The duom is a longspear with a standard spearhead, as well as two blades curved so that they point backward along the shaft. The weapon has reach, allowing you to strike opponents 10 feet away with it. Those proficient with the duom can also attack adjacent foes with the reversed heads using a practiced "reverse thrust." Apply a -2 penalty on the attack roll if you use the duom to attack a second, adjacent opponent in the same round you attacked the first opponent.
Mercurial Greatsword			KEY:Greatsword (Mercurial)			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Greatsword (Mercurial)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.TwoHanded.Slashing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:600	WT:17										CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:2d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:This huge blade hides a secret reservoir of quicksilver (also called mercury by alchemists) that runs along the interior of the blade in a slender channel. When the blade is vertical, the mercury swiftly fills an interior bulb in the haft, but when swung, the heavy liquid flows out into the blade, making it heavier. In nonproficient hands, this shifting mass penalizes the wielder by an additional -3 penalty on attack rolls, beyond the normal -4 nonproficiency penalty for using an exotic weapon untrained.
Gyrspike												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Gyrspike																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning.Slashing.Double	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:90	WT:20										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	ALTCRITMULT:x2	ALTCRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d8	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:STEEL		ALTEQMOD:STEEL	WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:A gyrspike is a double weapon. A stout shaft holds a flail on one end and a longsword on the other. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties for two-weapon fighting, as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You get a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an enemy when you wield a gyrspike (including the opposed attack roll to avoid being disarmed yourself if you fail to disarm your enemy). You can also use this weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the gyrspike to avoid being tripped.
Double Mace					KEY:Mace (Double)					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mace (Double)																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning.Double			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:125	WT:25										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	ALTCRITMULT:x2	ALTCRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8	ALTDAMAGE:1d8	EQMOD:STEEL		ALTEQMOD:STEEL	WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:A stout shaft with a spiked, cylindrical head at each end, this is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons as if you are using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see Attacking with Two Weapons in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can't use it as a double weapon.
Manti													PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Manti																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.TwoHanded.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:15	WT:9										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:A manti is a shortspear with four additional spear heads that project vertically from the shaft, creating a star pattern of five blade heads instead of just a single forward-pointing blade. The advantage of the unusual blade arrangement is that you can make one additional attack of opportunity during the round.
Double Scimitar				KEY:Scimitar (Double)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Scimitar (Double)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.TwoHanded.Slashing.Double			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:125	WT:15										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3	ALTCRITMULT:x2	ALTCRITRANGE:3	DAMAGE:1d6	ALTDAMAGE:1d6	EQMOD:STEEL		ALTEQMOD:STEEL	WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																									SPROP:The curved blades of the double scimitar are used most effectively when spinning and twirling with the weapon. Despite its size, the weapon benefits more from quick, precise movement than from brute force. The double scimitar is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons as if you are using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see Attacking with Two Weapons in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). A creature using a double weapon in one hand can't use it as a double weapon.
Three-Section Staff										PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Three-Section Staff															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:4	WT:8										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:WOOD					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:Originally a farm implement for threshing grain, this weapon is composed of three sections of wood of equal length, joined at the ends by chain, leather, or rope.  A monk using a three-section staff (for which she must take an Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat) fights with her unarmed base attack bonus and her more favorable number of attacks per round, along with other applicable attack modifiers. The three-section staff requires two hands to use.
#Huge
Fullblade												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Fullblade																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.OneHanded.Large.Slashing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:100	WT:23										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:2d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:L	SOURCEPAGE:p.7																									SPROP:A fullblade is 18 inches longer than a greatsword and is too large for a Medium-size creature to use with two hands without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. (Medium-size creatures cannot use a fullblade one-handed at all.)  A Large creature could use the fullblade with one hand, but it would be assessed the standard -4 nonproficiency penalty on its attack rolls; Large creatures can use the fullblade in two hands as a martial weapon. A Large creature with the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (fullblade) feat can use the fullblade in one hand, but a Medium-size creature must use both hands even if it has the relevant feat. A fullblade is also called an ogre's greatsword.

##Exotic Weapons-ranged
#Tiny
Fukimi-bari (Mouth Darts)									PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Fukimi-bari																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Dart.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:1	WT:0.1									CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light									RANGE:5	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.7																									SPROP:These slim, almost needle-like metal darts are concealed in the mouth, then spit at the target. Their effective range is extremely short, and they deal little damage, but they are highly useful when taking an opponent by surprise. You can fire up to three fukimi-bari per attack (all at the same target). Do not apply your Strength modifier to damage with fukimi-bari. They are too small to carry the extra force that a strong character usually imparts to a thrown weapon. The cost and weight are for a single fukimi-bari.
Halfling Skiprock				KEY:Skiprock (Halfling)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Skiprock (Halfling)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Ammunition.Bludgeoning		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:3	WT:0.25									CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d2										WIELD:Light									RANGE:10	SIZE:S	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																									SPROP:These polished, perfectly weighted stones are prized by halflings, for if thrown well enough, they ricochet off one target to strike a second. If the skiprock hits its target, it ricochets toward another target of the thrower's choice adjacent to the original target (within 5 feet). The thrower immediately makes a second attack roll for the skiprock against the new target, with an attack bonus equal to the first roll -2. Skiprocks could be used as sling bullets, but using a skiprock's ricochet ability in conjunction with a sling requires taking the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat specifically for that purpose.
#Small
Two-ball Bolas				KEY:Bolas (Two-ball)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Bolas (Two-ball)																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Bludgeoning				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:5	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:WOOD					WIELD:Light									RANGE:10	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:A set of two-ball bolas consists of two heavy wooden spheres connected by lengths of cord. It is a ranged weapon used to trip an opponent. When you throw a set of bolas, you make a ranged touch attack against your opponent. If you hit, your opponent must succeed on a Dexterity or Strength check opposed by your Strength check or be tripped.Bolas can only trip Medium-size or smaller targets. Your opponent cannot trip you when you make a trip attack with a set of two-ball bolas.
Gnome Calculus				KEY:Calculus (Gnome)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Calculus (Gnome)																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Projectile					CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:15	WT:2																									EQMOD:LEATHER				WIELD:Light									RANGE:50	SIZE:S	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																									SPROP:This oversized sling is made to fire flasks filled with liquid. Common ammunition includes acid, alchemist's fire, and other alchemical substances. Alchemical ammunition deals damage according to its properties, but it gains the range increment of the gnome calculus.
Chakram												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Chakram																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Slashing					CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:50	WT:2										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light									RANGE:30	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																									SPROP:The chakram is a throwing disk or quoit about 1 foot in diameter, with a sharpened outer rim.
Throwing Iron											PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Throwing Iron																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Slashing					CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:8	WT:3										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light									RANGE:10	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:These weapons have complex blades with two or more edged or pointed protrusions. Unlike most hurled weapons, throwing irons are as often thrown along a horizontal plane as along a vertical one.
Whip-dagger												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Whip																		TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Melee.Finesseable.Reach.Slashing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:25	WT:3										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light									RANGE:15	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.10																									SPROP:A character who takes the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (whip) feat is also proficient in the whip-dagger. Unlike standard whips, the whip-dagger's ability to deal damage is unhindered by armor bonuses and natural armor bonuses. Although you keep it in hand, the whip-dagger is treated as a ranged weapon with a maximum range of 15 feet and no range penalties. Because the whip-dagger can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip dagger to avoid being tripped. You get a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed yourself if you fail to disarm your opponent).
#Medium-size
Spring-loaded Gauntlet			KEY:Gauntlet (Spring-loaded)			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Gauntlet (Spring-loaded)														TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Projectile.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:200	WT:4										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d4				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded								RANGE:20	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:This gauntlet possesses a broad ridge of metal that extends along the bottom of the forearm to the edge of the wrist articulation, where a circular orifice is visible. This ridge of metal hides a spring-loaded mechanism that can expel a bolt with great force, akin to a miniscule crossbow. You load the gauntlet by inserting a bolt in the hole and pulling back a hidden lever. Loading the springloaded gauntlet is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity. You fire the spring-loaded gauntlet by sighting down your arm, then flip your hand back so that your palm faces your opponent—this motion fires the gauntlet. The cost and weight are for a single gauntlet. A character who attempts to fire two spring-loaded gauntlets at once incurs the standard penalty for two-weapon fighting. The Ambidexterity feat lets someone avoid the -4 off-hand penalty.
Spinning Javelin				KEY:Javelin (Spinning)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Javelin (Spinning)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Piercing					CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:2	WT:2										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded								RANGE:50	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:This light, flexible spear intended for ranged attacks resembles a standard javelin except for the spiral grooves that run down its length. You can loop a throwing string around the shaft (the other end is tied to your finger). The string imparts spin to the javelin upon release, improving the weapon's accuracy, range, and penetrating power by permitting a harder cast. Looping a string around the javelin is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Tying a casting string around your finger is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, but the same string is reused for multiple javelins. The javelin can be thrown without spinning it, in which case its damage, range, and threat range are those of a standard javelin. If used in melee, treat the spinning javelin as a standard javelin.
#Large
Great Crossbow				KEY:Crossbow (Great)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Crossbow (Great)																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Projectile.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Bolt|SpecificBolt	COST:100	WT:15										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:1d12				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded								RANGE:150	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.6																									SPROP:A great crossbow requires two hands to use effectively, regardless of the user's size. You draw a great crossbow back by turning a winch. Loading a great crossbow is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A Medium-size character cannot shoot or load a great crossbow with one hand at all. With training, a Large creature can shoot, but not load, a great crossbow with one hand at a -4 penalty. If a Large creature attempts to fire a separate great crossbow in each hand simultaneously, the standard penalties for twoweapon fighting apply.
Elven Double Bow				KEY:Double Bow (Elven)				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Double Bow (Elven)															TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Projectile.Piercing				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1	CONTAINS:UNLIM|Arrow|SpecificArrow	COST:1000	WT:3										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded								RANGE:90	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.7																									SPROP:This double-stringed longbow can be used as a normal longbow by anyone proficient in that weapon. Characters with Exotic Weapon Proficiency (elven double bow) can use the bow to fire two arrows at once. Nocking an arrow on the second string requires a move-equivalent action. Once the wielder has taken an action to load the second string, his next attack is a double shot that launches both arrows simultaneously at the same target. The wielder makes one attack roll at a -2 penalty to determine whether or not both arrows strike the target. If the attack is successful, both arrows deal normal damage. If the attack is a critical hit, only one arrow deals extra damage, and extra sneak attack damage is applied only once.
Harpoon												PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Harpoon																	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Piercing					CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:15	WT:10										CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d10				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded								RANGE:30	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.8																									SPROP:The harpoon is a broad-bladed spear forged with barbs. The shaft of the harpoon has a trailing rope attached to control harpooned opponents. Though designed for hunting whales and other large sea creatures, the harpoon can be used on dry land. Even with the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (harpoon) feat, creatures smaller than Medium-size take a -2 penalty on their attack rolls due to the harpoon's weight and bulk. If it deals damage, the harpoon lodges in an opponent who fails a Reflex saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + the damage dealt. The harpooned creature moves at only half speed and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the harpooned creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows (the trailing rope is 30 feet long). If the harpooned creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15) or fail, losing the spell. The harpooned creature can pull the harpoon from its wound if it has two free hands and it takes a fullround action to do so, but it deals damage to itself equal to the initial damage the harpoon dealt. For example, if you hit with a harpoon and deal 8 points of damage, the target takes another 8 points of damage when it removes the harpoon. A character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15) can remove a harpoon without further damage.
Orc Shotput					KEY:Shotput (Orc)					PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Shotput (Orc)																TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Thrown.Bludgeoning				CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1							COST:10	WT:15										CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:2							DAMAGE:2d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded								RANGE:10	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.9																									SPROP:Special training turns a grapefruitsized sphere of crude iron into a deadly projectile. Even with the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (orc shotput) feat, a wielder must be Medium-size or larger to use the weapon effectively (or take an additional -3 penalty on attack rolls in addition to the standard -4 nonproficiency penalty).

###Ammunition
Alchemist's Arrow				KEY:Arrow (Alchemist's)																									TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Arrow.Individual																	COST:75	WT:0.2						BASEQTY:1																	EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD										MODS:YES							SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:Each of these projectiles carries a deadly load of alchemist's fire in its hollow shaft. When it strikes a target, the arrow's shaft shatters, releasing the alchemist's fire directly onto the target. One round after impact, the alchemist's fire ignites, dealing 1d4 points of damage. The target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15) to extinguish the flames. Rolling on the ground earns the target a +2 bonus on the save. Submerging (such as by leaping into a lake) or magically extinguishing the flames automatically kills the flames.
Blunt Arrow					KEY:Arrow (Blunt)																										TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Arrow.Individual.Bludgeoning															COST:0.5	WT:0.2						BASEQTY:1																	EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD										MODS:YES							SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:These arrows have wooden tips specially crafted to deal subdual damage instead of normal damage.
Flight Arrow				KEY:Arrow (Flight)																									TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Arrow.Individual.Piercing															COST:8	WT:0.2						BASEQTY:1																	EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD										MODS:YES							SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:The light shaft and special design of this masterwork arrow increases a bow's range increment by 25 feet.
Signal Arrow				KEY:Arrow (Signal)																									TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Arrow.Individual.Piercing															COST:0.5	WT:0.2						BASEQTY:1																	EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD										MODS:YES							SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:This arrow is specially designed to emulate a bird's call when fired. Elven fletchers craft the arrows to make calls that will be recognized as signals by the elves of the community. For example, a hawk's cry might signal an attack, and an owl's screech might signal a stealthy advance. A successful Wilderness Lore check (DC 20) determines whether the sound comes from a bird or another source. The intricate carving on the arrow shafts makes them clumsy in flight, imposing a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls.
Thundering Arrow				KEY:Arrow (Thundering)																									TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Arrow.Individual																	COST:2	WT:0.3						BASEQTY:1																	EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD										MODS:YES							SOURCEPAGE:p.5																									SPROP:Thunder arrows are tipped with thunderstones (see Chapter 7 of the  Player's Handbook). A hit from a thunder arrow deals no damage but triggers the thunderstone's sonic attack. Thunder arrows that miss should be treated as attacks with a grenadelike weapon (see Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).
Tumbling Bolt				KEY:Bolt (Tumbling)																									TYPE:Ammunition.Standard.Bolt.Individual																	COST:5	WT:0.2						BASEQTY:1																	EQMOD:STEEL.WOOD										MODS:YES							SOURCEPAGE:p.6																									SPROP:A tumbling bolt resembles a standard crossbow bolt except for a few minuscule holes and vents along the shaft. A channel allows air to pass through the bolt, which causes the bolt to tumble when fired. The bolt deals +2 damage but only has one-half its normal range increment due to the way the projectile moves through the air.

###Armor
#Light
Bark																					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Bark										TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:5	WT:15				ACCHECK:-2																				EQMOD:BARK								MAXDEX:5										SOURCEPAGE:p.14	SPELLFAILURE:15		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:This armor is carefully crafted from the tough bark of ancient trees and is treated to prevent it from becoming brittle over time. Strips of bark are layered together over a quilted layer of felt or hide. Bark armor is more flexible than wooden armor but does not provide as much protection. Druids can wear bark armor without losing access to their spells and class features. Bark armor includes arm, leg, chest, and back protection, but it does not include gauntlets.
Bondleaf Wrap																			PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Bondleaf Wrap								TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:1000	WT:2																									EQMOD:PLANT																			SOURCEPAGE:p.14					BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Bondleaf wraps are each crafted from a single enormous leaf found on magical trees. A bondleaf wrap is inactive until worn for 24 hours. During this time, it grows into the skin, drawing water and nutrients from its host. Afterward, as a standard action, you can command it to wrap around your body.
Bone																					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Bone										TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:20	WT:20				ACCHECK:-3																				EQMOD:BONE								MAXDEX:4										SOURCEPAGE:p.14	SPELLFAILURE:15		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|3|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Bone armor is a cloth or leather coat reinforced with strips of bone, often cut from animals used for food. The armor covers the torso but leaves the limbs free for better mobility.
Cord																					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Cord										TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:15	WT:15				ACCHECK:-1																				EQMOD:CORD								MAXDEX:5										SOURCEPAGE:p.15	SPELLFAILURE:5		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Fibers of hemp or other natural material woven and knotted into a thick, tough fabric are the basis for cord armor. The armor forms a complete suit, hampering movement but offering decent protection without the use of metal or leather. Cord armor is particularly popular among wild elves, who often avoid curing animal hide.
Leather Scale																			PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Leather Scale								TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:35	WT:20				ACCHECK:-2																				EQMOD:LEATHER							MAXDEX:6										SOURCEPAGE:p.16	SPELLFAILURE:15		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|3|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Leather scale armor is just like the scale mail described in Chapter 7 of the Player's Handbook, except that the scales are made of cured leather instead of metal.
Moon-ivy																				PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Moon-Ivy									TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:16000	WT:5				ACCHECK:0																				EQMOD:PLANT								MAXDEX:6										SOURCEPAGE:p.16	SPELLFAILURE:10		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|4|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Moon-ivy armor is a close-fitting bodysuit that grows every night and dies at the end of every day. You put on a wreathlike choker before going to sleep. Overnight, a tight but flexible bodysuit of ivy grows over your body. When you awaken, you are wearing a tough, fibrous light armor. Removing the choker causes the moon-ivy armor to wither in 5 rounds. For an additional 500 gp, one of the following types of ivy can be grafted into the armor. Poison Ivy: The ivy exudes a poisonous resin. Once per day, if you succeed on a grapple check, your foe must make a Fortitude save (DC 14). If the defender fails, he takes initial and secondary damage of 1d3 points of temporary Constitution. This poison never affects the wearer. Explosive Spores: The ivy is laced with noxious, explosive spores. Each day, the ivy grows 1d3 spore pods, to a maximum of ten pods. Whenever you are struck in combat with a bludgeoning attack, one of the spores explodes into the space from which the attack came. Anyone in that 5-foot square must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Once all of a day's spores are exhausted, the effect is inert until the next day. This nausea never affects the wearer. Pheromones: Once per day, the ivy exudes pheromones that make you seem more attractive. The pheromones grant a +3 bonus on all Charisma-based checks for 3 hours. The bonus doubles to +6 if you attempt to influence a creature with scent, but moonivy pheromones do not affect constructs or undead.
Wicker																				PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Wicker									TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:1	WT:5				ACCHECK:0																				EQMOD:WICKER							MAXDEX:5										SOURCEPAGE:p.17	SPELLFAILURE:10		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Wicker armor is the poor soldier's last resort. Tightly woven reeds cover the entire body, offering slightly more protection than normal clothes, although the wicker is bulky and loud. The main advantage of wicker armor is its low cost and light weight. Clever armorsmiths sometimes weave thorns into the wicker, effectively creating spiked armor.
Wood																					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Wood										TYPE:Armor.Light.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:15	WT:15				ACCHECK:-3																				EQMOD:WOOD								MAXDEX:4										SOURCEPAGE:p.17	SPELLFAILURE:15		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|3|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Similar to bone armor, wood armor is cloth or leather reinforced with strips of wood.
#Medium
Brigandine																				PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Brigandine									TYPE:Armor.Medium.Suit								CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:30	WT:40				ACCHECK:-5																				EQMOD:STEEL								MAXDEX:2										SOURCEPAGE:p.14	SPELLFAILURE:30		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|4|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Brigandine armor consists of a coat of leather plates, each plate consisting of leather with a strip of steel inside it. It is essentially a light form of splint mail.
Lamellar																				PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Lamellar									TYPE:Armor.Medium.Suit								CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:150	WT:35				ACCHECK:-4																				EQMOD:STEEL								MAXDEX:3										SOURCEPAGE:p.15	SPELLFAILURE:30		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|5|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Similar to splint and brigandine armor, lamellar lies between the two in protective value. It consists of small, overlapping plates of metal sewn together or stitched to a backing of leather or cloth.
Ring																					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Ring										TYPE:Armor.Medium.Suit								CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:75	WT:35				ACCHECK:-3																				EQMOD:STEEL								MAXDEX:4										SOURCEPAGE:p.17	SPELLFAILURE:30		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|4|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Ring armor is composed of tough leather, heavily reinforced with hundreds of small metal rings. Ring armor is the precursor to chainmail and is commonly found in cultures that haven't discovered how to create that type of armor. It is a cheap and effective protection, popular among town guards.
Shell																					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Shell										TYPE:Armor.Medium.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:25	WT:20				ACCHECK:-2																				EQMOD:SHELL								MAXDEX:3										SOURCEPAGE:p.17	SPELLFAILURE:20		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|3|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:This armor is created out of specially treated tortoise shells and more exotic sea life. The armormaking process softens the shells, making them far more pliable and likely to bend instead of shatter when struck. Shell armor includes a breastplate, shoulder guards, and even gauntlets created from smaller and smaller shells. Druids can wear shell armor without losing access to their spells or class features.
#Heavy
Coral																					PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Coral										TYPE:Armor.Heavy.Suit								CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:225	WT:40				ACCHECK:-7																				EQMOD:CORAL								MAXDEX:1										SOURCEPAGE:p.15	SPELLFAILURE:30		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|6|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Commonly worn by warriors of seafaring races, such as merfolk and tritons, coral armor is not so much created as grown. Exotic and rare corals are shaped over time to create armor for a specific person. Someone wearing coral armor that was not grown for them takes an additional -1 armor check penalty. Coral armor covers only the top half of the wearer—breastplate and bracers. Swim speed is reduced by 10 feet when wearing coral armor. However, because of its design, coral armor effectively weighs 10 pounds less in water. Growing coral armor requires the Craft (coralshaping) skill.
Dendritic																				PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Dendritic									TYPE:Armor.Heavy.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:2000	WT:60				ACCHECK:-8																				EQMOD:CRYSTAL							MAXDEX:0										SOURCEPAGE:p.15	SPELLFAILURE:40		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|9|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Dwarf armorsmiths grow dendritic armor from seed crystals deep underground; dendritic armor never reaches the smith's fire. Each suit of dendritic armor is tailored for a specific wearer. This superb armor is socketed rather than riveted together, leaving almost no gaps or chinks. It protects better than full plate armor, but is also heavier and more cumbersome. Dendritic armor constantly grinds crystal flecks off, and regrows itself to its original shape. Anyone tracking a person wearing dendritic armor gains a +2 circumstance bonus on skill checks from the fine trail of crystals left behind. To remove dendritic armor, you must break your way out by succeeding at a Strength check (DC 25). As long as you leave at least 5 pounds of dendritic armor somewhere on your body, the armor grows back in 8 hours.
Dwarven Stone				KEY:Stone (Dwarven)												PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Stone (Dwarven)								TYPE:Armor.Heavy.Suit.Nonmetal						CONTAINS:UNLIM|Armor Crystal=1							COST:1750	WT:80				ACCHECK:-7																				EQMOD:STEEL								MAXDEX:0										SOURCEPAGE:p.17	SPELLFAILURE:40		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|9|TYPE=Armor																SPROP:Found almost exclusively among dwarven kingdoms, this extremely rare armor is created from thin sheets of a specially treated stone resembling marble. Dwarven stone armor is very heavy and more ornamental than practical; consequently it is the dress uniform for many dwarven defenders. It provides impressive protection, as long as the person wearing it does not plan on moving very fast. Dwarven stone armor includes greaves and helmet, but not gauntlets.

###Shields
Beetle Buckler				KEY:Buckler (Beetle)																		PROFICIENCY:SHIELD|Buckler (Beetle)		TYPE:Shield.Buckler								CONTAINS:UNLIM|Shield Crystal=1							COST:6600	WT:5		SLOTS:0	ACCHECK:-1																																								SOURCEPAGE:P.14	SPELLFAILURE:5		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Shield																SPROP:This buckler is actually a Tiny scarab beetle that latches onto the forearm. You must wear the beetle for a full day before the beetle buckler confers any bonus to Armor Class. Once it's attuned to its wearer, the beetle buckler is effectively a masterwork buckler with a nonmagical +1 enhancement bonus to Armor Class. With a command word, you can detach the beetle. Then the beetle takes wing, darting around your body and blocking ranged attacks (as the Deflect Arrows feat, but using the beetle's Reflex save bonus, not your own). The beetle cannot be ordered to attack, but it defends itself if attacked.
Dastana																										PROFICIENCY:SHIELD|Dastana			TYPE:Bracer										CONTAINS:UNLIM|Shield Crystal=1							COST:25	WT:5		SLOTS:1	ACCHECK:-1																				EQMOD:STEEL																			SOURCEPAGE:P.15	SPELLFAILURE:5		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=Misc.STACK															SPROP:This pair of metal bracers can be worn in addition to some other types of armor to provide an additional armor bonus that stacks with both the foundation armor and any shield worn. You can wear dastana with padded, leather, or chain shirt armor. You need the Armor Proficiency (light) feat to wear dastana without penalty.
Stilleto Shield				KEY:Shield (Stilleto)																		PROFICIENCY:SHIELD|Shield (Stilleto)	TYPE:Shield.Light									CONTAINS:UNLIM|Shield Crystal=1							COST:30	WT:10				ACCHECK:-1																				EQMOD:WOOD.STEEL																		SOURCEPAGE:P.17	SPELLFAILURE:5		BONUS:COMBAT|AC|1|TYPE=Shield																SPROP:This small wooden shield has a special switch located on the inside grip. When triggered, four blades pop out from the edges of the shield, and one larger blade springs out from the middle. Triggering and retracting the blades is a free action. When the blades are activated, the stiletto shield counts as a spiked shield in all respects.

By clicking a small switch, the ratchet prevents movement either up or down the rope. This grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Climb checks using a single rope. You can also slide down a rope with this device, which allows rapid movement—basically a controlled fall. It requires a successful Strength Check (DC 15) to hold on when performing this maneuver. A failure means you fall.

It is used to display a personal, family, or royal crest, or as identification on the battlefield.

A creature trying to cross barbed wire must make a successful Reflex save (DC 10) or take 1d3 points of damage and be tripped. A pair of thick gloves is necessary to set up barbed wire.

When water, hops, and other ingredients are added, it creates a thin beer in only a week. The taste is dreadful, but thirsty soldiers take what they can get. The Fortitude save to resist intoxication from this beer has a DC of 10.

Typically, a flask of lawful water deals 2d4 points of damage to a chaotic outsider on a direct hit or 1 point of damage if it splashes such a creature. In addition, lawful water is considered blessed, which means it has special effects against certain creatures. A flash of lawful water can be thrown as a grenadelike weapon (see Grenadelike Weapon Attacks in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but against an incorporeal creature, the flask must be opened and the lawful water poured onto it. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with lawful water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Chaotic water is identical to lawful water, except that it affects lawful outsiders.
