###Block: Illumian
Luminous Sigils										KEY:Illumian ~ Luminous Sigils		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illumian Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	DESC:The sigils that orbit an illumian's head glow softly, providing illumination equal to that of a candle. Illumians can make their sigils disappear by concentrating for a moment (a standard action), but they don't receive the sigils' benefits and can't use any special abilities granted by illumian words (see below) while they're doused. Restoring the sigils to visibility is a free action. Luminous sigils (including power sigils; see below) are insubstantial and disappear into any matter they touch. An illumian's sigils remain present and in effect even when the illumian takes another form, unless she would lose her supernatural abilities as a result of the form change. An illumian wizard who casts a polymorph spell on herself retains her sigils, but an illumian who becomes a zombie loses them.
Glyphic Resonance										KEY:Illumian ~ Glyphic Resonance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illumian Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	DESC:Illumians are the physical embodiment of a magical language, so they interact strangely with symbol-based spells. This group includes all spells whose names contain the word glyph, rune, sigil, or symbol (such spells in the Player's Handbook include explosive runes, glyph of warding, greater glyph of warding, sepia snake sigil, and the various symbol spells). When an illumian encounters such magic, one of two things happens: Either the illumian's resonance overpowers the spell, or the foreign magic corrupts the mystical language that defines the illumian. Illumians have a -4 racial penalty on saving throws against these effects if their level is less than the caster level of the spell. If an illumian's level equals or exceeds the spell's caster level, she is immune to the effect.
Power Sigils										KEY:Illumian ~ Power Sigils			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illumian Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:In addition to the array of dimly glowing luminous sigils that orbits her head, a 1st-level illumian has a single brightly glowing power sigil that grants her certain bonuses (see below). A power sigil can be discerned from other sigils surrounding an illumian with a DC 10 Spot check, and identified with a DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) check. On attaining 2nd level in any class, an illumian gains a second different power sigil, and the bonus granted by each power sigil increases to +2. Depending on the combination of power sigils she chooses, an illumian gains one or more extra special abilities (see Illumian Words, below). The benefit of each power sigil is given below, along with the Common translation of each sigil's Illumian name.

Illumian Words										KEY:Illumian ~ Illumian Words			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illumian Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:Each combination of two power sigils' names makes an Illumian word of great power, and thus grants extra abilities to a character who possesses those two power sigils. The benefit of each word of power is described below.

Final Utterance										KEY:Illumian ~ Final Utterance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Illumian Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:When an illumian dies, her body releases the stored Illumian language within it. For 1 round per Hit Die of the illumian, anyone within earshot hears ululating Illumian syllables-usually gibberish, but occasionally a prophetic phrase or a final curse on the illumian's enemies. The illumian's body need not remain intact for the final utterance to occur. Even if an illumian succumbs to a disintegrate spell, her disembodied voice still utters strange gibberish for several rounds.
