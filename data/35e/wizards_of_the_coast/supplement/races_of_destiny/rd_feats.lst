See the Variant: Half-Humans and Humanlike Races sidebar, page 150, for more about races eligible to select this feat.	TEMPLATE:Assign Race Type ~ Humanoid|Assign Subtype ~ Human
Improved Sigil (Aesh)	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Racial	DESC:You tap into your aesh power sigil to gain enhanced accuracy with your favored melee weapons.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Illumian, aesh power sigil.	PRERACE:1,Illumian	BENEFIT:Your aesh power sigil grants you a +1 insight bonus per power sigil on melee weapon damage rolls with any weapon with which you have selected the Weapon Focus feat.

PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Illumian, krau power sigil.	PRERACE:1,Illumian	BENEFIT:Choose a number of spells with verbal components that you can cast equal to the number of power sigils you have. When you cast one of the chosen spells, the spell's effective level is increased by 1 (as if affected by the Heighten Spell feat, but with no change to the spell's casting time or spell slot). All effects dependent on spell level are calculated according to the heightened level. Whenever you gain the ability to cast a new level of spells, you can reassign the spells you've chosen to be enhanced by this feat. For example, a wizard who reaches 3rd level and gains the ability to cast 2nd-level spells may reassign the spells affected by this feat. Special: If you cast one of your chosen spells using the Silent Spell feat, this feat has no effect.

Inside Connection		SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose a specific organization, such as a town's militia, a particular church, a guild, or one of the illumian cabals (see Chapter 3). You have strong personal connections within that organization, as well as insight into its membership.	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive checks made in conjunction with that organization. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a new organization. The DM should limit characters to selecting only those organizations with which they have a positive or neutral relationship. For instance, a character might not be allowed to select an enemy organization, or one whose existence and/or operations aren't well known to him.

Resourceful Buyer		SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You know where to look in a community for anything you need.	BENEFIT:Whenever you are buying goods, the community you're in is treated as one category larger for the purpose of determining the community's gold piece limit on the most expensive item available (see Table 5-2: Random Town Generation, page 137 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). For example, when you are in a village, the gold piece limit on the most expensive item available to you is 800 gp rather than 200 gp. Special: This benefit doesn't stack with any other effect that grants a similar benefit.
Smatterings			SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a talent for acquiring languages-at least enough of each one to get by.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Int 13.	PRESTAT:1,INT=13	BENEFIT:You can learn enough of a language to ask and understand simple questions, explanations, and instructions. This benefit only applies to verbal communication. After 2d6 days of listening to a new language, you know enough to ask simple questions and to follow simple directions. Upon every future encounter with this language, you need only 1d4 days to regain that knowledge.
Sociable Personality	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Racial	DESC:You are adroit at avoiding social gaffes.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Half-elf, Cha 13.	PRERACE:1,Half-Elf	PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	BENEFIT:You may reroll any Diplomacy or Gather Information checks. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll.

PRERACE:1,Illumian	BENEFIT:You can make your sigils disappear or reappear as a free action. You gain the full benefits of your power sigils even when they are not visible. Normal: Illumians can douse their sigils or make them reappear with a standard action, and they lose the benefits of their power sigils as long as they are doused.
Urban Stealth		SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are particularly adept at moving quietly and unnoticed through the city.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Knowledge (local) 2 ranks.	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (local)=2	BENEFIT:You gain a +3 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks in a small city or larger community. This bonus applies only when you are outside-trying to hide in a bedroom or office does not benefit from this feat, since your knowledge of urban environments is no help in such confined spaces.
Urban Tracking		SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities.	BENEFIT:To find the trail of an individual or to follow it for 1 hour requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check for every hour of the search, as well as each time the trail becomes difficult to follow, such as when it moves to a different area of town. The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depend on the community size and the conditions; see the table below. If you fail a Gather Information check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning. The DM should roll the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn't know exactly how long the task will require. Normal: A character without this feat can use Gather Information to find out information about a particular individual, but each check takes 1d4+1 hours and doesn't allow effective trailing. Special: You can cut the time per Gather Information check in half (to 30 minutes per check), but you take a -5 penalty on the check.
