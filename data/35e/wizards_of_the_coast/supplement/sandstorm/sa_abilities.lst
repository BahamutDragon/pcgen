Death Attack	KEY:Marrulurk ~ Death Attack			SOURCEPAGE:p.170	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Marrulurk Race Trait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		DESC:If a marrulurk studies a victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (marrulurk’s choice). The save DC against a marrulurk’s death attack is 13, and the save DC is Charisma-based. This ability otherwise functions like the assassin’s death attack ability described on page 180 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide and is subject to the same limitations.
Nauseating Breath	KEY:Marrulurk ~ Nauseating Breath		SOURCEPAGE:p.170	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Marrulurk Race Trait.SpecialAttack.Supernatural		DESC:Once per day, a marru lurk can breathe a 10-foot cone of nauseating gas as a free action. All creatures except other marrulurks within the area must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be nauseated 1 round. The save DC is Constitutionbased. See page 301 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for a description of the nauseated condition.

Sneak Attack	KEY:Marrulurk ~ Sneak Attack			SOURCEPAGE:p.171	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Marrulurk Race Trait.SpecialAttack.Extraordinary		DESC:A marrulurk deals extra damage when it is flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus.
