Gliding							KEY:Raptoran ~ Gliding				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																									MOVE:Glide,40																																																																																																																						BENEFIT:A raptoran can use her wings to glide, negating damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. Raptoran glide at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Even if a raptoran's maneuverability improves, she can't hover while gliding. A raptoran can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If a raptoran becomes unconscious or helpless while in midair, her wings naturally unfurl and powerful ligaments stiffen the wings. The raptoran descends in a tight corkscrew and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall.
Pact with Wind Lords					KEY:Raptoran ~ Pact with Wind Lords		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|DESCRIPTOR.Air|1																																																									BENEFIT:Because of the ancient bargain raptorans made with powerful air elementals, raptoran spellcasters cast spells with the air descriptor at +1 caster level.
Unerring Direction					KEY:Raptoran ~ Unerring Direction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BENEFIT:Raptorans have an instinctive sense of which direction is north, even when they are underground or otherwise unable to see the sky or other visual cues. Beyond the Material plane, this ability doesn't function.
Low-Light Vision						KEY:Raptoran ~ Low-Light Vision		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										VISION:Low-Light Vision				BENEFIT:A raptoran can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. A raptoran retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Weapon Familiarity					KEY:Raptoran ~ Weapon Familiarity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					CHANGEPROF:Bow (Foot)=Martial																																								BENEFIT:Raptorans treat the foot bow as a martial weapon rather than as an exotic weapon.
+2 racial bonus on Climb and Spot checks		KEY:Raptoran ~ Racial Bonus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:SKILL|Climb,Spot|2|TYPE=Racial																																																		BENEFIT:Raptoran have strong grips with both hands and feet, and their eyes are unusually keen.
Flight							KEY:Raptoran ~ Flight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																									MOVE:Fly,40																																																																																																																							BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Raptorans can safely fly for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). They can exert themselves to fly for up to twice as long, but then they're fatigued at the end of the flight. Raptorans are likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because raptorans can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, they can remain aloft for extended periods (even if they can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued)|PRELEVEL:MAX=9	BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires no more exertion than walking or running.|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10	BENEFIT:A raptoran can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. A raptoran can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but the raptoran must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. A raptoran can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. A raptoran can use the run action while flying, provided she flies in a straight line.

A killoren can only manifest one aspect of nature's might at a time. Each morning as the sun rises, a killoren spends 10 minutes in quiet meditation, filling her spirit with the aspect of nature that is most needed for her current tasks. Once a killoren chooses an aspect, she manifests that aspect until the next morning, when she chooses again which aspect to manifest. Many killoren favor one aspect over the others and rarely choose to manifest one of the other two aspects.

Aspect of the Ancient					KEY:Killoren ~ Aspect of the Ancient	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Killoren Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:While manifesting the aspect of the ancient, a killoren embodies the deep and ancient secrets of nature itself. With this bond to nature's secret lore, a killoren gains a racial bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks equal to her Hit Dice and gains an additional +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects.

Aspect of the Destroyer					KEY:Killoren ~ Aspect of the Destroyer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Killoren Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:Many races revere nature for its power to destroy, but none more so than a killoren manifesting the aspect of the destroyer. Once per hour (up to a maximum number of times per day equal to the character's Charisma bonus, minimum 1), a killoren manifesting the aspect of the destroyer can make a special smite attack that deals extra damage to the foes of nature. When making this smite attack, a killoren adds her Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per Hit Die. This smite attack works only against aberrations, constructs, humanoids, oozes, outsiders, and undead. If a killoren accidentally smites a creature that is not one of the creature types listed above, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that hour and counts against the total uses per day. While a killoren manifests the aspect of the destroyer, her hair and eyes turn a deep, lusterless black; many find the gaze of a killoren destroyer's coal-black eyes to be unnerving.

Aspect of the Hunter					KEY:Killoren ~ Aspect of the Hunter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Killoren Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:The hunt affects nearly every aspect of nature and claims a place of great prominence and importance in the cycle of life.

While a killoren manifests the aspect of the hunter, her hair and eyes turn a deep forest green, and her skin tone becomes a deeper brown than when manifesting one of the other aspects.

Generalist Wizardry	KEY:Wizard ~ Generalist Wizardry		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A 1st-level elf wizard begins play with one extra 1st-level spell in her spellbook. At each new wizard level, she gains one extra spell of any spell level that she can cast. This represents the additional elven insight and experience with arcane magic. The elf wizard may also prepare one additional spell of her highest spell level each day. Unlike the specialist wizard ability, this spell may be of any school. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's ability to specialize in a school of magic.
Natural Link		KEY:Wizard ~ Natural Link			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, an elf wizard's link to her familiar strengthens. The bonus on skill checks, saves, or hit points granted by the familiar doubles. For example, the cat familiar of an elf wizard grants a +6 bonus on Move Silently checks (rather than +3), a weasel familiar grants a +4 bonus on Refl ex saves (rather than +2), and a toad familiar grants +6 hit points (rather than +3). This increase only applies when the familiar is within arm's reach of the wizard; when the creature is farther away than that, the normal bonus applies (unless the familiar is more than one mile away, in which case no bonus applies, as described on page 52 in the Player's Handbook). This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard familiar's ability to deliver touch spells (normally gained by the familiar of a 3rd-level wizard) and the familiar's ability to speak with animals of its kind (normally gained by the familiar of a 7th-level wizard). If the wizard's familiar already has either of these abilities (for instance, if the character is a multiclass sorcerer/wizard), it loses those abilities when the wizard selects this substitution level.	BONUS:VAR|FamiliarBonus|1
Bonus Feat			KEY:Wizard ~ Bonus Feat				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, an elf wizard gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Defensive Archery, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, or Weapon Focus (longbow/composite longbow or shortbow/composite shortbow only). The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's bonus feat gained at 5th level.

# Ruathar
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Ruathar ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality					SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:You receive Martial Weapon Proficiency as a bonus feat. You can choose the longsword, rapier, longbow (including composite longbow), or shortbow (including composite shortbow). Other than that, you gain no proficiency with any type of weapon, armor, or shield.		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Ruathar Martial Weapon Proficiency|1
Spellcasting			KEY:Ruathar ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other class feature a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a ruathar, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Word of Friendship		KEY:Ruathar ~ Word of Friendship			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike			SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:You learn a short magical phrase that identifies you as a ruathar. While anyone can learn to mouth the words of the phrase, only ruathars are taught the magical key that makes the phrase more than just a few words in Elven. This is a sonic, language-dependent effect and is equivalent to a 1st-level spell. The word of friendship does not influence the hearer’s mind in any way, but all elves know that only ruathars are taught it. Elves addressed in such a fashion generally begin with an attitude of friendly or helpful toward you, unless you are obviously engaged in an evil act.
Gift of the Elves			KEY:Ruathar ~ Gift of the Elves			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality					SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:During the ruathar ceremony, you are traditionally presented with a gift of elven magic to aid you in your travels. This gift takes the form of any one of the following items: boots of elvenkind, cloak of elvenkind, elven chain, a +1 rapier, a +1 longsword, or a +1 composite longbow (Strength bonus up to +4, as appropriate for you). The elves provide whatever gift they deem most useful to you. If the gift is lost or destroyed, you do not receive another one. While you are free to give away or sell the gift, good manners dictate that the gift of the elves should be kept and treasured.
Low-Light Vision			KEY:Ruathar ~ Low-Light Vision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain low-light vision. You can see twice as far as a human in conditions of dim illumination. If you already have low-light vision, you gain improved low-light vision, and you can now see four times as far as a human in conditions of dim illumination.	BONUS:VAR|HasLowlightVision|1|TYPE=Base
Elfwise				KEY:Ruathar ~ Elfwise					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain the uncanny visual acuity and senses of the elves. You gain a +2 bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks. (These bonuses stack with an elf’s racial bonuses.)
Star Blessing			KEY:Ruathar ~ Star Blessing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:At 3rd level, you gain a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls and saving throws while under the night sky (above ground and outside during nighttime).
Arvandor's Grace			KEY:Ruathar ~ Arvandor's Grace			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:When you reach 3rd level, the love of the elven folk actually changes you, instilling in you a glimmer of elven agelessness. Your racial life span and the lower limit of each of your age categories increase by 50%%. If this change places you in a younger age category than you formerly occupied, you retain any ability score bonuses and penalties you previously gained for aging—your aging effectively stalls until you cross a threshold into an age category that’s new to you. For example, a human normally reaches middle age at 35, old age at 53, and venerable age at 70, and his maximum age is 2d20 years beyond that. A 3rd-level human ruathar reaches middle age at 52, old age at 79, venerable age at 105, and has a maximum age of 3d20 years beyond that. If a 40-year-old human became a 3rd-level ruathar, his age category would revert to adult. He would retain the –1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution he took when he previously entered middle age at age 35, as well as the +1 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma he previously received. He wouldn’t age further until age 79, when he would receive the bonuses and penalties for old age. Even elf ruathars can receive Arvandor’s grace; such characters are astonishingly long-lived.
