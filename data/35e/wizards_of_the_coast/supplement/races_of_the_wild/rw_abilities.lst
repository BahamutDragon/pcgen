Gliding							KEY:Raptoran ~ Gliding				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																									MOVE:Glide,40																																																																																																																						BENEFIT:A raptoran can use her wings to glide, negating damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. Raptoran glide at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Even if a raptoran's maneuverability improves, she can't hover while gliding. A raptoran can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If a raptoran becomes unconscious or helpless while in midair, her wings naturally unfurl and powerful ligaments stiffen the wings. The raptoran descends in a tight corkscrew and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall.
Pact with Wind Lords					KEY:Raptoran ~ Pact with Wind Lords		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|DESCRIPTOR.Air|1																																																									BENEFIT:Because of the ancient bargain raptorans made with powerful air elementals, raptoran spellcasters cast spells with the air descriptor at +1 caster level.
Unerring Direction					KEY:Raptoran ~ Unerring Direction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BENEFIT:Raptorans have an instinctive sense of which direction is north, even when they are underground or otherwise unable to see the sky or other visual cues. Beyond the Material plane, this ability doesn't function.
Low-Light Vision						KEY:Raptoran ~ Low-Light Vision		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										VISION:Low-Light Vision				BENEFIT:A raptoran can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. A raptoran retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Weapon Familiarity					KEY:Raptoran ~ Weapon Familiarity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					CHANGEPROF:Bow (Foot)=Martial																																								BENEFIT:Raptorans treat the foot bow as a martial weapon rather than as an exotic weapon.
+2 racial bonus on Climb and Spot checks		KEY:Raptoran ~ Racial Bonus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:SKILL|Climb,Spot|2|TYPE=Racial																																																		BENEFIT:Raptoran have strong grips with both hands and feet, and their eyes are unusually keen.
Flight							KEY:Raptoran ~ Flight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																									MOVE:Fly,40																																																																																																																							BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Raptorans can safely fly for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). They can exert themselves to fly for up to twice as long, but then they're fatigued at the end of the flight. Raptorans are likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because raptorans can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, they can remain aloft for extended periods (even if they can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued)|PRELEVEL:MAX=9	BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires no more exertion than walking or running.|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10	BENEFIT:A raptoran can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. A raptoran can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but the raptoran must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. A raptoran can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. A raptoran can use the run action while flying, provided she flies in a straight line.

A killoren can only manifest one aspect of nature's might at a time. Each morning as the sun rises, a killoren spends 10 minutes in quiet meditation, filling her spirit with the aspect of nature that is most needed for her current tasks.

Aspect of the Ancient					KEY:Killoren ~ Aspect of the Ancient	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Killoren Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:While manifesting the aspect of the ancient, a killoren embodies the deep and ancient secrets of nature itself. With this bond to nature's secret lore, a killoren gains a racial bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks equal to her Hit Dice and gains an additional +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects.

Aspect of the Destroyer					KEY:Killoren ~ Aspect of the Destroyer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Killoren Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:Many races revere nature for its power to destroy, but none more so than a killoren manifesting the aspect of the destroyer. Once per hour (up to a maximum number of times per day equal to the character's Charisma bonus, minimum 1), a killoren manifesting the aspect of the destroyer can make a special smite attack that deals extra damage to the foes of nature. When making this smite attack, a killoren adds her Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per Hit Die. This smite attack works only against aberrations, constructs, humanoids, oozes, outsiders, and undead. If a killoren accidentally smites a creature that is not one of the creature types listed above, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that hour and counts against the total uses per day. While a killoren manifests the aspect of the destroyer, her hair and eyes turn a deep, lusterless black; many find the gaze of a killoren destroyer's coal-black eyes to be unnerving.

A killoren manifesting the aspect of the hunt is bound to nature's ancient tradition of the hunt, and her senses sharpen to an amazing degree. While manifesting the aspect of the hunt, a killoren gains a +2 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks, and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks. While a killoren manifests the aspect of the hunter, her hair and eyes turn a deep forest green, and her skin tone becomes a deeper brown than when manifesting one of the other aspects.

Generalist Wizardry	KEY:Wizard ~ Generalist Wizardry		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A 1st-level elf wizard begins play with one extra 1st-level spell in her spellbook. At each new wizard level, she gains one extra spell of any spell level that she can cast. This represents the additional elven insight and experience with arcane magic. The elf wizard may also prepare one additional spell of her highest spell level each day. Unlike the specialist wizard ability, this spell may be of any school. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's ability to specialize in a school of magic.
Natural Link		KEY:Wizard ~ Natural Link			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, an elf wizard's link to her familiar strengthens. The bonus on skill checks, saves, or hit points granted by the familiar doubles. For example, the cat familiar of an elf wizard grants a +6 bonus on Move Silently checks (rather than +3), a weasel familiar grants a +4 bonus on Refl ex saves (rather than +2), and a toad familiar grants +6 hit points (rather than +3). This increase only applies when the familiar is within arm's reach of the wizard; when the creature is farther away than that, the normal bonus applies (unless the familiar is more than one mile away, in which case no bonus applies, as described on page 52 in the Player's Handbook). This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard familiar's ability to deliver touch spells (normally gained by the familiar of a 3rd-level wizard) and the familiar's ability to speak with animals of its kind (normally gained by the familiar of a 7th-level wizard). If the wizard's familiar already has either of these abilities (for instance, if the character is a multiclass sorcerer/wizard), it loses those abilities when the wizard selects this substitution level.	BONUS:VAR|FamiliarBonus|1
Bonus Feat			KEY:Wizard ~ Bonus Feat				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, an elf wizard gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Defensive Archery, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, or Weapon Focus (longbow/composite longbow or shortbow/composite shortbow only). The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's bonus feat gained at 5th level.

###Block - Prestige Classes
# Arcane Hierophant
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Arcane Hierophant ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SOURCEPAGE:p.108	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcane Hierophant Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:You gain no profi ciency in any weapons or armor. You abide by the same armor restrictions that druids do, and you lose your divine spellcasting ability and supernatural or spell-like class abilities if you wear prohibited armor or carry a prohibited shield.
Spellcasting			KEY:Arcane Hierophant ~ Spellcasting					SOURCEPAGE:p.108	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcane Hierophant Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class and a level in a divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other class feature a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an arcane hierophant, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Ignore Arcane Spell Failure	KEY:Arcane Hierophant ~ Ignore Arcane Spell Failure			SOURCEPAGE:p.108	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcane Hierophant Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:When casting an arcane spell, you ignore the arcane spell failure chance for any nonmetallic light or medium armor (padded, leather, or hide armor). You learn to cast arcane spells while wearing the types of armor that druids favor.
Wild Shape				KEY:Arcane Hierophant ~ Wild Shape						SOURCEPAGE:p.108	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcane Hierophant Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:If you do not already possess the ability, you gain no new ability to wild shape. However, you add your arcane hierophant level to your druid level and gain the wild shape ability of a druid of the resulting level. For example, a character who is a 3rd-level wizard/3rd-level druid/4th-level arcane hierophant has the wild shape ability of a 7th-level druid. If you are not a druid, (for example, if you entered the class as a wizard/ranger), you do not gain the ability to wild shape.
Companion Familiar		KEY:Arcane Hierophant ~ Companion Familiar				SOURCEPAGE:p.108	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcane Hierophant Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Upon becoming an arcane hierophant, you must dismiss your familiar, if you have one. (You do not risk losing XP for doing so.) You may retain any one animal companion you already possess. You add your arcane hierophant class level to your druid or ranger level for purposes of determining your animal companion's bonus Hit Dice, natural armor adjustment, and Strength/Dexterity adjustment (see the sidebar The Druid's Animal Companion, page 36 of the Player's Handbook). For example, a character who is a 4th-level druid/3rd-level wizard/4th-level arcane hierophant has the animal companion of an 8th-level druid (+4 bonus HD, +4 natural armor, and +2 Strength/Dexterity adjustment, or an animal companion chosen from the 4thlevel or 7th-level lists). In addition, your animal companion (if any) gains many of the abilities that a familiar would normally possess. You add your arcane hierophant class level to your arcane spellcasting class level, and determine the Intelligence bonus and special abilities of your animal companion accordingly (see the sidebar Familiars, page 53 of the Player's Handbook). For example, a 4th-level druid/3rd-level wizard/4th-level arcane hierophant has a familiar companion equal to that of a 7th-level wizard and 8th-level druid (Intelligence 9, alertness, improved evasion, share spells, empathic link, deliver touch spells, speak with master, speak with animals of its kind, devotion). # 109 The Hit Dice, hit points, attack bonus, saving throws, feats, and skills of the familiar companion are determined as normal for an animal companion. Due to the familiar companion's unusual Intelligence score, it may very well have more skill points than other animals of its kind. The familiar companion is a magical beast (augmented animal), but you can bestow harmless spells on your familiar companion as if it were an animal instead of a magical beast. If your familiar companion is killed or dismissed, you do not lose XP. You can summon a new familiar companion by performing a ceremony requiring 24 hours of uninterrupted prayer.
Channel Animal			KEY:Arcane Hierophant ~ Channel Animal					SOURCEPAGE:p.108	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcane Hierophant Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:Starting at 4th level, you gain the ability twice per day to establish a magical conduit between yourself and a single animal that you touch (including your familiar companion). For each use of this class feature, a spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the animal instead of from you, provided that you have line of sight and line of effect to the animal. The spell's line of effect then extends from the animal to the target based on the senses of the animal, not you. You can also use this power to deliver touch spells through the animal. Once you cast the spell, the animal is considered to be holding the charge for the spell (see page 176 of the Player's Handbook). Starting at 8th level, you gain two additional uses of this ability each day.
Channel Plant			KEY:Arcane Hierophant ~ Channel Plant					SOURCEPAGE:p.108	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcane Hierophant Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to establish a magical conduit between yourself and a natural, nonanimated plant (but not creatures of the plant type) once per day. This ability functions like the channel animal class feature, except that the line of effect from the plant to the target is based on your senses. You can use this power to deliver touch spells through the plant. Once you cast the spell, the plant is considered to be holding the charge for the spell (see page 176 of the Player's Handbook), except that the spell is delivered to the fi rst creature or object that can receive the spell when the subject touches the plant. At 10th level, you gain a second daily use of your channel plant ability.

# Champion of Corellon Larethian
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:You gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Corellon's Blessing		KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ Corellon's Blessing				SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:Upon entering this class, you gain the ability to heal wounds by touch, much like a paladin's lay on hands ability. Each day you can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to your champion level x your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). For example, a 6th-level champion of Corellon with a Charisma score of 14 can heal 12 points of damage per day. You can choose to divide the healing among multiple recipients, and you don't have to do it all at once. Using this ability is a standard action. You can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using Corellon's blessing in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You decide how much of your daily allotment of healing to use as damage after successfully touching your undead foe. If you have levels in paladin, you add your levels of champion of Corellon and paladin together and determine your ability to heal accordingly (although if you have a Charisma score of lower than 12, your paladin levels do not contribute to your ability to heal).
Bonus Feat				KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ Bonus Feat						SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:At 1st level and every three levels thereafter, you gain a bonus feat. This must be a feat noted as a bonus fighter feat, and the feat must have Combat Expertise, Dodge, or Mounted Combat as a prerequisite.
Elegant Strike			KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ Elegant Strike					SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Upon reaching 2nd level, you become able to place your attacks where they deal greater damage. You apply your Dexterity bonus as a bonus on damage rolls (in addition to any Strength bonus you may have) with any of the following weapons: longsword, rapier, elven thinblade, elven lightblade, elven court sword, or scimitar. Targets immune to sneak attacks or extra damage from critical hits are immune to your elegant strike.
Superior Defense			KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ Superior Defense					SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 3rd level, you learn special techniques for making the best use of an elf's natural agility even while wearing restrictive armor. The maximum Dexterity bonus for any medium or heavy armor you wear (including mithral versions) is increased by 1. For example, full plate armor normally has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +1, but the superior defense ability increases this to +2. At 6th level, you improve the maximum Dexterity bonus of medium or heavy armor by 2 and at 9th level by 3.
Unimpeded Movement		KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ Unimpeded Movement				SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 5th level, you no longer reduce your movement when wearing medium or heavy armor. (You still reduce your movement if carrying a medium or heavy load, however.) If you know the Spring Attack feat, your unimpeded movement ability allows you to use Spring Attack even while wearing heavy armor.
Corellon's Wrath			KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ Corellon's Wrath					SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 8th level, you gain the ability to briefly channel the divine power of Corellon Larethian, enveloping one melee weapon you wield in a veil of incandescent light as a free action. You gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls and deal an extra 2d6 points of damage with each melee attack you make with the affected weapon for 1 round. While Corellon's wrath is in effect, the weapon is considered magic and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier (minimum once per day).
EX-CHAMPIONS OF CORELLON	KEY:Champion of Corellon Larethian ~ EX-CHAMPIONS OF CORELLON			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion of Corellon Larethian Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Few champions of Corellon ever turn to evil, but it occasionally happens. If your alignment changes to evil, you are expelled from the order and lose the supernatural abilities derived from this class (Corellon's blessing and Corellon's wrath). However, you are not barred from gaining more levels in this class if you so desire. You can continue to refine the combat techniques you have learned, but you cannot make use of the class's supernatural abilities.

# Luckstealer

You do not, however, gain any other class feature a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a luckstealer, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Curse of the Fatespurned	KEY:Luckstealer ~ Curse of the Fatespurned			SOURCEPAGE:p.118	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Luckstealer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:By staring at a living opponent for a moment (a move action), you can steal a bit of his or her luck for yourself. Your target must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute. The curse of the fatespurned has a range of 60 feet. The effect cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Your cursed enemy's bad fortune is your good fortune. Whenever you successfully use curse of the fatespurned, you gain 2 points for your luck pool. You can spend points from your luck pool on a 1-for-1 basis to gain a luck bonus on any attack roll, ability check, skill check, or saving throw you make. You decide how many points you're spending before you make the roll. You can also use points from your luck pool to power your desperate recall and fate's proof class features (described below). Unspent points remain in your luck pool for 1 minute. You can't have more points in your luck pool than your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You retain the good fortune (and the points in your luck pool) even if your enemy uses remove curse or another spell to remove his or her bad luck.
Subtle Magic			KEY:Luckstealer ~ Subtle Magic					SOURCEPAGE:p.118	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Luckstealer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:The spells you cast often don't register to divination magic. If a divination is attempted against one of your spells, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level. The subtle magic class feature covers only your spells; the magic items you possess still register normally to detect magic and other spells.
Lucky Magic				KEY:Luckstealer ~ Lucky Magic						SOURCEPAGE:p.119	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Luckstealer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:When you reach 4th level, good fortune infuses the spells you cast. Whenever you cast a spell that has a variable, numeric effect, you can reroll one die out of every five (minimum one reroll). For example, if you cast enervation, you can reroll the 1d4 to determine how many negative levels the spell bestows. If you cast a 15d6 delayed blast fireball, you can reroll any three of the fifteen dice. You must take the results of the new rolls, even if they're worse.
Desperate Recall			KEY:Luckstealer ~ Desperate Recall					SOURCEPAGE:p.119	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Luckstealer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 4th level and higher, you can recover the energy from a spell you just cast, but doing so costs you a bit of the luck you have accumulated. Once per day, as a move action, you can recall any one spell that you had prepared and then cast (if you prepare spells ahead of time) or the energy from one spell slot (if you cast spells spontaneously). The spell or spell slot is then ready for use again, just as if it had not been cast. At 7th level, you can use desperate recall twice per day, and at 10th level, you can use it three times a day. Whenever you use the desperate recall class feature, you have to pay luck's cost: 1 point from your luck pool for a 1st- to 3rd level spell, 2 points for a 4th- to 6th level spells-, and 3 points for a 7th- to 9th-level spell. If you can't afford to pay luck's cost, you can instead lose any luck points you have in your pool and give up a measure of your own personal good fortune: For 1 minute, you take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks, and a -1 penalty to your Armor Class. This penalty stacks with itself and with penalties from the fate's proof class feature and the Dallah Thaun's Luck feat.
Curse of the Black Cloud	KEY:Luckstealer ~ Curse of the Black Cloud			SOURCEPAGE:p.119	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Luckstealer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DESC:At 7th level and higher, you can manipulate the threads of fate itself, causing a thin black cloud to descend over your foes and steal their luck away. This ability functions like the curse of the fatespurned class feature, except that the black cloud curses everyone within a 20-foot spread. The cloud doesn't affect vision, and it naturally disperses a round after you use this class feature. At 10th level, you can use this class feature twice a day. As with curse of the fatespurned, you get the good luck that your enemies lose. You gain 2 points for your luck pool for each living creature that suffers the curse of the black cloud. The luck pool's maximum size is equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). As described in the curse of the fatespurned class feature, you can use points from your luck pool to improve your rolls or to use the desperate recall or fate's proof class features.
Fate's Proof			KEY:Luckstealer ~ Fate's Proof					SOURCEPAGE:p.119	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Luckstealer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 10th level, you have a sense of fate that borders on the precognitive. You gain occasional flashes of insight when you're in danger. For example, in the middle of a battle you might receive an instantaneous vision of a troll rending you limb from limb. By ducking and evading the troll's outstretched claws, you're able to avert a grisly fate. You can use this ability to avoid critical hits, poison attempts, and other particularly dangerous attacks. Three times per day, you can force an opponent to reroll an attack roll, or you can reroll a save you've failed. Announce your decision to do so after you know the full effects of your bad fortune: how much damage the attack deals, the consequences of the failed save, or secondary effects such as poison or improved grab. When you use the fate's proof class feature, the attack begins again from the moment of the attack roll, and the spell or other condition that forced you to make a save begins again from the moment you attempt the save. You must accept the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original result. You can't use fate's proof more than once on the same roll. Whenever you use the fate's proof class feature, you have to pay luck's cost: 5 points from your luck pool. If you can't afford to pay luck's cost, you can instead lose any luck points you have in your pool and give up a measure of your own personal good fortune: For 1 minute, you take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks, and a -2 penalty to your Armor Class. This penalty stacks with itself and with penalties from the desperate recall class feature and the Dallah Thaun's Luck feat.

You do not, however, gain any other class feature a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a ruathar, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Word of Friendship		KEY:Ruathar ~ Word of Friendship			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike			SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:You learn a short magical phrase that identifies you as a ruathar. While anyone can learn to mouth the words of the phrase, only ruathars are taught the magical key that makes the phrase more than just a few words in Elven. This is a sonic, language-dependent effect and is equivalent to a 1st-level spell. The word of friendship does not influence the hearer's mind in any way, but all elves know that only ruathars are taught it. Elves addressed in such a fashion generally begin with an attitude of friendly or helpful toward you, unless you are obviously engaged in an evil act.
Gift of the Elves			KEY:Ruathar ~ Gift of the Elves			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality					SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:During the ruathar ceremony, you are traditionally presented with a gift of elven magic to aid you in your travels. This gift takes the form of any one of the following items: boots of elvenkind, cloak of elvenkind, elven chain, a +1 rapier, a +1 longsword, or a +1 composite longbow (Strength bonus up to +4, as appropriate for you). The elves provide whatever gift they deem most useful to you. If the gift is lost or destroyed, you do not receive another one. While you are free to give away or sell the gift, good manners dictate that the gift of the elves should be kept and treasured.
Low-Light Vision			KEY:Ruathar ~ Low-Light Vision			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain low-light vision.

Star Blessing			KEY:Ruathar ~ Star Blessing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:At 3rd level, you gain a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls and saving throws while under the night sky (above ground and outside during nighttime).
Arvandor's Grace			KEY:Ruathar ~ Arvandor's Grace			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ruathar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		SOURCEPAGE:p.123	DESC:When you reach 3rd level, the love of the elven folk actually changes you, instilling in you a glimmer of elven agelessness. Your racial life span and the lower limit of each of your age categories increase by 50%%. If this change places you in a younger age category than you formerly occupied, you retain any ability score bonuses and penalties you previously gained for agingyour aging effectively stalls until you cross a threshold into an age category that's new to you. For example, a human normally reaches middle age at 35, old age at 53, and venerable age at 70, and his maximum age is 2d20 years beyond that. A 3rd-level human ruathar reaches middle age at 52, old age at 79, venerable age at 105, and has a maximum age of 3d20 years beyond that. If a 40-year-old human became a 3rd-level ruathar, his age category would revert to adult. He would retain the -1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution he took when he previously entered middle age at age 35, as well as the +1 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma he previously received. He wouldn't age further until age 79, when he would receive the bonuses and penalties for old age. Even elf ruathars can receive Arvandor's grace; such characters are astonishingly long-lived.

# Skypledged
Skypledge			KEY:Skypledged ~ Skypledge					SOURCEPAGE:p.126	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skypledged Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:The skypledged receive much of their power from a conduit to the Elemental Plane of Air. In exchange for this gift, every skypledged must be an exemplar of loyalty to his or her elemental patrons. Upon joining the skypledged, you vow to aid air elementals in their struggles against other primal forces of the universe (such as the other elements). As part of this vow, you voluntarily forego casting any spell with the fire, water, or earth descriptors. If you choose to cast a prohibited spell, it functions normally, but you are considered a pledgebreaker (described below) until you pay for your transgression (often with an atonement spell). Spell completion and spell trigger items that reproduce fi re, water, or earth effects are not prohibited. You can use a scroll of wall of fi re or a staff of earth and stone normally.

Calling a Spell		KEY:Skypledged ~ Calling a Spell				SOURCEPAGE:p.127	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skypledged Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Calling a spell from the spellpool can be done at any distance but requires you to have an open, unused spell slot of the appropriate level. When preparing spells for the day, you decide at that time whether to leave some spell slots open. You can call only for a spell of a level that you could normally cast. You can call a number of spells per day whose total levels are equal to or less than half your caster level (round down, minimum one). For example, a 7th-level cleric/1st-level skypledged can call one 3rd-level spell and one 1st-level spell, or two 2nd-level spells, assuming she has slots available and isn't considered a pledgebreaker. When you call a spell, you take a full-round action to concentrate (which does provoke attacks of opportunity). The spell appears in your mind at the beginning of your next turn and can be used immediately. However, if you do not cast the called spell within a number of minutes equal to your caster level, it fades from your mind as though cast.
Spell Availability	KEY:Skypledged ~ Spell Availability				SOURCEPAGE:p.127	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Skypledged Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC:Three stages of access to the spellpool exist. A new skypledged gains divine spellpool I privileges, which grants access to spells of 1st to 3rd level. Starting at 4th level, divine spellpool II allows access to 4th- to 6th-level spells. Starting at 7th level, divine spellpool III grants access to 7th- to 9th-level spells. No 0-level spells are available, but the spellpool can provide any other spell on the cleric or druid spell list in the Player's Handbookeven cleric spells to a druid or druid spells to a cleric.

To pay this debt, you must return spell power to the spellpool, in the form of a spell you have prepared of a level equal to that of the called spell, or a number of spells whose combined levels equal the level of the called spell. For instance, the spellpool debt for a 5th-level spell is fi ve levels, which could be paid off with another 5th-level spell or any combination of spells whose levels total fi ve. Returning a spell's power to the spellpool is a full-round action, like calling a spell, and depletes a prepared spell slot as if the spell had been cast. The debt must be repaid within a number of days equal to your skypledged class level; otherwise, you become a pledgebreaker (see below) and you cannot access the spellpool again until you repay your debt and atone for your transgression. You must repay this debt as a part of any atonement for being a pledgebreaker. You can't build up a positive balance with the spellpool by paying off a debt before incurring it.

You do not, however, gain any other class feature a character of that class would have gained.

You can change the wind direction as you like, and you can change the wind force by one category in either directionfor example, from light to moderate or from severe to strong (see Table 3-24: Wind Effects, page 95 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The prevailing winds change everywhere within a 100-foot radius centered on your location at the time you ask the wind lords for aid. The changes you create with this ability last 1 minute per level, and it takes 1d4 rounds for the winds to shift as you've beckoned. This ability does not function indoors or underground.

Those who survive must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 20 + your Str modifier) or be knocked prone. If you are flying, anyone in an adjacent square takes 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 20 + your Str modifier) or be ejected 2d6x10 feet directly away from you (as if they had been bull rushed that far). Check to see whether a creature is adjacent to you at the start of that creature's turn and at any point during that creature's movement. If you move adjacent to someone, for example, he won't take damage or attempt a save until the start of his turn. If someone moves adjacent to you, he takes damage and attempts the saving throw immediately. The cyclonic doom ability is usable for 10 rounds per day, split up as desired. You can activate or deactivate your cyclonic doom as a free action, but you can't do both in the same turn.

# Stormtalon
Foot Talons			KEY:Stormtalon ~ Foot Talons					SOURCEPAGE:p.132	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Stormtalon Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:The first lesson a stormtalon learns is how to sharpen his or her foot talons so they become weapons. Such sharpening takes an hour a day to maintain, but it turns your feet into claws that deal 1d6 points of damage plus your Strength modifi er. You are considered proficient with these attacks. When you make a full attack, you use your full base attack bonus with any weapons in hand and take a -5 penalty on your talon attack. The Multiattack feat (see page 304 of the Monster Manual) lessens this penalty to -2. You can use your foot talons only when you're airborne. They deal both piercing and slashing damage, so they'll do double damage when you make a dive attack (see page 68). The talons are useful as weapons, but they're not dexterous enough to wield weapons or perform any action requiring fine motor skills.

At 5th level, it's 20 feet faster, and at 9th level, it's 40 feet faster.

You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC even if caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If you already have uncanny dodge from another class, you instead gain improved uncanny dodge (see below), and the levels from that class stack with your levels of whisperknife to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank you.
Sneak Attack			KEY:Whisperknife ~ Sneak Attack					SOURCEPAGE:p.135	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Whisperknife Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage when you are flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus.

Primal Scream			KEY:Wildrunner ~ Primal Scream					SOURCEPAGE:p.140	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wildrunner Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural					DESC:At 2nd level, you become able to bring forth the power inherent within and release it in a blood-chilling scream. Releasing a primal scream is a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A primal scream induces a state of feral frenzy that lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Con modifier (minimum 1). You can use your primal scream ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier (minimum 1). Using a primal scream always requires you to shout, so you cannot use a primal scream if you cannot speak. In this frenzy, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength and a +6 bonus to Dexterity. In addition, your jaw elongates and your teeth become razor-sharp; you gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small, or 1d8 if you are Large). You can wield a weapon in one or both hands at your normal attack bonus and make a secondary bite attack, but in that case the bite attack takes a -5 attack penalty (or -2 with the Multiattack feat). In addition to these effects, a primal scream confers additional benefits as you gain levels, as described below. All effects are cumulative.
