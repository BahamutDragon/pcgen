Gliding							KEY:Raptoran ~ Gliding				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																									MOVE:Glide,40																																																																																																																						BENEFIT:A raptoran can use her wings to glide, negating damage from a fall of any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. Raptoran glide at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Even if a raptoran's maneuverability improves, she can't hover while gliding. A raptoran can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If a raptoran becomes unconscious or helpless while in midair, her wings naturally unfurl and powerful ligaments stiffen the wings. The raptoran descends in a tight corkscrew and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall.
Pact with Wind Lords					KEY:Raptoran ~ Pact with Wind Lords		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|DESCRIPTOR.Air|1																																																									BENEFIT:Because of the ancient bargain raptorans made with powerful air elementals, raptoran spellcasters cast spells with the air descriptor at +1 caster level.
Unerring Direction					KEY:Raptoran ~ Unerring Direction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	BENEFIT:Raptorans have an instinctive sense of which direction is north, even when they are underground or otherwise unable to see the sky or other visual cues. Beyond the Material plane, this ability doesn't function.
Low-Light Vision						KEY:Raptoran ~ Low-Light Vision		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										VISION:Low-Light Vision				BENEFIT:A raptoran can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. A raptoran retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Weapon Familiarity					KEY:Raptoran ~ Weapon Familiarity		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					CHANGEPROF:Bow (Foot)=Martial																																								BENEFIT:Raptorans treat the foot bow as a martial weapon rather than as an exotic weapon.
+2 racial bonus on Climb and Spot checks		KEY:Raptoran ~ Racial Bonus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:SKILL|Climb,Spot|2|TYPE=Racial																																																		BENEFIT:Raptoran have strong grips with both hands and feet, and their eyes are unusually keen.
Flight							KEY:Raptoran ~ Flight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Raptoran Race Trait																																																																																																																																																																									MOVE:Fly,40																																																																																																																							BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), Raptorans can safely fly for a number of rounds equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). They can exert themselves to fly for up to twice as long, but then they're fatigued at the end of the flight. Raptorans are likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because raptorans can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, they can remain aloft for extended periods (even if they can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued)|PRELEVEL:MAX=9	BENEFIT:You are able to fly at a speed of 40 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires no more exertion than walking or running.|PREPCLEVEL:MIN=10	BENEFIT:A raptoran can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. A raptoran can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but the raptoran must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. A raptoran can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. A raptoran can use the run action while flying, provided she flies in a straight line.

Aspect of the Ancient					KEY:Killoren ~ Aspect of the Ancient	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Killoren Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:While manifesting the aspect of the ancient, a killoren embodies the deep and ancient secrets of nature itself.

Aspect of the Destroyer					KEY:Killoren ~ Aspect of the Destroyer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Killoren Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:Many races revere nature for its power to destroy, but none more so than a killoren manifesting the aspect of the destroyer. Once per hour (up to a maximum number of times per day equal to the character's Charisma bonus, minimum 1), a killoren manifesting the aspect of the destroyer can make a special smite attack that deals extra damage to the foes of nature. When making this smite attack, a killoren adds her Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per Hit Die. This smite attack works only against aberrations, constructs, humanoids, oozes, outsiders, and undead. If a killoren accidentally smites a creature that is not one of the creature types listed above, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that hour and counts against the total uses per day. While a killoren manifests the aspect of the destroyer, her hair and eyes turn a deep, lusterless black; many find the gaze of a killoren destroyer's coal-black eyes to be unnerving.

While a killoren manifests the aspect of the hunter, her hair and eyes turn a deep forest green, and her skin tone becomes a deeper brown than when manifesting one of the other aspects.

Generalist Wizardry	KEY:Wizard ~ Generalist Wizardry		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A 1st-level elf wizard begins play with one extra 1st-level spell in her spellbook. At each new wizard level, she gains one extra spell of any spell level that she can cast. This represents the additional elven insight and experience with arcane magic. The elf wizard may also prepare one additional spell of her highest spell level each day. Unlike the specialist wizard ability, this spell may be of any school. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's ability to specialize in a school of magic.
Natural Link		KEY:Wizard ~ Natural Link			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, an elf wizard's link to her familiar strengthens. The bonus on skill checks, saves, or hit points granted by the familiar doubles. For example, the cat familiar of an elf wizard grants a +6 bonus on Move Silently checks (rather than +3), a weasel familiar grants a +4 bonus on Refl ex saves (rather than +2), and a toad familiar grants +6 hit points (rather than +3). This increase only applies when the familiar is within arm's reach of the wizard; when the creature is farther away than that, the normal bonus applies (unless the familiar is more than one mile away, in which case no bonus applies, as described on page 52 in the Player's Handbook). This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard familiar's ability to deliver touch spells (normally gained by the familiar of a 3rd-level wizard) and the familiar's ability to speak with animals of its kind (normally gained by the familiar of a 7th-level wizard). If the wizard's familiar already has either of these abilities (for instance, if the character is a multiclass sorcerer/wizard), it loses those abilities when the wizard selects this substitution level.	BONUS:VAR|FamiliarBonus|1
Bonus Feat			KEY:Wizard ~ Bonus Feat				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, an elf wizard gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Defensive Archery, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, or Weapon Focus (longbow/composite longbow or shortbow/composite shortbow only). The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard's bonus feat gained at 5th level.
