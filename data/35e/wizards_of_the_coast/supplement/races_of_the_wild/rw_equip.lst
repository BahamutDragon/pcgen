Lightblade, Elven		KEY:Lightblade (Elven)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lightblade (Elven)	TYPE:Weapon.Finesseable.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.Light.Elven.Sword										CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1									COST:50	WT:1							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.166																										SPROP:This rapierlike weapon is the size of a short sword, but weighs only as much as a dagger. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, flexible blade slips easily into the seams of armor or between the ribs of a foe. Some elf nobles carry a lightblade-often decorated with intricate filigree and tiny gemstones-as a sign of their station, even if they aren't proficient in its use.
Thinblade, Elven		KEY:Thinblade (Elven)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Thinblade (Elven)	TYPE:Weapon.Finesseable.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.OneHanded.Elven.Sword									CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1										COST:100	WT:3							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:OneHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.166																										SPROP:This rapierlike weapon is the size of a longsword, but much lighter. Dexterous elf fighters and rogues favor it. Its thin, flexible blade slips easily into the seams of armor, or between the ribs of an enemy. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an elven thinblade.
Courtblade, Elven		KEY:Courtblade (Elven)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Courtblade (Elven)	TYPE:Weapon.Finesseable.Exotic.Melee.Standard.Piercing.TwoHanded.Elven.Sword								CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1											COST:150	WT:6							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3							DAMAGE:1d10				EQMOD:STEEL					WIELD:TwoHanded										SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.166																										SPROP:These exotic swords seem impossibly long and thin, tapering to a needlelike point. One edge of the blade is sharpened along its entire length, and the opposite edge is sharpened only for the final quarter near the tip. A courtblade has a basket-shaped hilt (usually made to resemble leaves and vines), a long grip, and a heavy pommel. The weapon is intended for thrusting attacks, but the wielder can slash with it as well. A character can use an elven courtblade in conjunction with the Weapon Finesse feat, applying her Dexterity bonus (if any) to melee attacks she makes with the weapon, though it remains a two-handed weapon and not a light weapon.
Halfling Skiprock		KEY:Skiprock (Halfling)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Skiprock (Halfling)	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Thrown.Ammunition.Bludgeoning								COST:3	WT:0.25					BASEQTY:1		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d6				EQMOD:STONE				MODS:YES							RANGE:15						SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.165																	SPROP:Each skiprock is perfectly weighted and shaped for throwing. If the skiprock hits its target, it ricochets toward another target of the thrower's choice. The second target must be adjacent to the original target (no more than 5 feet away). The thrower immediately makes a second attack roll for the skiprock against the new target, with an attack bonus 2 lower than that of the initial attack. Although they are thrown weapons, skiprocks are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and what happens to them after they are thrown.
Sling, War			KEY:War Sling			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|War Sling			TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Standard.Bludgeoning.Container.Projectile											CONTAINS:UNLIM|Sling Bullet|SlingStone|SpecificSlingStone|Skiprock|Weapon Crystal=1	COST:5	WT:1							CRITMULT:x4	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d8				EQMOD:LEATHER												RANGE:50								SOURCEPAGE:p.166																						BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE|STR																									SPROP:This exotic weapon is a heavy sling used with a special sidearm throw to hurl a skiprock with deadly power. Without skiprock ammunition, a war sling is treated as a normal sling and deals the appropriate damage when used to throw normal sling bullets or stones. A user proficient with both the skiprock and the war sling can ricochet a sling-thrown skiprock just like a hand-thrown skiprock.
Lynxpaw			KEY:Lynxpaw				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lynxpaw				TYPE:Weapon.Finesseable.Container.Melee.Exotic.Double.Standard.Piercing.Sword					ALTTYPE:Weapon.Melee.Slashing			CONTAINS:UNLIM|Weapon Crystal=1											COST:30	WT:4							CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3	ALTCRITMULT:x3	ALTCRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	ALTDAMAGE:1d4	EQMOD:STEEL			ALTEQMOD:STEEL	WIELD:TwoHanded												SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.165						SPROP:A lynxpaw is a double weapon, consisting of a length of finely wrought steel chain with a blade similar to a rapier at one end and a spiked weight at the other. A character can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if he does, he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, as if using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. The lynxpaw's rapier end is a piercing weapon, the lynxpaw's spiked weight end, which resembles a feline paw with the claws extended (hence the name), is a slashing weapon. A character can use either end as the primary weapon; the other end becomes the off-hand weapon. A creature wielding a lynxpaw in only one hand can't use it as a double weapon and can only use one end of the weapon in any given round. A proficient character can make trip attacks with a lynxpaw's chain. If he is tripped during his own trip attempt, he can drop the lynxpaw to avoid being tripped. When using the lynxpaw's chain, the character gets a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed himself if such an attempt fails). A character can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply his Dexterity modifier instead of his Strength modifier to attack rolls with a lynxpaw sized for him, even though it isn't a light weapon.
