Magic of the Land		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																					PRESKILL:3,Concentration=5,Knowledge (Nature)=5,Spellcraft=5	PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=1,Divine=1,Psionic=1				PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Concentration 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks, caster level 1st.										DESC:Your intimate understanding of the natural world allows you to imbue your spells with life-giving magical power from the land itself.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:When in a natural setting, you can draw on the power of the land to imbue your spells with healing power. For the purpose of this feat, a natural setting is defined as any location not within a community and not a constructed area. "Natural setting" includes unworked caverns, but not crafted dungeons and the like. To use the feat, you must succeed on a Knowledge (nature) check (DC 15 + spell level), made as a free action while casting a spell. You can't take 10 on this check. If you succeed, each target of your spell is healed of 2 points of damage per spell level, in addition to the spell's normal effects. If the spell doesn't have a target entry, this feat has no effect. This healing power is positive energy, so an undead creature instead takes 2 points of damage per spell level. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save (at the spell's normal save DC) to negate this effect. If the skill check fails, the prepared spell or spell slot is lost. You cannot use this feat on any spell with an alignment descriptor, nor with any necromancy spell. The natural world favors balance in all things, and thus does not support specific alignment-based magic, nor can its life-giving power be used to enhance the magic of death.

DESC:Your fearsome rage spurs your animal companion to greater heights.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:When you rage, your animal companion gains the same benefits and penalties from your rage that you do, but only if it is within 5 feet of you. The companion's rage ends when your rage ends, or as soon as you are no longer within 5 feet of your companion.
Underfoot Combat		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																		PRESIZELTEQ:S	PRESKILL:1,Tumble=10																			PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Small or smaller, Tumble 10 ranks.																			DESC:You can enter the space that a foe at least two size categories bigger than you occupies.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:You can move into or through a square occupied by a creature at least two size categories larger than you. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for doing so.

Knee Striker: To use this maneuver, you must first move into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. On the next round, the foe is automatically considered flat-footed against your attacks, and you gain a +4 bonus on any roll you make to confirm a critical hit.	BENEFIT:&nl;Underfoot Defense: To use this maneuver, you must first move into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. On any succeeding round in which you remain in the foe's square and fight defensively, use total defense, or use Combat Expertise (minimum -1 penalty on attack rolls), any melee or ranged attack made against you has a 50%% chance to strike the foe whose square you occupy instead. This chance does not apply to attacks made by the creature whose square you occupy.	BENEFIT:&nl;Unsteady Footing: To use this maneuver, you must first move into a square occupied by a foe at least two size categories larger than you. On the next round, you can use a standard action to attempt to trip your foe without provoking attacks of opportunity. If your touch attack to initiate the trip attack succeeds, you can attempt a Strength or Dexterity check (your choice) opposed by your foe's Strength or Dexterity check (as normal) to trip your foe. Your foe may not add any bonus on his Strength or Dexterity check to avoid the trip that he would gain from his size. If your trip check fails, your opponent may not attempt to trip you. If you have Improved Trip, you can follow a successful trip attempt with an immediate melee attack.
Winged Warrior		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter																		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hover																																						PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Hover, must have wings, base attack bonus +4.																	DESC:You use your wings for more than just flying.																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.153	BENEFIT:The Winged Warrior feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Dustup: To use this maneuver, you must be standing in, or flying no more than 10 feet above, an area with a lot of loose debris. If you flap your wings hard as a move action, the draft creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 20 feet. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures 11 to 20 feet away have concealment. At over 20 feet, creatures have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level) to cast a spell.	BENEFIT:&nl;Flying Leap: To use this maneuver, you must move a distance greater than your base land speed during the round. If you do, you gain a +4 bonus on Jump, Balance, and Climb checks because your wings give you lift and stabilize you.	BENEFIT:&nl;Shroud of Feathers: To use this maneuver, you must spend a move action to pull your wings around your body. You cannot be flying during this maneuver. You can then attempt to feint in combat (as described in the Bluff skill description, page 68 of the Player's Handbook) as part of your attack, suddenly spreading your wings to reveal your weapon just as it's about to land a blow. The shroud of feathers maneuver works on a given foe only once per combat. Special: The Hover feat (see page 304 of the Monster Manual) grants creatures of Large size or larger a bigger dust cloud than that granted with the dustup maneuver. Special: A fighter may select Winged Warrior as one of his fighter bonus feats.																																																																										PRETOTALAB:4
Wolfpack			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical																			PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility,Spring Attack																															PRESTAT:1,DEX=5	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dex 15, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, base attack bonus +6.														DESC:You can gain an extra advantage when you and your allies can gang up on a foe.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.153	BENEFIT:You can use the following maneuvers with this feat.	BENEFIT:&nl;Distract Foe: You begin this maneuver when you and at least one ally flank a foe. On the first round, you and your allies gain normal flanking bonuses (+2 on attack rolls). Starting in the second round that you and at least one ally flank a foe, you can make a ferocious attack that forces the foe to concentrate on you and largely ignore your allies. You make a melee attack as a full-round action. If you hit, you make a special Bluff check as a free action; the damage your attack dealt applies as a bonus on your check. The foe you attack opposes your attack with a special Sense Motive check, adding her base attack bonus to the check. If you win the opposed check, your foe turns her attention to you, and each of your allies who are in position to give you a flanking bonus can make an attack of opportunity against that foe.	BENEFIT:&nl;Drive Back: To use this maneuver, you and at least one ally must threaten the same foe, and at least one of those allies must use the aid another action to assist your attack roll. You make a melee attack as a full-round action. If you hit, you make a free bull rush attempt without moving into the defender's space or provoking attacks of opportunity. Resolve the bull rush normally, except that you add the damage your attack dealt as a bonus on the Strength check you make to resolve the bull rush. You can't push an opponent back more than 5 feet with this maneuver.	BENEFIT:&nl;Gang Dodge: This maneuver allows you to use the aid another action to assist all allies who threaten the same foe you target with the action. You use a standard action as normal to aid an ally's defense (see the Aid Another special attack, page 154 of the Player's Handbook). If you succeed, all your allies who threaten your foe gain a +2 bonus to AC against that foe's attacks until the beginning of your next turn, provided that you continue to threaten that foe for that time.	PRETOTALAB:6
Woodland Archer		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Tactical.Fighter																		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot																																				PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Point Blank Shot, base attack bonus +6.																		DESC:You have honed your archery ability in the wilds of the forest.																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.154	BENEFIT:The Woodland Archer feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Adjust for Range: To use this maneuver, you must shoot a projectile weapon against a foe and miss. Subsequent shots you take against that foe this round gain a +4 bonus, because you're able to quickly adjust your aim to compensate.	BENEFIT:&nl;Pierce the Foliage: To use this maneuver, you must hit a foe with a ranged attack despite the miss chance caused by concealment. Shots you take against that foe in the next round don't incur the miss chance because you're able to exactly duplicate your draw and aim.	BENEFIT:&nl;Moving Sniper: To use this maneuver, you must succeed on a sniping attack (see the Hide skill description, page 76 of the Player's Handbook), both hitting your intended target and successfully hiding thereafter. If no one sees you, you can make a sniping attack again in the following round, taking a single move after your attack and before you hide (characters without this feat can only shoot and hide, not move as well). As long as you continue to hit the target and avoid detection from an enemy, you can make a sniping attack on the move each round. Special: A fighter may select Woodland Archer as one of his fighter bonus feats.
