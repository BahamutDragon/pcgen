# Armor
Ectoplasmic Feedback	KEY:ECTOPLASMIC_FEEDBACK	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	COST:8000	TYPE:Armor		SPROP:A suit of armor with this property creates a backlash of positive energy when its wearer is hit by an incorporeal melee touch attack. This deals 1d6 points of damage to the attacking creature (no save). The armor's property has no effect on corporeal creatures.
Ghost Ward			KEY:GHOST_WARD			VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLUS:1	TYPE:Armor.Shield	SPROP:A suit of armor or shield with this property allows its wearer to add the armor or shield's enhancement bonus (but not its armor or shield bonus) to his Armor Class against incorporeal touch attacks (but not against other touch attacks).

# Weapon
Ghost Strike		KEY:GHOST_STRIKE			VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLUS:2	TYPE:Weapon	PRETYPE:1,Melee	SPROP:A ghost strike weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal creatures, regardless of its bonus, just as if it were a ghost touch weapon. In addition, a ghost strike weapon can deliver sneak attacks or critical hits to an incorporeal undead creature as if the creature were not undead.
Profane			KEY:PROFANE				VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLUS:1	TYPE:Weapon.Ammunition	SPROP:Upon command, a profane weapon is sheathed in crackling black negative energy. A living creature who wields a profane weapon when it is so energized takes 1 point of Con damage each round he holds the weapon. The effect remains until another command is given. A profane weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to living creatures (or 2d6 against good outsiders) on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the negative energy upon their ammunition. The weapon is also treated as being evil-aligned (for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction) when sheathed in negative energy.
Profane Burst		KEY:PROFANE_BURST			VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLUS:2	TYPE:Weapon.Ammunition	SPROP:Upon command, a profane weapon is sheathed in crackling black negative energy. A living creature who wields a profane weapon when it is so energized takes 1 point of Con damage each round he holds the weapon. The effect remains until another command is given. A profane weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to living creatures (or 2d6 against good outsiders) on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the negative energy upon their ammunition. The weapon is also treated as being evil-aligned (for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction) when sheathed in negative energy. A profane burst weapon functions as a profane weapon that also explodes with negative energy upon striking a successful critical hit. (This effect occurs even if the target is normally immune to critical hits.) The negative energy burst also deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to a living wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the profane ability (see above), a profane burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of damage to living creatures on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. (Double the bonus dice of damage against good outsiders.) Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the negative energy upon their ammunition. Even if the profane ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra damage on a successful critical hit.
Sacred			KEY:SACRED				VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLUS:1	TYPE:Weapon.Ammunition	SPROP:Upon command, a sacred weapon is sheathed in luminous positive energy. This energy does not harm the wielder unless it is undead, in which case it takes 1 point of Charisma damage per round it holds the weapon when it is so energized. The effect remains until another command is given. A sacred weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to undead (or 2d6 against evil outsiders) on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the positive energy upon their ammunition. The weapon is also treated as being good-aligned (for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction) when sheathed in positive energy.
Sacred Burst		KEY:SACRED_BURST			VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLUS:2	TYPE:Weapon.Ammunition	SPROP:Upon command, a sacred weapon is sheathed in luminous positive energy. This energy does not harm the wielder unless it is undead, in which case it takes 1 point of Charisma damage per round it holds the weapon when it is so energized. The effect remains until another command is given. A sacred weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to undead (or 2d6 against evil outsiders) on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the positive energy upon their ammunition. The weapon is also treated as being good-aligned (for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction) when sheathed in positive energy. A sacred burst weapon functions as a sacred weapon that also explodes with positive energy upon striking a successful critical hit. (This effect occurs even if the target is normally immune to critical hits.) The positive energy burst does not harm the wielder unless it is undead, in which case it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each time the weapon bursts. In addition to the extra damage from the sacred ability (see above), a sacred burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of damage to undead on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. (Double the bonus dice of damage against evil outsiders.) Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the positive energy upon their ammunition. Even if the sacred ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra damage on a successful critical hit.
Necrotic Focus		KEY:NECROTIC_FOCUS		VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLUS:3	TYPE:Weapon	SPROP:The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder's ability drain or energy drain supernatural ability, allowing the wielder to deal ability drain or bestow negative levels through the weapon as if attacking with its natural weapons. If a saving throw against the effect is allowed, add the weapon's enhancement bonus to the save DC. Only melee weapons can have the necrotic focus ability.
