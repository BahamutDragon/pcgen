###Block: Rods
Mace (Heavy).COPY=Rod of Defiance
# 78
Nightstick			TYPE:Magic.Rod	COST:7500	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	SPROP:This black rod carved of darkly stained wood is inset with religious symbols of various deities. Anyone who possesses the rod and is able to turn or rebuke undead gains four more uses of the ability per day. Moderate necromancy; CL 10th
Rod of Defiance.MOD	TYPE:Magic.Rod	COST:13000	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	SPROP:This white cudgel-like rod can be used as a +2 heavy mace. All undead in a radius of 30 feet of the wielder who holds the rod of defiance are treated as if they had -4 turn resistance.Moderate necromancy; CL 10th
Rod of Undead Mastery	TYPE:Magic.Rod	COST:9000	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	SPROP:This metal rod is carved to resemble a stack of miniature skulls. Anyone who holds the rod can control twice as many undead than he normally could. For instance, normally a caster can't control more HD of undead than four times his caster level, but while holding the rod of undead mastery, he can control eight times his caster level of undead. Scepter of the Netherworld: This plain steel baton contains several glyphs incised along its length that promise power over the undead. Anyone who holds the rod and has the power to turn or rebuke undead is treated as if three levels higher than his actual level when he uses his turning or rebuking power. Moderate necromancy; CL 10th

###Block: Wondrous Items
Bagpipes of the Damned		SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:When played, these bagpipes help bolster undead against turning. The piper must make a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check. If successful, all undead within 60 feet gain a +4 bonus on turn resistance for 10 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 10th
Cloak of Turn Resistance	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:This unholy item makes its wearer more diffi cult to turn by adding a +4 bonus on its turn resistance. Moderate necromancy [evil]; CL 10th;
Ectoplasmic Ichor			SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:When this thick, translucent paste is spread onto a corporeal object (requiring a standard action), it allows incorporeal creatures to interact with that object as if they were corporeal (much like a ghost touch weapon). A single vial coats one Medium or smaller weapon, shield, or suit of armor, or any other object of similar size. The effect lasts for 1 hour. Moderate transmutation; CL 7th
Ghost Net				SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:This gossamer-thin netting is thrown like a net, except it only affects incorporeal creatures. If the net hits an incorporeal target, the creature isn't entangled, but instead is treated as corporeal for the purpose of dealing damage to it with physical or magical attacks. It can be hit with normal weapons (though the creature's normal damage reduction, if any, still applies) and there is no 50% chance that it ignores damage from corporeal sources. A creature ensnared by a ghost net also can't turn ethereal (or, if snared on the Ethereal Plane, can't return to the Material Plane). The creature retains all other special abilities, and can extract itself from the net with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The ghost net can't be burst by Strength. Moderate transmutation; CL 7th
Ghoul Gauntlets			SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:When worn by a living creature, these mottled gloves virtually meld with the wearer's own fl esh, making his hands appear gaunt and rotting. Once per round, the wearer can make a touch attack that paralyzes the target for 1d6+2 rounds (Fortitude DC 13 negates). Elves are immune to this paralysis. The wearer can also deliver this attack as part of an unarmed strike, slam, claw, or similar natural attack made with the hand, but in that case must attack normally (and not with a touch attack). The ghoul gauntlets have no effect when worn by a construct or undead creature. If the wearer dies, the gauntlets revert to their normal appearance. Faint necromancy; CL 3rd
Globe of Sunlight			SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:This golden fi st-sized orb can be hurled up to 50 feet. When it arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a sunburst spell (Refl ex DC 22 partial), except that the radius of the burst is only 40 feet. Strong evocation; CL 15th
Goggles of Day			SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:The lenses of this item are made of silvered crystal. When placed over the eyes, the wearer can operate without penalty in preternaturally bright light, such as might result from a fl are, sunbeam, or sunburst spell. A bonus side effect allows vampires a full-round action prior to dissolution when confronted with sunlight, as opposed to just a partial action. Faint transmutation; CL 3rd
Goggles of Lifesight		SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:The wearer of these goggles automatically knows whether any visible creature within 30 feet is alive, dead, undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct). Moderate divination; CL 9th
Husk Globe				SOURCEPAGE:p.78	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:The bodies of humanoid creatures sacrificed according to special rituals of necromancy can be placed in globes of glass or crystal, so they remain perfectly preserved and on display indefinitely. Moreover, husk globes retain the imprinted knowledge once possessed by the corpse preserved within. Anyone who runs a hand across the surface of the globe and commands the occupant to speak by their correct name can ask questions of it. The questioner may ask up to ten questions once the corpse is activated. The corpse answers telepathically, mentally audible to all within 30 feet of the globe. The husk's knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive. The husk can be activated once per week. The husk can learn new information if told while active, and that information may be retrieved later by different questioners. Moderate necromancy; CL 10th
Lyre of the Restful Soul	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:When played, this lyre weakens the ability of undead creatures to resist turning or rebuking. The drummer makes a DC 15 Perform (string instruments) check. If successful, all undead within 60 feet take a -4 penalty to turn resistance (which can lower their effective HD for turning to below their normal HD, but not lower than 1) for 10 rounds. Moderate necromancy; CL 10th
Night Caller			SOURCEPAGE:p.79	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:This whistle is transparent but weighty as if forged of iron, not glass. The whistle resembles a small dragon curled up like a snail. When blown over a grave containing a body in darkness or at night, one corpse below animates and claws its way to the surface. The zombie serves the whistler faithfully until it is destroyed, as if it were created with animate dead. The whistle can be used once per week; however, the whistler can acquire no more than two zombie followers at any one time using night caller. Faint necromancy; CL 5th
Nycoptic Manuscripts		SOURCEPAGE:p.79	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:These twin papyrus scrolls are inscribed with ancient tales and cryptic prophecies by an anonymous, almost-certainly insane author. Despite their dubious accuracy, the manuscripts contain many useful descriptions of spells from the school of necromancy, and grant the possessor a +5 competence bonus on any Knowledge (arcana) check she makes that deals with necromantic topics as the long as the scrolls are in her possession and the character can take 1d4 rounds to fi nd the proper reference. Moderate necromancy; CL 10th
Unholy Shrouds (Lesser)		SOURCEPAGE:p.79	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:These shrouds look like ordinary funerary wrappings for dead bodies and are often decorated with symbols and icons representing the dead rising. If a dead body is wrapped in the shrouds, and the command word spoken, it returns as an undead creature. The kind of undead it returns as is determined by the type of shrouds-lesser shrouds animate the corpse as a ghast, while greater shrouds turn the body into a wraith. The undead creature is not under anyone's control when it rises, though it may be commanded or controlled by the normal means. Wrapping a body takes 10 minutes. The magic of the shrouds is usable once only, after which the wrappings turn to dust. Strong necromancy; CL 12th (lesser) or 16th (greater);
Unholy Shrouds (Greater)	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	TYPE:Wondrous.Magic	SPROP:These shrouds look like ordinary funerary wrappings for dead bodies and are often decorated with symbols and icons representing the dead rising. If a dead body is wrapped in the shrouds, and the command word spoken, it returns as an undead creature. The kind of undead it returns as is determined by the type of shrouds-lesser shrouds animate the corpse as a ghast, while greater shrouds turn the body into a wraith. The undead creature is not under anyone's control when it rises, though it may be commanded or controlled by the normal means. Wrapping a body takes 10 minutes. The magic of the shrouds is usable once only, after which the wrappings turn to dust. Strong necromancy; CL 12th (lesser) or 16th (greater);

###Block: Grafts
Bonemail		SOURCEPAGE:p.79	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:Bonemail resembles armor crafted from interlocking bones and shards of bone, but is actually part of the grafted creature's body. Bonemail grants a +2 natural armor bonus to the grafted creature's AC.	BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=NaturalArmor.STACK
Bodak's Eye		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This white, empty eye fi ts into a humanoid creature's empty eye socket and allows the grafted creature to make a death gaze attack once per day. The creature must use a standard action to target a creature with the gaze, and the range of the effect is 30 feet. A DC 15 Fortitude save negates the effect. Unlike an actual bodak's death gaze, a target that dies from this attack does not transform into a bodak 24 hours later.
Enervating Arm	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:An enervating arm is a gaunt limb of desiccated, leathery fl esh. It grants a +4 inherent bonus to the grafted creature's Strength. Twice per day, the grafted creature can use an enervating touch to bestow one negative level on a living creature. Removing the negative level requires a DC 14 Fortitude save. A touch that misses does not count against the daily limit.		BONUS:STAT|STR|4|TYPE=Inherent
Eye of Flame	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This crimson eye-shaped gem fi ts into a humanoid creature's empty eye socket and can produce a fi reball once per day upon command. The fi reball deals 10d6 points of damage (Refl ex DC 14 half). Half of the damage is fi re damage, and the other half is divine damage that affects even targets resistant to fi re.
Ghostly Arm		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This gray, incorporeal arm can't be used to manipulate solid objects. However, the grafted creature can use the ghostly arm to deliver an incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, the equivalent of a ghost's corrupting touch attack. Treat the arm as a secondary weapon, but because it is incorporeal the arm has no Strength score and therefore gains no bonus or penalty on damage rolls from the user's Strength.
Mohrg's Tongue	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This long, cartilaginous tongue bears sharp claws at its tip. The grafted creature can make touch attacks with the tongue (treat it as a secondary weapon). A successful touch paralyzes the target for 1d4 minutes (Fortitude DC 17 negates).
Mummified Eye	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This hard, round orb fi ts into a humanoid creature's empty eye socket and looks much like a normal eye at fi rst glance, but it has a distinctly dry appearance and does not move in the socket. The grafted creature can use the eyebite spell as a 12th-level caster once per day.
Mummified Hand	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This withered hand is swathed in the remnants of funereal wrappings. The grafted creature can use the mummifi ed hand to deliver a slam attack; the damage dealt is the same as that dealt by a zombie of the creature's size. In addition, three times per day the grafted creature can deliver mummy rot with a slam attack. The choice to use mummy rot must be made before the attack is rolled; if the attack misses, the daily use is lost. The Fortitude save to resist the mummy rot is DC 16.
Paralyzing Arm	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:A paralyzing arm is a hardy limb of preserved undead fl esh. It grants a +4 inherent bonus to the grafted creature's Strength. Twice per day, the grafted creature can use a paralyzing touch. A living creature touched must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed for 1d6+2 minutes. Elves are immune to this paralyzing touch. A touch that misses does not count against the daily limit.
Skeletal Hand	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:The grafted creature can use this bony hand to make claw attacks. The damage dealt is the same as that dealt by a skeleton of the creature's size.
Undead Skin		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This mottled gray hide grants the grafted creature 25%% resistance to critical hits and sneak attacks, similar to armor of light fortifi cation. This resistance doesn't stack with similar abilities.
Vampiric Fangs	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:This set of sharp teeth replaces the creature's existing teeth. The grafted creature gains the ability to drain blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round. On each such successful drain attack, the grafted creature gains 5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.
Weakening Arm	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:weakening arm is a skeletal forelimb that grants a +4 inherent bonus to the grafted creature's Strength. Twice per day, the grafted creature can use a weakening touch.A living creature touched takes 1d6 points of Strength damage. A touch that misses does not count against the daily limit.	BONUS:STAT|STR|4|TYPE=Inherent
Zombie Arm		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	TYPE:Undead Graft	SPROP:A zombie arm is a perpetually rotting limb. It grants a +2 inherent bonus to the grafted creature's Strength, but also permanently reduces the grafted creature's Dexterity by 2. The grafted creature can use the zombie arm to make slam attacks; the damage dealt is the same as that dealt by a zombie of the creature's size.
