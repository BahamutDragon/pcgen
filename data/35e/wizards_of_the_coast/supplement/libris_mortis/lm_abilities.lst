Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Death's Chosen ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death's Chosen Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:Death's chosen gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Shield of the Master		KEY:Death's Chosen ~ Shield of the Master			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death's Chosen Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:Whenever the master of a death's chosen casts a spell or uses an extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability, it can choose (as a free action) to exempt the death's chosen from its effects. The master must make this choice when it casts the spell or uses the ability. If the ability is always active, the master can choose to exempt its death's chosen from the effect; this immunity remains in effect until the master chooses otherwise. For example, a mummy could (and probably would) choose to make its death's chosen immune to its despair ability. An undead spellcaster casting a fireball into a fight that included its death's chosen could choose when casting the spell to have it not affect the death's chosen.
Vigor of the Chosen		KEY:Death's Chosen ~ Vigor of the Chosen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death's Chosen Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:The physical needs of a death's chosen are greatly reduced. He needs to consume only one-tenth the normal amount of food and water each day-a few grubs and a mouthful of water make a full meal. He can subsist on a mere 2 hours of sleep each night without becoming fatigued (though spellcasters require the normal amount of rest to regain spells). He gains Endurance as a bonus feat (or, if he already has the feat, the bonuses granted by the feat increase to +8). He also gains a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease.
Will of the Chosen		KEY:Death's Chosen ~ Will of the Chosen			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death's Chosen Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a death's chosen serves his master with inhuman intensity. He gains a +2 morale bonus on Will saves as long as he is within 60 feet of his master.
Bravery of the Chosen		KEY:Death's Chosen ~ Bravery of the Chosen		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death's Chosen Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:When within 30 feet of his master, a death's chosen who has attained 3rd level gains a +1 morale bonus on melee attack rolls and melee damage rolls. If his master has been reduced to half or less of its full normal hit points, this bonus increases to +2. The bonus disappears if his master is destroyed.
Unnatural Aura			KEY:Death's Chosen ~ Unnatural Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death's Chosen Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:When a death's chosen reaches 3rd level, wild or domesticated animals can sense his unnatural presence out to a distance of 30 feet. The animals do not willingly approach nearer than that and become panicked if forced to do so. They remain panicked as long as they are within that distance.

###Block: Dirgesinger
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Dirgesinger ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dirgesinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.43	DESC:Dirgesingers gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.
Dirgesong				KEY:Dirgesinger ~ Dirgesong					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dirgesinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	DESC:A dirgesinger gains the dirgesong ability. Dirgesong follows the same rules as bardic music (see Bardic Music, page 29 of the Player's Handbook). Dirgesinger levels stack with bard levels for the purpose of determining how often a character can use dirgesong or bardic music. Dirgesinger levels do not stack with bard levels for determining which bardic music effects and spells a bard has access to. Each of these songs counts as a use of bardic music.
Song of Sorrow			KEY:Dirgesinger ~ Song of Sorrow				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dirgesinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:A dirgesinger can evoke sorrow and lament in his enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the dirgesinger perform. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the dirgesinger perform and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected enemy takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws and a -2 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. A successful Will save (DC 10 + the dirgesinger's ranks in Perform) negates the effect and makes the character immune to that dirgesinger's song of sorrow ability for 24 hours. Song of sorrow is a mind-affecting ability.
Song of Bolstering		KEY:Dirgesinger ~ Song of Bolstering			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dirgesinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a dirgesinger can bolster undead creatures against turning, much as an evil cleric does. All undead within 30 feet of the dirgesinger gain a bonus on their turn resistance equal to the dirgesinger's class level plus the dirgesinger's bard class level. The bolstering lasts for as long as the dirgesinger performs and for 10 rounds thereafter. An undead dirgesinger can bolster himself in this manner.
Song of Grief			KEY:Dirgesinger ~ Song of Grief				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dirgesinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:A dirgesinger of 3rd level or higher can use song or poetics to inspire maddening grief in a living creature. The creature must be within 60 feet of the dirgesinger and able to hear him. Unless the target succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + the dirgesinger's ranks in Perform), she becomes confused for as long as the dirgesinger performs and for 5 rounds thereafter. Song of grief is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.
Song of Horror			KEY:Dirgesinger ~ Song of Horror				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dirgesinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:At 4th level and higher, a dirgesinger can strike a horrifying chord in the hearts of his enemies. Any enemy within 60 feet who can hear the dirgesinger must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + the dirgesinger's ranks in Perform) or take 1d6 points of Strength damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. A creature that is affected by a dirgesinger's song of horror or a creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same dirgesinger's song of horror for 24 hours.
Song of Awakening			KEY:Dirgesinger ~ Song of Awakening				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dirgesinger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:At 5th level, a dirgesinger can animate the recently slain corpse of a creature within 30 feet. This requires the dirgesinger to make a Perform check (DC 10 + target creature's HD). The slain creature can have no more Hit Dice than the dirgesinger's character level. If the attempt fails, the dirgesinger can try again in a later round. The corpse to be awakened must have been dead for no more than 1 hour. The awakened creature's type becomes undead, and it retains any subtypes it had. The creature retains all class features, as well as any supernatural or spell-like (but not extraordinary) abilities it possessed in life (though any spells cast or daily uses expended before the creature's death count against its normal limits). The awakened creature is completely loyal to the dirgesinger and obeys any commands given it (if no commands are given, it simply attacks the dirgesinger's foes). The creature remains animate as long as the dirgesinger continues to perform. A dirgesinger can animate no more than one awakened corpse at a time. If he awakens a second one while the first is still active, the first one falls dead as if the dirgesinger had ceased to perform.

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Master of Radiance ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Radiance Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a master of radiance gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats and so on; but see Turn Undead, below). If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a master of radiance, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Turn Undead				KEY:Master of Radiance ~ Turn Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Radiance Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:Master of radiance class levels stack with levels of all other classes that grant the ability to turn undead for the purpose of determining the character's effective cleric level for turning. See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the Player's Handbook. For example, a 7th-level cleric/5th-level master of radiance turns undead as a 12th-level cleric.
Radiant Aura			KEY:Master of Radiance ~ Radiant Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Radiance Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:A master of radiance can emanate an aura of brilliant light that weakens undead creatures. The aura provides bright illumination in a 30-foot radius around the character, and shadowy illumination for an additional 30 feet beyond that. Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of the bright aura. In addition, undead creatures within the radius of bright light take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Activating the radiant aura is a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. While her radiant aura is active, a master of radiance casts spells with the light descriptor at +2 caster level. A master of radiance can use this ability once per day at 1st level, twice per day at 3rd level, and three times per day at 5th level. Each use lasts 1 minute. The radiant aura is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell with the light descriptor for the purpose of interacting with spells and effects with the darkness descriptor.
Searing Light			KEY:Master of Radiance ~ Searing Light				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Radiance Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a master of radiance can use searing light as a standard action once per round as long as her radiant aura is active. Treat the character's caster level for this effect as equal to her highest divine caster level, including the +2 caster level adjustment for the radiant aura (for example, a 7th-level druid/2nd-level master of radiance would use this effect as a 10th-level spellcaster).
Beam of Sunlight			KEY:Master of Radiance ~ Beam of Sunlight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Radiance Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:A 5th-level master of radiance can evoke a dazzling beam of intense light (the equivalent of a beam from the sunbeam spell) once per round as a full-round action as long as her radiant aura is active. Treat the character's caster level for this effect as equal to her highest divine caster level, including the +2 caster level adjustment for the radiant aura (for example, a 7th-level druid/5th-level master of radiance would use this effect as a 13th-level spellcaster).

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats and so on; but see Rebuke Undead, below). If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a master of shrouds, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Extra Rebuking			KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Extra Rebuking				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:A master of shrouds may use her rebuke undead ability four additional times per day.
Rebuke Undead			KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Rebuke Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Master of shrouds class levels stack with levels of all other classes that grant the ability to rebuke undead for the purpose of determining the character's effective cleric level for rebuking. See Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the Player's Handbook. For example, a 7th-level cleric/5th-level master of shrouds rebukes undead as a 12th-level cleric.
Summon Undead			KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Summon Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a master of shrouds can summon one or more incorporeal undead creatures a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This ability is otherwise identical to the summon monster spells, except that a master of shrouds adds her Charisma modifier (if positive) to the duration of the effect. At 2nd level, a master of shrouds can summon a single shadow. At 4th level, she can summon one wraith or two shadows. At 6th level, she can summon one spectre, two wraiths, or four shadows. At 8th level, she can summon one greater shadow, two spectres, four wraiths, or four shadows. At 10th level, she can summon one dread wraith, two greater shadows, four spectres, four wraiths, or four shadows.
Improved Summoning		KEY:Master of Shrouds ~ Improved Summoning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master of Shrouds Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.47	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, a master of shrouds summons more powerful undead creatures than normal.

Spells per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Pale Master ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pale Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a pale master gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a pale master, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
Animate Dead			KEY:Pale Master ~ Animate Dead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pale Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a pale master begins to exercise control over the undead. Once per day, he can use animate dead, as the spell, without need of a material component. Use the pale master's highest arcane caster level as the caster level for this effect. All other level restrictions of animate dead still apply. For example, a 6th-level sorcerer/3rd-level pale master can animate up to 16 HD of undead with a single use of this ability. Likewise, he can control up to 32 HD of undead created using this ability, the animate dead spell, or both.
Darkvision				KEY:Pale Master ~ Darkvision					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pale Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:At 3rd level, the dark begins to lose its mysteries to a pale master, who gains darkvision out to 60 feet.

At 4th level and higher, he treats the undead armor as if its arcane spell failure chance were 10%% less. At 8th level, this reduction improves to 20%%.
Control Undead			KEY:Pale Master ~ Control Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pale Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:Once per day, a pale master of 5th level or higher can gain control over an undead creature (with Hit Dice equal to or less than his highest arcane caster level) by making a successful touch attack against it. The undead creature receives no saving throw to resist this effect. The control lasts for 1 round per class level. When the duration expires, the undead creature returns to its former allegiance, if any. The newly controlled undead can still be turned or rebuked as normal. This effect is otherwise identical to the control undead spell. This ability is in addition to the number of undead a pale master can control using his animate dead ability.
Deathless Vigor			KEY:Pale Master ~ Deathless Vigor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pale Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, a pale master's body becomes more akin to the undying flesh of his undead associates. The character gains a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves except against effects that also work on objects.
Undead Graft			KEY:Pale Master ~ Undead Graft				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pale Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:At 6th level, a pale master gives in to terrible necrophiliac urges. He cuts off his arm and replaces it with an undead prosthetic, which may be skeletal in form or preserved flesh stitched in place like that of a flesh golem. Regardless of its composition, the graft grants a +4 inherent bonus to the character's Strength score. Additionally, the undead graft allows him to deliver horrible touch attacks. A pale master can use this ability once per day at 6th level, twice per day at 8th level, and three times per day at 10th level. The character must declare that he is using this ability before making the attack roll; a failed attack roll still expends that use of the ability. Each time he makes a touch attack using this ability, the pale master can select from any of the effects described below for which he meets the prerequisite class level. The save DC for the pale master's touch attacks is 10 + his pale master class level + his Cha modifier.

A slain creature automatically animates 1 round later as a zombie (see page 265 of the Monster Manual) and is under the pale master's control as if he had animated it. Undead created using this power do not count against a pale master's HD total for controlling undead. Prerequisite: Class level 10th.

The cohort follows the rules for undead cohorts described under the Undead Leadership feat (see page 31). The pale master does not gain any followers from this ability, only a single cohort. The cohort's effective character level is determined by the pale master's Leadership score and character level exactly as if the cohort had been gained by means of the Undead Leadership feat.
Deathless Mastery			KEY:Pale Master ~ Deathless Mastery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Pale Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:On reaching 10th level, a pale master gains the virtues of his deathless arts.

Turn Undead				KEY:Sacred Purifier ~ Turn Undead					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sacred Purifier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:Sacred purifier class levels stack with levels of all other classes that grant the ability to turn undead for the purpose of determining the character's effective cleric level for turning.

Sacred Strike			KEY:Sacred Purifier ~ Sacred Strike					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Sacred Purifier Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.49	DESC:Whenever a sacred purifier of 3rd level or higher successfully strikes an undead creature in melee, he can spend a turning attempt as a free action to deal an extra 2d6 points of damage with that attack.

Deathly Power			KEY:Lurking Terror ~ Deathly Power					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Lurking Terror Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:A lurking terror adds its class level to any save DCs for the extraordinary and supernatural special attacks possessed by an undead creature of its kind. This ability has no effect on the lurking terror's spells or spell-like abilities, nor on any special abilities gained from its nonundead kind (such as a vampiric medusa's petrifying gaze), feats, or class features (such as the assassin's death attack). For example, a vampire that becomes a 1st-level lurking terror increases the DC of its dominate and energy drain special attacks by 1. If the vampire were also a sorcerer with the Stunning Fist feat, neither its spell save DCs nor the save DC for its stunning attacks would be affected.
Improved Darkvision		KEY:Lurking Terror ~ Improved Darkvision				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Lurking Terror Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:At 2nd level, the effective distance of a lurking terror's darkvision improves to 90 feet.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known	KEY:Master Vampire ~ Spells Per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Master Vampire Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.56	DESC:At each odd-numbered level, a master vampire gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if it had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which it belonged before adding the prestige class level. It does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If the creature had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a master vampire, it must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
