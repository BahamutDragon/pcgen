The form you assume looks half-decayed, with missing patches of fur and rotted, worm-eaten fl esh. While you are in this form, the rank odor of death hangs around you.

For example, if Tordek (Con 15) is struck by a wight, he gains one negative level. However, he can ignore the 1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks associated with that negative level for 2 minutes, since his Constitution bonus is +2.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:3					SOURCEPAGE:p.26	BENEFIT:You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes. Any living creature that could normally be raised as a zombie and that does not possess more than double your Hit Dice, when slain outright by a fell animated spell, rises as a zombie under your control at the beginning of your next action. Even if you kill several creatures with a single fell animated spell, you cant create more Hit Dice of undead than twice your caster level. The standard rules for controlling undead (see animate dead, page 198 of the Players Handbook) apply to newly created undead gained through this metamagic feat. A fell animated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spells actual level.

On days when you have created a reserve, you are weakened but not destroyed when you are dealt enough damage to reduce your hit points to 0 or lower. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can it take full-round actions). It moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesnt risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) immediately expends the necrotic reserve. Unless the action increased the weakened undeads hit points, it is destroyed. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve is also destroyed if it is dealt additional damage after the attack that fi rst weakened it.

Profane Vigor										TYPE:Divine																						PREFEAT:1,Rebuke Undead																																										PRESTAT:1,CHA=11																																																																																																																																																																				DESC:You can channel negative energy to heal nearby undead allies of physical damage.

You need not have the requisite ability score to cast the spell (for instance, you need not have an Intelligence of 13 or higher to cast a fi reball drained from the mind of a wizard). The spell remains in your mind for up to 1 hour. You can have a maximum number of stolen spells equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1); any spells that you would gain above this number are simply lost. This feat has no effect on spellcasters who dont prepare spells (such as a sorcerer, who simply loses one spell slot for each negative level bestowed as normal) or who have no spells prepared (such as a fi ghter, or a wizard who has cast all her spells).
Spurn Death's Touch									TYPE:Divine																						PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Turn Undead																																																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:You can channel divine energy to remove some of the harmful effects of attacks made by undead creatures.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can spend one of your turning attempts for the day to touch an ally to heal 1d4 points of ability damage, remove a paralysis effect, or remove a negative level. You can only use this effect to heal ability damage dealt by an undead creature or remove effects caused by an undead creature.
Stitched Flesh Familiar									TYPE:General																																																			PRESA:1,Summon Familiar							PRESPELLSCHOOL:3,Necromancy=0																																																																																																																																																																							DESC:When you are ready and able to acquire a new familiar, you may choose to gain a stitched flesh familiar.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:When choosing a familiar, you may choose a stitched flesh familiar. A stitched fl esh familiar appears similar to any of the standard familiars available in the Players Handbook, except that the stitched fl esh familiar is obviously sewn together from many different creatures of that kind and, to a practiced eye, is clearly an undead creature. A stitched fl esh familiar is magically linked to its master in the same way as a normal familiar. A stitched fl esh familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual, except as noted below. Hit Dice: A stitched fl esh familiar has a d12 Hit Die and gains no bonus hit points from Constitution (since it is an undead creature). For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the masters character level or the familiars normal Hit Dice total, whichever is higher. Hit Points: Use 1/2 the masters total or the familiars normal total, whichever is higher. Attacks: Use the masters base attack bonus or the familiars, whichever is higher. Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiars base save bonus or the masters (as calculated from his character level), whichever is higher. Familiar Special Abilities: Use the second table in the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Players Handbook to determine additional abilities, just as you would for a normal familiar. Stitched fl esh familiars do not grant their masters any of the benefi ts that appear on the fi rst table in that sidebar. Instead of the noted special ability, a stitched fl esh familiar grants its master the ability to control 4 more Hit Dice of undead than he is normally capable of controlling (both through the rebuke undead ability and through spells such as animate dead).

Its power has hardened your fl esh and given it the foul look of the grave.																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.30	BENEFIT:You have a 25%% chance to resist critical hits. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against you, there is a 25%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.
