###Block: Benefit
# Ability					Benefit
CATEGORY=FEAT|Baleful Moan.MOD				BENEFIT:You can emit a moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifier) or become shaken for 1 minute. This is a supernatural, sonic, necromantic, mindaffecting, fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by your moan for 24 hours.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Bolster Resistance.MOD			BENEFIT:Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell gains +4 turn resistance.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Contagious Paralysis.MOD		BENEFIT:Any creature paralyzed by your special attack can confer paralysis to other creatures that touch it. Any creature touching a creature that you have paralyzed is immediately affected as if you had delivered a paralyzing attack upon it (using the same save DC to resist, if allowed). If a creature successfully saves against your contagious paralysis attack, it cant be affected by your attack for 24 hours.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Corpsecrafter.MOD				BENEFIT:Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and +2 hit points per Hit Die.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Corrupted Wild Shape.MOD		BENEFIT:You can use your wild shape ability even though you are undead. The ability functions just as if you were a living creature using the ability, with the following exceptions. You do not gain a Constitution score in the new form, and you retain all the immunities of the undead type while in your new form. The form you assume looks half-decayed, with missing patches of fur and rotted, worm-eaten flesh. While you are in this form, the rank odor of death hangs around you.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Daunting Presence.MOD			BENEFIT:You may take a standard action to awe an opponent. The opponent must be within 30 feet, have line of sight to you, and have an Intelligence score. If the opponent fails a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier), it is shaken for 10 minutes. This feat has no effect on a creature that is already shaken.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Deadly Chill.MOD				BENEFIT:Each corporeal undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with its natural weapons.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Death Master.MOD				BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack against a living foe, the foe is also shaken for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting, fear effect.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Destruction Retribution.MOD		BENEFIT:Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell releases a burst of negative energy upon its destruction, dealing 1d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points per 2 Hit Dice to every creature within a 10-foot spread (Reflex DC 15 half). This damage comes from negative energy, and it therefore heals undead creatures.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Divine Accuracy.MOD			BENEFIT:Spend one of your turn or rebuke attempts to grant all your allies (including yourself) within a 60-foot burst the ability to reroll their miss chance with melee attacks whenever they miss a foe because of a miss chance caused by incorporealness. This effect lasts for 1 minute and can be used once per missed attack.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Empowered Ability Damage.MOD		BENEFIT:All variable, numeric effects of an empowered ability damage or ability drain special attack are increased by 50%%. For example, an allip with this feat drains 1-1/2 times the normal amount of Wisdom (roll 1d4 and multiply the result by 1-1/2).
CATEGORY=FEAT|Empower Turning.MOD			BENEFIT:You can turn or rebuke more undead than usual. After adding your cleric level and Charisma modifier to your turning damage roll, multiply the result by 1-1/2.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Endure Sunlight.MOD			BENEFIT:You can resist all dangerous effects of sunlight for a number of rounds equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). After this time, if you are still exposed to sunlight, you take the normal effects as appropriate for your kind.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Enduring Life.MOD				BENEFIT:Whenever you would gain a negative level, you can ignore the penalties and other ill effects associated with that negative level for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution bonus (if any). For example, if Tordek (Con 15) is struck by a wight, he gains one negative level. However, he can ignore the 1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks associated with that negative level for 2 minutes, since his Constitution bonus is +2. (If Tordek were a spellcaster, he would also avoid losing a spell slot for 2 minutes.) You also gain a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves to remove negative levels.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Energize Spell.MOD			BENEFIT:Your spells are infused with positive energy. An energized spell deals an extra 50%% damage to undead creatures, but deals 50%% less damage to nonundead creatures and to objects. An energized spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spells actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Enervate Spell.MOD			BENEFIT:Your spells are infused with negative energy. An enervated spell deals an extra 50%% damage to living creatures, but deals 50%% less damage to constructs, undead, and objects. An enervated spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spells actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Eviscerator.MOD				BENEFIT:Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack against a living foe, creatures within 30 feet that are allied to that foe are shaken for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting, fear effect.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Fell Animate.MOD				BENEFIT:You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes. Any living creature that could normally be raised as a zombie and that does not possess more than double your Hit Dice, when slain outright by a fell animated spell, rises as a zombie under your control at the beginning of your next action. Even if you kill several creatures with a single fell animated spell, you cant create more Hit Dice of undead than twice your caster level. The standard rules for controlling undead (see animate dead, page 198 of the Players Handbook) apply to newly created undead gained through this metamagic feat. A fell animated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spells actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Fell Drain.MOD				BENEFIT:You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that any living creature that is dealt damage also gains a negative level. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies. Assuming the subject survives, the negative level disappears (without requiring a Fortitude save) after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15). A fell draining spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spells actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Fell Frighten.MOD				BENEFIT:You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that any creature subject to fear effects and mind-affecting spells and abilities that is dealt damage also becomes shaken for 1 minute. A fell frightening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spells actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Fell Weaken.MOD				BENEFIT:You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so that any living creature that is dealt damage also takes a 4 penalty to Strength for 1 minute. Strength penalties from multiple spells enhanced by the Fell Weakening feat do not stack. A fell weakening spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spells actual level.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Ghost Scarred.MOD				BENEFIT:You gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against incorporeal undead. You also gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist the spells or abilities of incorporeal undead
CATEGORY=FEAT|Ghostly Grasp.MOD				BENEFIT:You can wear, wield, and otherwise use corporeal items as though you were not incorporeal.

CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Energy Drain.MOD		BENEFIT:Whenever you bestow a negative level upon a creature, you gain a +1 bonus on skill checks, ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws for 1 hour.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Paralysis.MOD			BENEFIT:When your natural attacks threaten to paralyze your foe, add a +4 bonus to the save DC.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Toughness.MOD			BENEFIT:You gain a number of hit points equal to your current Hit Dice. Each time you gain a Hit Die (such as by gaining a level), you gain 1 additional hit point. If you lose a Hit Die (such as by losing a level), you lose 1 hit point permanently.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Improved Turn Resistance.MOD		BENEFIT:You are less easily affected by clerics or paladins than you normally would be (see Turn or Rebuke Undead, page 159 of the Players Handbook). When resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add +4 to your character level (monster Hit Dice plus class levels) to determine your Hit Dice for turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts. For example, a 4 HD wight with this feat is treated as an 8 HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts, even though it is a 4 HD creature for any other purpose. A vampire that already has +4 turn resistance adds an additional +4 with this feat, for a total of +8.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Lasting Life.MOD				BENEFIT:Once per round as a standard action, you can attempt to remove a negative level from yourself by attempting a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 attackers HD + attackers Cha modifier). If the saving throw succeeds, the negative level goes away. You make a separate saving throw for each negative level you have gained. If the save fails, you retain the negative level, but you can try again next round to remove it.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Life Drain.MOD				BENEFIT:Whenever you bestow a negative level upon a creature, add your Charisma modifier to the hit points lost by the creature due to that negative level. You then gain temporary hit points equal to the amount lost by the creature due to the negative level. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour. For example, a creature touched by a spectre (Cha 15) with this feat loses an additional 2 hit points due to each negative level, and the spectre gains an additional 2 temporary hit points from each negative level it bestows.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Lifebond.MOD				BENEFIT:Whenever the chosen creature is within 60 feet, you gain a +4 bonus to your turn resistance and a +2 bonus on all saving throws. If the chosen creature dies, you lose these bonuses and take a 2 penalty on all saves for 24 hours. If you replace the chosen creature with another living creature, the bond can be transferred at your option.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Lifesense.MOD				BENEFIT:In addition to any normal light that might be present, your surroundings are illuminated by roving points of brightness created by living creatures. To your eyes, a Medium or smaller creature gives off life force sufficient to provide bright illumination in a 60-foot radius, revealing itself and all features and objects in range to your life-adapted sight. This life-light behaves like regular lightyou cant see into solid objects, or past solid walls. A Large creature gives off life-light in a 120-foot radius, and the radius doubles again for each additional size category larger than Medium, up to a maximum radius of 960 feet for a Colossal creature.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Mother Cyst.MOD				BENEFIT:You grow an internal cyst of undead flesh called a mother cyst. The cyst may be noticeable as a discolored swelling on your skin, if desired. The mother cyst is slightly painful, but otherwise isnt harmful. The mother cyst grants you access to a selection of cyst-related spells listed below (and described in Chapter 4 of this book). You cast these spells like any other spell you can cast, once you host a mother cyst (if you are a caster who prepares spells, you can prepare all necrotic cyst spells without referring to a spellbook, as if you had the Spell Mastery feat for each such spell).
CATEGORY=FEAT|Necromantic Might.MOD			BENEFIT:Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of you, they are physically inspired by your necromantic aura, and gain a +2 enhancement bonus on their attack rolls and saving throws.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Necromantic Presence.MOD		BENEFIT:Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of you, they gain a +4 bonus to their turn resistance.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Necrotic Reserve.MOD			BENEFIT:Each day that you slake your hunger by draining or damaging a living creatures ability score, or draining a living creatures life force, you gain a necrotic reserve. On days when you have created a reserve, you are weakened but not destroyed when you are dealt enough damage to reduce your hit points to 0 or lower. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can it take full-round actions). It moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesnt risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) immediately expends the necrotic reserve. Unless the action increased the weakened undeads hit points, it is destroyed. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve is also destroyed if it is dealt additional damage after the attack that first weakened it.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Necropotent.MOD				BENEFIT:You gain a +4 bonus on all damage rolls you make using the selected weapon type against undead.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Nimble Bones.MOD				BENEFIT:Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell gains a +4 bonus on initiative checks and a 10-foot increase to its base land speed.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Positive Energy Resistance.MOD	BENEFIT:You gain resistance 10 against positive energy effects, such as cure spells.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Profane Lifeleech.MOD			BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can spend two of your rebuke attempts to deal 1d6 points of damage to all living creatures within a 30-foot burst. This effect cant reduce any creatures current hit points to less than 0. You are healed of an amount of damage equal to the total amount of hit points that you drain from affected creatures, but this healing does not allow you to exceed your full notmal hit point total.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Profane Vigor.MOD				BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can spend one of your rebuke attempts to heal one undead ally within 60 feet 2 hit points of damage per cleric level. This healing does not allow the affected undead to exceed their full normal hit point totals.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Quicken Manifestation.MOD		BENEFIT:Once per round, you can manifest from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free action. Turning ethereal still requires a standard action.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Quicken Turning.MOD			BENEFIT:You can turn or rebuke undead as a free action. You may still make only one turning attempt per round.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Requiem.MOD					BENEFIT:You can extend the effects of your mind-affecting bardic music and virtuosos performance abilities so that they influence even the undead. All bardic music effects on undead creatures have only half the duration they normally would against the living.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Sacred Vengeance.MOD			BENEFIT:As a free action, spend one of your turn undead attempts to add 2d6 points of damage to all your successful melee attacks against undead until the end of the current round.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Sacred Vitality.MOD			BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can spend one of your turning attempts to gain immunity to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain for 1 minute.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Spell Drain.MOD				BENEFIT:If you bestow a negative level upon a spellcasting creature, and that creature loses a prepared spell, you gain the ability to cast that spell once (as if you had prepared it). Treat the spells effect as if it had been cast by the character who prepared it (including caster level, save DC, and so forth). You need not have the requisite ability score to cast the spell (for instance, you need not have an Intelligence of 13 or higher to cast a fireball drained from the mind of a wizard). The spell remains in your mind for up to 1 hour. You can have a maximum number of stolen spells equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1); any spells that you would gain above this number are simply lost. This feat has no effect on spellcasters who dont prepare spells (such as a sorcerer, who simply loses one spell slot for each negative level bestowed as normal) or who have no spells prepared (such as a fighter, or a wizard who has cast all her spells).
CATEGORY=FEAT|Spurn Death's Touch.MOD			BENEFIT:As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can spend one of your turning attempts for the day to touch an ally to heal 1d4 points of ability damage, remove a paralysis effect, or remove a negative level. You can only use this effect to heal ability damage dealt by an undead creature or remove effects caused by an undead creature.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Stitched Flesh Familiar.MOD		BENEFIT:When choosing a familiar, you may choose a stitched flesh familiar. A stitched flesh familiar appears similar to any of the standard familiars available in the Players Handbook, except that the stitched flesh familiar is obviously sewn together from many different creatures of that kind and, to a practiced eye, is clearly an undead creature. A stitched flesh familiar is magically linked to its master in the same way as a normal familiar. A stitched flesh familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual, except as noted below. Hit Dice: A stitched flesh familiar has a d12 Hit Die and gains no bonus hit points from Constitution (since it is an undead creature). For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the masters character level or the familiars normal Hit Dice total, whichever is higher. Hit Points: Use 1/2 the masters total or the familiars normal total, whichever is higher. Attacks: Use the masters base attack bonus or the familiars, whichever is higher. Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiars base save bonus or the masters (as calculated from his character level), whichever is higher. Familiar Special Abilities: Use the second table in the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Players Handbook to determine additional abilities, just as you would for a normal familiar. Stitched flesh familiars do not grant their masters any of the benefits that appear on the first table in that sidebar. Instead of the noted special ability, a stitched flesh familiar grants its master the ability to control 4 more Hit Dice of undead than he is normally capable of controlling (both through the rebuke undead ability and through spells such as animate dead).
CATEGORY=FEAT|Tomb-Born Fortitude.MOD			BENEFIT:You have a 25%% chance to resist critical hits. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against you, there is a 25%% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. In addition, you do not risk death from massive damage. Your skin takes on the pallor and texture of a dead creature of your race.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Tomb-Born Resilience.MOD		BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, and disease. Your nails or claws grow yellow and rotten. Although this change has no effect on the damage of your unarmed or natural attacks, most individuals find such creatures horrid-looking
CATEGORY=FEAT|Tomb-Born Vitality.MOD			BENEFIT:You do not need to sleep, and you are immune to magic sleep effects. If you are a spellcaster, you still require 8 hours of uninterrupted rest (but not sleep) to prepare your spells. In addition, you no longer need to eat. Your body grows unnaturally thin, your flesh stretching tightly over your bones to give you a freakish, skeletal appearance.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Tomb-Tainted Soul.MOD			BENEFIT:You are healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy as if you were an undead creature. This feat gives no other penalties or benefits of the undead type.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Undead Leadership.MOD			BENEFIT:You attract followers and a cohort as if you had taken the Leadership feat. Your leadership score is treated as 2 higher than it otherwise would be for the purposes of attracting undead followers and treated as 4 lower than it otherwise would be for the purposes of attracting living followers. If you choose to attract an undead cohort rather than a living cohort, you can attract an undead cohort with a maximum effective character level equal to two less than your ECL. See page 106 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for more information on the Leadership feat.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Unquenchable Flame of Life.MOD	BENEFIT:You gain a +2 bonus on all saves against the extraordinary or supernatural abilities of undead creatures.
CATEGORY=FEAT|Vampire Hunter.MOD			BENEFIT:You can take a move action to unfailingly determine whether a vampire or vampire spawn is within 30 feet of you. In addition, you are immune to the dominating gaze ability of vampires and vampire spawn.
