Acererak's Robe	SPROP:Acererak's robe grants the wearer all the abilities normally associated with the robe of the archmagi, regardless of alignment. It also bestows the benefits of death ward (see page 217 of the Player's Handbook) on the wearer. Its most potent ability, however, is its control over life and death. Three times per day, the wearer can cast finger of death with a touch (not at range), as a 20th-level caster (see page 230 of the Player's Handbook). Anyone slain in this manner instantly rises as a zombie, as per the animate dead spell (see pages 198-199 of the Player's Handbook), under the control of the robe's wearer. The wearer can control a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to 4 times his Hit Dice; this is calculated separately from any other ability he might have to control undead. Unfortunately for the wearer, the robe has a will of its own when it comes to slaying and animating others. Anytime the wearer touches another living being, the robe might (10% chance) activate its finger of death ability on its own-even if the wielder has already voluntarily used finger of death three times that day. Further, the robe might (5% chance) cast finger of death at range anytime a living being spends more than 5 minutes within 20 feet of the wearer. Individuals slain under these circumstances also animate as zombies, but they are not under the control of the wearer of the robe. They do not attack him, although they will fight him in self-defense, but they follow him constantly and attack any other living beings they see. Once donned, the robe can only be removed by a miracle or wish. Acererak's robe can only be destroyed if it is fi rst coated in dust taken from a demilich-some legends maintain that it must be from Acererak himself-and then burned in holy fi re, such as that produced by a fl ame strike spell, cast by a 20th-level caster.

Sword (Bastard).COPY=Blade of Valgyr
Blade of Valgyr.MOD	TYPE:Magic.Artifact	EQMOD:Keen.PLUS4W.Unholy.Wounding	SPROP:This chaotic evil intelligent blade (Int 16, Wis 10, Cha 16, Ego 20) is a +4 keen, unholy, wounding bastard sword. It can cast detect magic (see page 219 of the Player's Handbook) at will and darkness (see page 216 of the Player's Handbook) three times per day. It has 10 ranks in Bluff, grants the bearer resistance 10 against fi re and cold, and speaks Common, Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic. The sword is a tainted object and requires the bearer to save against taint each day it remains in her possession. Each day it does not take the life of a lawful good being, the sword bestows a negative level on the wielder. Once the wielder has drawn the sword in battle, she can never draw another weapon, nor get rid of the sword. It appears in her hand at the start of any combat. Only a miracle or wish frees the bearer. Exposure to the breath weapons of two dragon great wyrms-one metallic, one chromatic-within a 24-hour span is required to destroy the Blade of Valgyr.

Mace (Heavy).COPY=Rod of Cas
Rod of Cas.MOD	TYPE:Magic.Artifact	SIZE:L	SPROP: (Ebon Rod of Ill Will) While it usually remains in the possession of Cas, the moose-headed demigod of spite (see page 19), sometimes this minor artifact temporarily finds its way into the hands of mortals. This antler-headed scepter acts as a Large +3 vicious heavy mace that deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage. As soon as an opponent has successfully dealt damage to the wielder, the ebon rod instantly acquires the bane weapon ability, with its power focused on the type of the creature in question. Thus, if a giant dealt even a single point of damage to the rod's wielder, the ebon rod would instantly acquire the giant bane ability for all future attacks at that giant. The weapon remembers all those who have struck its wielder and will instantly shift to whatever type of bane ability is required to match a given attacker. The ebon rod can never be pulled from its wielder's hand without permission (making the wielder immune to attempts to disarm him of the ebon rod), until and unless the wielder's hand is cold and dead. Any enemy of the owner's who picks up the weapon immediately becomes the target of a phantasmal killer spell (DC 20 + owner's Cha modifier). Any attempt to destroy the rod of Cas causes it to teleport instantly to Cas, while the person attempting to destroy it receives all the damage dealt to the ebon rod in its place.
