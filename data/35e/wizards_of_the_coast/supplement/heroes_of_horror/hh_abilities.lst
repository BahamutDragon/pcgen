###Block - Archivist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Archivist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	SORTKEY:1a	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:Archivists are proficient with all simple weapons and with light and medium armor, but not with shields.
Spellcasting			KEY:Archivist ~ Spellcasting				SORTKEY:1b	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:An archivist casts divine spells, drawn primarily from the cleric spell list although he can eventually uncover, learn, and prepare noncleric divine spells spells. Unlike clerics, archivists prepare spells from a prayerbook, a collection of copied divine spells. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, an archivist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an archivist's spell is 10 + the spell level + the archivist's Int modifier. Like other spellcasters, an archivist can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily allotment is given in Table 5-1: The Archivist. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1 on page 8 of the Player's Handbook). He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting a good night's sleep and then spending 1 hour studying his prayerbook. The archivist decides which spells to prepare while studying.
Prayerbook				KEY:Archivist ~ Prayerbook				SORTKEY:1c	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:Unlike a cleric, an archivist does not receive his daily spell complement from whatever deity or cosmic force he worships. Rather, he must seek out and collect new spells much as a wizard does, but from such esoteric sources as holy tablets, ancient steles, or other magical scriptures. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his prayerbook except for read magic, which archivists can prepare from memory. An archivist begins play with a prayerbook containing all 0-level cleric spells plus three 1st-level cleric spells of the player's choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the archivist has, the prayerbook has an additional 1st-level cleric spell. At each new class level, the archivist gains two new cleric spells for his prayerbook; these can be of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new archivist level). At any time, an archivist can also add spells found on scrolls containing divine spells to his prayerbook, but he must make any rolls and spend the time required (see Adding Spells to a Wizard's Spellbook on page 178 of the Player's Handbook). The archivist can learn and thus prepare nonclerical divine spells in this fashion but the two free spells he gains for advancing in class level must be selected from the cleric spell list.
Dark Knowledge			KEY:Archivist ~ Dark Knowledge			SORTKEY:1d0	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:Three times per day, an archivist can draw upon his expansive knowledge of monsters, granting his allies benefits against the creatures they face. Doing this counts as a move action. The secrets of dark knowledge pertain only to aberrations, elementals, magical beasts, outsiders, or undead. An archivist unlocks new dark knowledge abilities as his level increases and can also call upon his dark knowledge more often, gaining one additional daily use for every three archivist levels (4/day at 3rd level, 5/day at 6th level, and so forth). Using dark knowledge requires a Knowledge check of a type appropriate to the creature faced. A Knowledge (arcana) check reveals secrets of magical beasts, Knowledge (dungeoneering) pertains to aberrations, Knowledge (religion) covers undead, and Knowledge (the planes) applies to outsiders and elementals. The DC of the check is 15. Most of the archivist's dark knowledge abilities increase in effectiveness if he succeeds on his Knowledge check by 10 or more. Dark knowledge can only be used once against any given creature. The archivist's dark knowledge can affect a single creature or all creatures of the same race, depending on the effect used. A target creature must be within 60 feet, and the archivist must be aware of the creature's presence, although he need not have a line of sight to it. The effects of dark knowledge last for 1 minute, unless stated otherwise.

Lore Mastery			KEY:Archivist ~ Lore Mastery				SORTKEY:1f	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Upon reaching 2nd level, an archivist gains a +2 bonus to all Decipher Script checks and to all checks of any one Knowledge skill of his choice. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. At 7th, 13th, and 17th level, the archivist can choose an additional Knowledge skill on which to gain the +2 bonus.
Still Mind				KEY:Archivist ~ Still Mind				SORTKEY:1g	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Starting at 4th level, an archivist gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment, due to his rigorous focus and intense mental discipline.
Bonus Feat				KEY:Archivist ~ Bonus Feat				SORTKEY:1h	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:When an archivist reaches 10th level, and again at 20th level, he can select a free feat from the following list: Skill Focus (any Knowledge skill), Spell Focus, any metamagic feat, or any item creation feat.
# Dark Knowledge
Tactics				KEY:Dark Knowledge ~ Tactics				SORTKEY:1d1	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:The archivist knows the general combat behaviors of creatures of that race, granting his allies a +1 bonus to attack rolls made against them. For example, an archivist confronted by corruption eaters* who succeeded on his Knowledge (dungeoneering) check would grant his allies the attack bonus against all the corruption eaters they fought in that encounter. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 10 or more, then this bonus increases to +2. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 20 or more, then this bonus increases to +3. *New monster described on page 144.
Puissance				KEY:Dark Knowledge ~ Puissance			SORTKEY:1d2	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:Starting at 5th level, the archivist can use his dark knowledge to help his allies fight off the corrupting influence of other creatures. Allies within 60 feet of the archivist gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against the affected creature's abilities. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 10 or more, this bonus increases to +2. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 20 or more, this bonus increases to +3.
Foe					KEY:Dark Knowledge ~ Foe				SORTKEY:1d3	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:Starting at 8th level, an archivist can direct his allies to attack vital spots of his enemies. On a successful Knowledge check, he grants them a bonus to weapon damage rolls made against the target creatures equal to 1d6 points of damage. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 10 or more, then this bonus increases to 2d6. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 20 or more, then this bonus increases to 3d6.
Dread Secret			KEY:Dark Knowledge ~ Dread Secret			SORTKEY:1d4	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:By speaking aloud a dread secret of the target creature, an archivist of 11th level or higher can dazzle a target creature for 1 round. Unlike other dark knowledge, this ability can be used only against a single creature. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 10 or more, then the target is dazed for 1 round. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 20 or more, then the target is stunned for 1 round (if the target is immune to being stunned but not immune to being dazed, such as most undead, then the archivist can choose to daze the target instead of stunning it).
Foreknowledge			KEY:Dark Knowledge ~ Foreknowledge			SORTKEY:1d5	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archivist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:Starting at 14th level, an archivist can better prepare his allies for the attacks of the affected creature, making it harder for the creature to land blows and successfully deal damage. Allies within 30 feet of the archivist gain a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class that applies to attacks by the affected creature only. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 10 or more, this bonus increases to +2. If the archivist succeeds on his Knowledge check by 20 or more, this bonus increases to +3.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Dread Necromancer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dread Necromancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A dread necromancer is proficient with all simple weapons and with one martial weapon of her choice. Her choice of martial weapon is made when the character takes her first level of dread necromancer and cannot be changed. Dread necromancers are also proficient with light armor, but not with shields. The somatic components required for dread necromancer spells are simple, so members of this class can cast dread necromancer spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. She still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes. In addition, if a dread necromancer wears medium or heavy armor, or uses a shield, she incurs the same chance of arcane spell failure as any other arcane caster if the spell in question has a somatic component (and most do).

Spellcasting					KEY:Dread Necromancer ~ Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dread Necromancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A dread necromancer casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the dread necromancer's spell list (see page 87). Like a sorcerer, she can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. When a dread necromancer gains access to a new level of spells, she automatically knows all the spells for that level given on the dread necromancer's spell list. Dread necromancers also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below). To cast a spell, a dread necromancer must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a dread necromancer's spell is 10 + the spell's level + her Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a dread necromancer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given in Table 5-2: The Dread Necromancer. In addition, she receives bonus spells for a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1 on page 8 of the Player's Handbook).																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.85
Charnel Touch					KEY:Dread Necromancer ~ Charnel Touch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dread Necromancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality													DESC:Negative energy flows through a dread necromancer's body, concentrating in her hands. At will, but no more than once per round, she can make a melee touch attack against a living foe that deals 1d8 points of damage, +1 per four class levels. This touch heals undead creatures, restoring 1 hit point per touch, +1 per four class levels. A dread necromancer can use the spectral hand spell to deliver this attack from a distance.

The first symptom is her body's increased resilience to physical harm. She gains DR 2/ bludgeoning and magic. As the dread necromancer increases in level, this DR increases in effectiveness, to DR 4 at 7th level, DR 6 at 11th level, and DR 8 at 15th level.

This burst deals 1d4 points of damage per class level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + Cha modifier) reduces damage by half. Undead creatures within this burst are healed the same amount of hit points as the damage she deals to living creatures. A dread necromancer can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one additional time per day for every five levels she attains beyond 3rd (2/day at 8th level, 3/day at 13th level, and 4/day at 18th level).

Advanced Learning					KEY:Dread Necromancer ~ Advanced Learning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Dread Necromancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality													DESC:At 4th level, a dread necromancer can add a new spell to her list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a cleric or wizard spell of the necromancy school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the dread necromancer already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is added to that dread necromancer's spell list and can be cast just like any other spell she knows. If a spell is both a cleric spell and a wizard spell, use the lower of the two spell levels (when different) to determine what level the spell is for a dread necromancer. A dread necromancer gains an additional new spell at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.

Enemies in the area must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier) or become shaken. A creature who successfully saves cannot be affected by that dread necromancer's fear aura for 24 hours.

Scabrous Touch					KEY:Dread Necromancer ~ Scabrous Touch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dread Necromancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DEFINE:ScabrousTouchTimes|0		DESC:Starting at 6th level, once per day a dread necromancer can use her charnel touch to inflict disease on a creature she touches. This ability works like the contagion spell (see page 213 of the Player's Handbook), inflicting the disease of her choice immediately, with no incubation period, unless the target makes a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier). The DC for subsequent saving throws to resist the effects of the disease depends on the disease inflicted; see page 292 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details. Activating this class feature is a swift action. The effect lasts until the dread necromancer makes a successful charnel touch attack. The spectral hand spell enables a dread necromancer to deliver a scabrous touch attack from a distance. A dread necromancer can use this ability once per day at 6th level, twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 16th level.

The familiar she acquires is more powerful than a standard wizard's or sorcerer's familiar, but it is unequivocally evil. The player of a dread necromancer character chooses one of the following creatures: imp (devil), quasit (demon), vargouille, or ghostly visage. All these creatures are described in the Monster Manual except for the ghostly visage, an undead symbiont described on page 221 of the Fiend Folio. A dread necromancer's familiar gains the usual familiar benefits given on pages 52-53 of the Player's Handbook, with two exceptions. Its type does not change, and it does not gain the exceptional ability to speak with other creatures of its kind. A dread necromancer's familiar can use its ability to deliver touch spells such as its master's charnel touch, scabrous touch, or enervating touch attack. The master must use a standard action to imbue the touch attack into her familiar.

In addition, when a dread necromancer uses the animate dead spell to create undead, she can control 4 + her Charisma bonus HD worth of undead creatures per class level (rather than the 4 HD per level normally granted by the spell). Similarly, when a dread necromancer casts the control undead spell, the spell targets up to (2 + her Cha bonus) HD/level of undead creatures, rather than the 2 HD/level normally granted by the spell.

Each day, she can bestow a total number of negative levels equal to one-half her class level, but no more than two negative levels with a single touch. The saving throw to remove the negative levels has a DC of 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Charisma modifier. Activating this class feature is a swift action. The effect lasts until she makes a successful charnel touch attack. A dread necromancer can use the spectral hand spell to deliver this attack from a distance.

This face looks corporeal and fleshy, but it is actually the visage's incorporeal form. When manifesting a visage, the ghostly visage is susceptible to attacks separate from its host. Attacks that miss the visage because of its incorporeal nature (including attacks from nonmagic weapons as well as attacks that are foiled by the 50%% chance to ignore damage) target the host instead. For attacks that require attack rolls, if the attack roll exceeds the AC of the host, the host takes damage instead of the visage.

###Block - Corrupt Avenger
Spellcasting	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:You have the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a corrupt avenger spell, you must have a corruption score equal to or greater than the spell's level. Bonus spells are based on a number equal to 10 + your corruption score, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Charisma modifi er. When you get 0 spells per day of a given level, you gain only any bonus spells you would be entitled to based on your corruption score. You prepare and cast spells just as a wizard does; your spell list appears below. You can also prepare and cast corrupt spells (see page 125). You record your corrupt avenger spells in a spellbook, just as a wizard does. At 1st level, your spellbook contains two 1st-level spells of your choice, selected from the corrupt avenger spell list on page 90. At each new corrupt avenger level, you gain two new spells of any spell level or levels that you can cast (based on your new corrupt avenger level) for your spellbook. At any time, you can also add spells found in other corrupt avengers' spellbooks to your own, and you can also add spells from another character's spellbook (such as a wizard's or a wu jen's book) to your own as long as those spells appear on your class spell list.
Armored Casting	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Armored Casting	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:Because the somatic components required for corrupt avenger spells are simple, you can cast corrupt avenger spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, wearing medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, imposes the normal chance of spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). Wearing even light armor still imposes the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes.
Detect Sworn Foe	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Detect Sworn Foe	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:You have the spell-like ability to detect the presence of your sworn foe. This ability is similar to the detect evil spell (see page 218 of the Player's Handbook) in range, area, and duration. In the first round of concentration, you can ascertain the presence of a sworn foe within the area. In the second round, you can determine the number of foes in the area and the power of the strongest one (as per the detect evil spell). In the third round, you can determine the strength and location of each foe.
Sworn Foe		KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Sworn Foe		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:At 1st level, you must choose a specifi c kind of monster or an organization as your sworn foe. This cannot be a broad category such as aberrations but must be a single creature type, like bugbears. You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks relating to your sworn foe. This bonus increases to +4 at 4th level, to +6 at 7th level, and to +8 at 10th level. Unlike a ranger's attack against a favored enemy, you do not gain a bonus on damage rolls against your sworn foe. Instead, whenever you face your sworn foe in combat, you enter a ragelike fury. You gain a +2 bonus to your Strength and Constitution scores. This fury lasts for a number of rounds equal to your corruption score, or until none of your sworn foes remain within sight (or within 60 feet if they are invisible or otherwise hidden from your sight). At the conclusion of your fury, you must make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 15 + 1 per round that you were in your frenzy. If you fail this save, your corruption score increases by 1.
Taint Suppression	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Taint Suppression	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:While you are likely to accumulate high corruption and depravity scores over the course of your career, this taint is not immediately obvious to onlookers. Your depravity manifests in the normal range of mental symptoms, but you can replace any physical symptom of corruption with the internal corruption symptom. If you enter a tainted area, your corruption immediately manifests externally, and you regain the physical symptoms you exchanged for internal corruption. These physical symptoms disappear 1d4 days after you leave a tainted area. It is otherwise impossible to tell, based on your external appearance, that you carry corruption.
Tainted Strike	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Tainted Strike	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can infuse a melee attack with the power of your taint, adding 1/2 your class level to the damage you deal with the attack. If you strike a creature immune to the effects of taint (such as an undead creature or a creature with the evil subtype), the tainted strike has no effect. You can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 6th level, and three times per day at 10th level.
Grim Resolve	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Grim Resolve		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws. This benefi t does not stack with other effects that allow you to add your Charisma bonus to saves (such as divine grace).
Frightful Fury	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Frightful Fury	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, when you face your sworn foe and enter your fury, all opponents within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + your corrupt avenger level + your Cha modifi er) or become shaken, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
Unnerving Fury	KEY:Corrupt Avenger ~ Unnerving Fury	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Corrupt Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.89	DESC:When you reach 9th level, your fury becomes even more fearsome. Opponents within 30 feet of you who fail a Will save (DC 10 + your corrupt avenger level + your Cha modifi er) become unnerved, taking a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.


###Block - Death Delver
Spellcasting		KEY:Death Delver ~ Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:As a death delver, you have the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, you must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level. Death delver bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against your spells have a DC of 10 + spell's level + your Wisdom modifi er. When you get 0 spells per day of a given level, you gain only the bonus spells you would be entitled to based upon your Wisdom score. The death delver spell list appears on page 94. You have access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare. You prepare and cast spells just like a cleric does. Death delvers must spend 1 hour each night in the contemplation of death to regain their daily allotments of spells. Time spent resting has no impact on whether death delvers can prepare spells.
Deathsense			KEY:Death Delver ~ Deathsense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:You have the infallible ability to detect the presence and condition of nearby life. This ability functions as the spell deathwatch (see page 217 of the Player's Handbook) but can be invoked at will, with no cost, as a swift action.
Rebuke Undead		KEY:Death Delver ~ Rebuke Undead			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:Like an evil cleric, you can rebuke undead. Use your death delver level as the cleric level for determining success and damage. You can do this a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifi er and can take the Extra Turning feat to gain additional turn attempts. If you already have the ability to rebuke undead from a previous class, death delver levels stack with those class levels for the purposes of rebuking undead.
Deadened Soul		KEY:Death Delver ~ Deadened Soul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Upon reaching 2nd level, your understanding of death has progressed to the point where you no longer fear it, nor anything else. You are immune to fear effects of any kind.
Spontaneous Casting	KEY:Death Delver ~ Spontaneous Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:By 2nd level, your familiarity with the ebb and fl ow of death has blossomed to the point that, like a cleric, you can lose any prepared spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same level or lower. An evil death delver can only spontaneously convert prepared spells into infl ict spells of equal level or lower. Neutral death delvers must choose whether they will cast spontaneous cure or infl ict spells and can never change their selection once the choice has been made.
Death Ward			KEY:Death Delver ~ Death Ward				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:At 3rd level, you gain the ability to mystically protect yourself or another from the depredations of death magic and life-draining attacks. This supernatural ability functions exactly like the spell death ward (see page 217 of the Player's Handbook), save that the duration is 1 hour per death delver level. Using this ability is a standard action. You gain an additional use of this ability per day upon reaching 6th level, and again at 9th level.
Diehard			KEY:Death Delver ~ Diehard				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Death delvers of at least 4th level gain the benefi t of the Diehard feat (see page 93 of the Player's Handbook), even if they do not meet the prerequisites.
Fear Aura			KEY:Death Delver ~ Fear Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Starting at 5th level, once per day you can emanate a nearly palpable aura of fear in a 30-foot radius. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level. Enemies (not allies) within the area must make a Will save (DC 10 + class level + your Cha modifi er) or be affected as if by a fear spell (see page 229 of the Player's Handbook).
Cheat Death			KEY:Death Delver ~ Cheat Death			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Upon reaching 7th level, your mastery over death and dying has progressed to the point where you can deny a foe the ability to send you into death's embrace in a single, cowardly blow. Whenever anyone attempts a coup de grace on you, you automatically make the subsequent Fortitude save (see pages 153-154 of the Player's Handbook). The attacker still deals just as much damage as she normally would, and you could still die from that damage. Similarly, when you take massive damage (50 or more points of damage from a single attack), you automatically succeed on the Fortitude save to survive the associated trauma (see page 145 of the Player's Handbook), although you can be killed by sheer damage dealt.
Mantle of Life		KEY:Death Delver ~ Mantle of Life			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, you gain the ability to project your own wisdom and confi dence into your allies. As a full-round action, you can send a surge of vitality through all companions within 60 feet. This surge grants every ally in the area (including yourself) a +4 bonus on Will saves for 1 minute per class level.
Nine Lives			KEY:Death Delver ~ Nine Lives				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Death Delver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:The pinnacle of achievement for a death delver is the remarkable ability to step back through death's door when forcibly pushed through it. Upon reaching 10th level, you gain the ability to cheat death nine times-in effect, gaining nine bonus lives. Every time a single attack, spell, or effect would drop you below -10 hit points or otherwise kill you, you lose one of your nine lives in lieu of taking the effects of whatever would have killed you; instead you drop to -9 hit points but are stable. Continuing sources of damage, such as being dropped into lava or held under water, will of course burn through a character's nine lives in no time. Keep track of how many lives you've used, because once they're gone, they're gone. For example, consider a death delver with seven lives and 11 hit points remaining who is struck by a critical hit that deals 32 points of damage. Since dropping to -21 hit points would kill him, he automatically loses one of his remaining bonus lives instead and stabilizes at -9 hit points, leaving him with six lives remaining. Later in the adventure, after he has been fully healed, a dread witch hits him with a disintegrate spell, which would normally reduce him to a pile of dust. He is once again reduced to -9 hit points and marks off another life (leaving fi ve bonus lives remaining). He's not having a very good week, but at least he's still around to complain about it.

###Block - Dread Witch
Spellcasting			KEY:Dread Witch ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:At every dread witch level except 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class you belonged to before you added the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other class benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a dread witch, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day.
Master of Terror			KEY:Dread Witch ~ Master of Terror				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:Your fear-based spells become more potent. The save DC of any spell you cast with the fear descriptor increases by 1. This bonus stacks with Spell Focus. Furthermore, add the spells bane and doom to your arcane spellcaster list as 2nd-level spells. In addition, you become adept at making people uneasy with the right word, expression, or gesture. You gain a bonus to all Intimidate skill checks equal to +2 per class level.
Unnatural Will			KEY:Dread Witch ~ Unnatural Will				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:You gain Unnatural Will (see page 124) as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites.
Absorb Fear				KEY:Dread Witch ~ Absorb Fear					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can turn your own fear, whether natural or mystical in origin, into extra power for your spells. (See Dread on page 59 for more on nonmagical fear.) Any time you are exposed to a condition that could make you shaken, all your spells function at +1 caster level; if the condition could make you frightened, they function at +2 caster level; if panicked, they function at +3 caster level. These bonuses last for the duration of the fear effect, or for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifi er, whichever is less. (Of course, if you fail your saving throw against the condition, you might not be in a position to use the bonuses, but you do have them.) These bonuses are treated in all ways as though you had failed the save. In other words, if you are subject to a spell that causes panic on a failed save but only frightens those who make the save, you gain the bonus from being panicked even if you make the save. You can, instead of gaining these bonuses, choose to cast a single extra spell; this casting does not use up a spell slot. You must make this choice the instant you are subject to the fear effect, and once you have made your choice you must cast the spell within a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifi er. You can cast an additional cantrip if shaken, an additional 1st-level spell if frightened, or an additional 2ndlevel spell if panicked. If you are subject to a second fear effect while still enjoying the effects of the first-either the granted benefits or holding the extra spell-you must decide whether to keep the original effect or replace it with the new one; you cannot benefit from more than one fear effect at a time.
Fearful Empowerment		KEY:Dread Witch ~ Fearful Empowerment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, once per day you can add the fear descriptor to any spell you cast that has some sort of visual manifestation. For example, you could apply it to a fi reball, to a summon monster spell, or to any visual illusion, but not to charm person, since that spell does not directly create any visual effect. Creatures targeted by a spell modified by fearful empowerment must make a Will save (DC equal to 10 + your class level + your Cha modifier) or become shaken for 1d4 rounds; this is in addition to any other effects the spell might have. Your save DC bonuses from master of terror apply to this spell. At 5th level, you can invoke this power twice per day.
Delay Fear				KEY:Dread Witch ~ Delay Fear					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:Starting at 4th level, you can choose to delay the onset of any fear effect you impose on someone else, such as by casting a cause fear spell. You can delay the onset up to a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifi er. You must determine the onset time when casting the spell, and you cannot later change your mind. Similarly, you can delay fear effects affecting you. If you fail your save against a fear effect, you can delay its onset for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. You still gain the advantages granted by the absorb fear class feature, even though you are delaying the negative effects. You can invoke this version of delay fear twice per day.
Greater Master of Terror	KEY:Dread Witch ~ Greater Master of Terror		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, the increased difficulty of all save DCs against all spells you cast with the fear descriptor increases from +1 to +2. In addition, your fear spells are now so potent that they can even affect individuals normally immune to fear, such as paladins, although the subject still gains a saving throw to resist the spell's effect. Only a target whose HD exceed your caster level by 4 or more is immune to your mastery of terror. For instance, if you are a sorcerer 7/dread witch 4 (overall caster level 10), a paladin of 14th level or higher is immune to your fear spells.
Horrifi c Aura			KEY:Dread Witch ~ Horrific Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:At 5th level, you radiate an aura of terror. Creatures with 6 or fewer HD must succeed in a Will save (DC equal to 10 + your class level + your Cha modifi er) or remain shaken as long as they are within 10 feet of you. A creature who successfully saves is immune to your horrifi c aura for 24 hours. Creatures of greater than 6 HD are unaffected. Once per day per point of Charisma modifi er, you can channel this aura into a potent touch attack. Creatures struck by this horrifi c touch attack who fail their Will save (see above) are panicked for 1d4+1 rounds; creatures who succeed on their save are shaken for 1 round. This touch attack, unlike the standard aura, functions against creatures of any HD and can even affect individuals normally immune to fear.
Refl ective Fear			KEY:Dread Witch ~ Refl ective Fear				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Dread Witch Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.99	DESC:At 5th level, any fear effect against which you successfully save is immediately targeted back at the source. You still gain the benefits of absorb fear. If the source of the fear effect fails its save, everyone else who might have been subject to the fear effect (such as your companions) immediately gains a second saving throw to shake off the effects, as they observe the object of their fear itself grow terrifi ed.

###Block - Fiend-Blooded
Spellcasting		KEY:Fiend-Blooded ~ Spellcasting			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fiend-Blooded Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At each new fiend-blooded level except for 10th, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adopting the prestige class. You do not gain any other class benefit a member of that class would normally gain, except that your fiend-blooded levels also stack with any other arcane spellcaster levels for the purpose of determining familiar abilities. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a fiend-blooded, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Fiendish Companion	KEY:Fiend-Blooded ~ Fiendish Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fiend-Blooded Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:Your familiar benefi ts from your fi endish heritage. The fi endish template (described on page 108 of the Monster Manual) can be applied to your familiar, if you so desire. Since this is not possession but rather a sympathetic link, the familiar's alignment need not shift to evil.
Fiendish Heritage		KEY:Fiend-Blooded ~ Fiendish Heritage		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fiend-Blooded Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:You draw strength from your fi endish ancestor's essence as you gain increased mastery over your lineage. At 1st level, a subtle toughening of your physical form grants you a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. At 3rd level, you gain a +1 boost to your Charisma score. At 5th level, you gain a +1 boost to your Intelligence score. At 7th level, you gain a +1 boost to your Dexterity score. At 9th level, you gain a +1 boost to your Constitution score.
Fiendish Sorcery		KEY:Fiend-Blooded ~ Fiendish Sorcery		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fiend-Blooded Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:You gain insight into the power of your fiendish heritage, and this insight strengthens your spellcasting prowess. At 2nd level, and again at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, add one additional spell to your spells known list. Each new spell must be of a level that you can cast but can be any spell having the fi re descriptor or any spell from the schools of enchantment, illusion, or necromancy. Thus, you could add fi reball (a fi re spell) or speak with dead (a necromancy spell) to your 3rd-level spells known (even though you are an arcane caster and speak with dead is normally a divine spell), but not lightning bolt (which neither carries the fi re descriptor nor belongs to one of the three specifi ed schools).
Blood of Fiends		KEY:Fiend-Blooded ~ Blood of Fiends			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fiend-Blooded Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:Upon reaching 3rd level, you gain a +1 bonus on saves against poison. You also reduce any damage taken from poison (whether hit point or ability damage) by 1 point. Starting at 6th level, your fiendish essence grants you resistance to cold and fi re 5. Upon reaching 9th level, you have unlocked much of the power of your fi endish lineage, gaining resistance to acid and electricity 5.
Smiting Spell		KEY:Fiend-Blooded ~ Smiting Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fiend-Blooded Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:If you are a fi end-blooded of at least 4th level, you can as a free action, once per day, invest a portion of your fi endish power into any damaging spell you cast. The resulting spell will deal an additional number of hit points of damage equal to your fi end-blooded class level + Charisma modifi er to all within the spell's area. Starting at 8th level, you can use smiting spell twice per day.
Fiendish Exaltation	KEY:Fiend-Blooded ~ Fiendish Exaltation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Fiend-Blooded Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:At 10th level, you unlock the final secrets buried within your lineage. In addition to the ability boosts you gained from your fiendish heritage, you now gain an additional +1 to Dexterity, Constitution, and Intelligence, and +2 to Strength. You also gain complete immunity to poison, and damage reduction 10/magic.

###Block - Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine
Tainted Creatures	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Tainted Creatures	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:For purposes of your special abilities, a tainted creature includes any creature with a corruption or depravity score of 1 or more, any creature with a tainted feat, and any creature that has the ability to bestow corruption or depravity on another creature.
Spellcasting	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:At every odd-numbered level, you gain new spell levels and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class you belonged to before you added the prestige class. You do not, however, gain any other class benefit a character of that class would have gained. Determine spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before you became a purifi er of the Hallowed Doctrine, you must decide to which class to add each level of purifi er for the purpose of determining spells per day.
Aura of Purity	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Aura of Purity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You radiate an aura of holiness, making it diffi cult for you to hide your true nature. Tainted creatures need only succeed on a Spot check (DC 20 minus your purifi er class level) to recognize you for what you are (or at least as a threat).
Detect Taint	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Detect Taint		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:At will, you can use detect taint (see page 128 for spell description).
Turn Undead		KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Turn Undead		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:Your purifi er class levels stack with any cleric or paladin levels you might have for purposes of turning undead.
Lay on Hands	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Lay on Hands		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can lay on hands as a paladin of your class level (see page 44 of the Player's Handbook). If you also have paladin levels, these levels stack.
Smite Taint		KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Smite Taint		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you can smite tainted creatures as a paladin smites evil (see page 44 of the Player's Handbook). If you have another smite ability, such as a paladin's ability to smite evil, you can choose as need dictates to use that power to smite taint instead of the power's original target. You gain additional uses of this power at higher levels (2/day at 6th level and 3/day at 9th level).
Aura of Sanctity	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Aura of Sanctity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:Starting at 4th level, all allies within 10 feet of you gain a +2 sacred bonus on saves made to resist acquiring taint. This bonus rises to +4 when you reach 10th level.
Turn Tainted	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Turn Tainted		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:At 5th level, you can turn any tainted creature as though it were an undead equal to the creature's HD +4.
Purify Soul		KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Purify Soul		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:Beginning at 6th level, you can cure a living being of 1 point of corruption or depravity by touching that individual and spending a use of your turn undead ability. Unwilling creatures can attempt saving throws to resist: This is a Fortitude save if you are trying to cure them of corruption and a Will save if you are trying to cure them of depravity. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your purifier class level + your Charisma modifier. This ability cannot remove so much corruption or depravity that it would move the target creature down to a lower taint category. Creatures who are innately tainted (that is, creatures whose monster entries in this or another book describe them as possessing corruption or depravity scores, tainted feats, or the ability to bestow taint) are unaffected. At 8th level, your purifying touch improves and henceforward cures 2 points of corruption or depravity per touch; at 10th level this improves still further to cure 3 points per touch.
Cleansing Flame	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Cleansing Flame	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:Starting at 7th level, three times per day you can cast any offensive spell against a tainted creature as though it were maximized (as per the metamagic feat), without preparing in advance to do so and without increasing the effective spell slot of the spell. The spell functions as maximized only against tainted creatures; against any other creature in its area it functions normally.
Shield of Purity	KEY:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine ~ Shield of Purity	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Purifier Of The Hallowed Doctrine Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.109	DESC:At 8th level, you can surround yourself and your companions with a shield of holy energy. This effect covers up to a 10-foot radius around you. Any creature with even a single point of taint cannot enter this area, and all within gain a +6 sacred bonus on saves against spells or magical attacks made by tainted creatures from a distance. This effect requires you to spend a use of your turn undead ability to activate and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

###Block - Tainted Scholar
Spellcasting		KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you belonged to more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a tainted scholar, you must choose to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Blood Component		KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Blood Component			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You can substitute a drop of your own blood for a spell's material component (if any), and in so doing increase the spell's power. The pinprick or minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action (just like using a material component) that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of damage to the tainted scholar but raises the spell's caster level by 1. Damage reduction, if you have any, doesn't apply to this damage. If a spell has a costly material component (greater than 1 gp), you must still provide it but can use this ability to enhance the spell if you desire. You can similarly enhance a spell that has no material component.
Level Advancement		KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Level Advancement			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:The power of taint is seductive. Once you have tasted its attractions, it is hard to resist. If you wish to advance a level in another class after taking your fi rst level as a tainted scholar, you must succeed on a Will save (DC = 10 + your depravity score). If you fail, you must stay in this prestige class and advance another level in tainted scholar instead. If you succeed, you can advance the level in another class, although you must still attempt the saving throw the next time you gain a level or default back to this prestige class. Once you reach 10th level as a tainted scholar, you can freely advance in other classes.
Tainted Spellcasting	KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Tainted Spellcasting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:Rather than using a key ability score for spellcasting, you use your corruption and depravity scores. To cast a spell, you must have a depravity score at least equal to the spell's level. Your bonus spells are based on a number equal to your depravity score + 10, and saving throws against your spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + 1/2 your corruption score. For example, a tainted scholar with a depravity score of 3 would gain bonus spells as a wizard with an Intelligence score of 13 or a sorcerer with a Charisma score of 13. You accumulate taint for casting your spells. Each time you cast an arcane spell, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + spell level) or increase your depravity score by 1. All arcane spells you cast are evil spells.
Taint Suppression		KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Taint Suppression			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:You are likely to accumulate high corruption and depravity scores, but this taint is not immediately obvious to onlookers. Your depravity manifests in the normal range of mental symptoms, but you can replace any physical symptom of corruption with the internal corruption symptom. If you enter a tainted area, your corruption immediately manifests externally again, and you regain the physical symptoms you exchanged for internal corruption, if any. These physical symptoms disappear again 1d4 days after you leave a tainted area. Otherwise, it is impossible to tell from external appearance that you carry corruption.
Secret			KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Secret					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:In your studies, you unearth all sorts of useful forbidden knowledge. At 2nd level, and again at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, choose a secret from the table below. Your class level plus your depravity score determines which secrets you can choose: The table shows the minimum requirement for each secret. You can't choose the same secret twice. The details of each secret are given after the table.
Lore				KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Lore					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	DESC:Tainted scholars gather knowledge. At 3rd level, you gain the ability to know legends or information regarding various topics, just as a bard can with bardic knowledge. You add your tainted scholar class level and your Intelligence modifier to this lore check. You can add your depravity score instead of your Intelligence modifier to any lore check dealing with supernatural, horrific, tainted, or otherwise forbidden subjects, at the DM's discretion. See page 28 of the Player's Handbook for more information on bardic knowledge.
Outre Lore			KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Outre Lore				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, your knowledge of lore beyond the realm of common experience is broadened and magically augmented. Once per day, you can use contact other plane (see pages 212-213 of the Player's Handbook) as a spell-like ability. If your Intelligence and Charisma temporarily decrease as a result of using this ability, you must make a Will save or have your depravity score increased by 1. The DC for this Will save equals the DC of the Intelligence check to avoid the ability score decrease +10. Thus, if you contact an Elemental Plane (spell DC 7), the DC is 17; if you contact a greater deity on an Outer Plane (spell DC 16), the DC is 26.
Aberrant Lore		KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Aberrant Lore				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	DESC:At 7th level, you gain an innate understanding of objects, places, and creatures that carry the taint of evil. By concentrating as a full-round action and focusing your attention on a creature, object, or specific site within 60 feet of you, you can determine if it carries or transmits taint. In the case of a creature, you can determine the strength of its higher taint score (corruption or depravity): mild, moderate, or severe (see pages 62-66). In the case of an object, by spending a full hour examining it you can determine its magic properties as if you had cast an identify spell on it (see page 243 of the Player's Handbook). In the case of a location, you can determine its magical properties, if it has any, in the same way as with an object. If it has no magical properties but is tainted by some horrific event in the past, you receive a vision of the event. Examining a location requires you to spend 1 hour in the location.
Heretical Lore		KEY:Tainted Scholar ~ Heretical Lore			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tainted Scholar Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	DESC:Beginning at 9th level, you gain contacts among the evil creatures of the planes. These beings can rescue you from extreme situations or otherwise grant your wishes. As often as once per day, you can call upon these entities to grant you a limited wish (see page 248 of the Player's Handbook), with no XP cost attached. However, using this ability increases your corruption and depravity scores by 1d3 points each, and results in the imposition of a geas/quest (see page 234 of the Player's Handbook) that requires you to perform some evil act in repayment for the favor.

# Secret
Blooded Metamagic			KEY:Secret ~ Blooded Metamagic			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Secret.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.115	DESC:This secret allows you to apply a metamagic feat you know to a spell you cast by paying an additional cost in blood. By draining your own blood, you can enhance your spells without using a higher-level spell slot. The cost is a number of points of Constitution damage equal to the spell slot adjustment of the metamagic feat. Thus, casting an empowered vampiric touch spell costs you 2 points of Constitution damage, because an empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than normal. You cannot enhance a spell to a level higher than you can cast. For example, you must be at least a 9th-level caster to cast an empowered vampiric touch spell (or at least 10th-level, if you are casting as a sorcerer), since the empowered spell would require a 5th-level spell slot. If you do not have a Constitution score, you cannot use this ability.

Bloodseeking Spell		KEY:Secret ~ Bloodseeking Spell			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Secret.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	DESC:This secret grants you the ability to imbue your spells with the ability to draw blood from their targets. To use this ability, you must infl ict a minor wound on yourself; this is a free action that deals 3 points of damage to you and becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Damage reduction, if you have any, doesn't apply to this damage. A bloodseeking spell deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to each target that takes damage from the spell. You can't apply this ability to any spell that doesn't deal damage. This extra damage applies only to spells that deal hit point damage, not to spells that deal ability damage, ability drain, or other kinds of damage. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune.
