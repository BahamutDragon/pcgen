SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:If you deal a creature enough damage to make it fall (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it) with your mind blade, you drain off a portion of the creature's liberated energy of consciousness.

Mind Empowerment										CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																				PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Mind blade class feature, psychic strike class feature, Mind Cleave*.						DESC:When you lay low a foe, you drain off a portion of its excess mental energy into the conduit of your mind blade.																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.56	BENEFIT:If you deal a creature enough damage to make it fall (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it) with your mind blade, you capture a greater portion of the creature's liberated energy of consciousness (more than you already drain with your Mind Cleave feat). The additional liberated energy resides in your blade for 3 rounds or until you make your next successful psychic strike (whichever occurs first), whereupon you deal an additional 1d8 points of damage.
Mind Strike, Focused			KEY:Mind Strike (Focused)		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																				PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to generate a mind blade, psychic strike +1d8.

DESC:Choose a manifesting class that you possess. The powers you manifest from that class are more powerful.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:Your manifester level for the chosen manifesting class increases by four. This benefit can't increase your manifester level higher than your Hit Dice. Even if you cant benefit from the full bonus immediately, however, if you later gain levels of nonmanifesting classes, you might be able to apply the rest of the bonus. For example, a human 5th-level psion/3rd-level fighter who selects this feat would increase his psion manifester level from 5th to 8th (since he has 8 Hit Dice). If he later gained a fighter level, he would gain the remainder of the bonus, and his psion manifester level would become 9th (since he now has 9 Hit Dice). A character with, two or more manifesting classes (such as a psychic warrior/psion) must choose which class gains the feats effect. This feat does not affect your powers per day or powers known. It only increases your manifester level, which helps you overcome power resistance and increases the duration and other effects of your powers. Special: You can select this feat multiple times.

DESC:You can wear an astral construct as if it were a second skin.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.57	BENEFIT:If you expend your psionic focus, you can fuse the essence of an astral construct that you have personally manifested with your own body. You choose to do this when you first manifest the power to gain this effect (instead of creating an astral construct normally). This construct, once absorbed into your body, does not count against your limit of astral constructs crafted, in most cases you can have only one astral construct active at a time. This additional astral "flesh" bonds perfectly with your own, giving you a silvery-white appearance and 1d8 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour. More important, it grants you one Menu A choice (EPH 186) that you can use as if you were the construct. You wear the skin of the construct for the normal duration of the manifested astral construct power, after which time it elapses. Special: If you have any other feats that modify the appearance or abilities of an astral construct (such as Boost Construct or Ectopic Form), you do not accrue those benefits when you use the astral construct power with Skin of the Construct.

Volatile Escalation									CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Psionic																																				PRETEXT:Volatile mind class feature.															DESC:When you are attacked with a telepathic power, your innate wildness forces a higher mental price on your attacker.																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:While you are psionically focused and have not consciously lowered your volatile mind ability, the number of power points it costs a manifester to affect you is higher. A manifester who uses a telepathic power upon you while these conditions apply must pay an additional 1d4 power points on top of his normal cost. This effect stacks with that of the volatile mind class feature.

SOURCEPAGE:p.58	BENEFIT:While you are psionically focused and have not consciously lowered your volatile mind ability, you absorb extra power points that manifesters of telepathic powers are forced to pay when they target you.

Knockdown Power		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																					DESC:You can manifest powers that knock creatures off their feet.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Knockdown Power knocks any creature caught in its area prone if the target fails its saving throw to avoid any or all of the damage of the power. It can only be applied to powers that allow Reflex saves and affect an area (a cone, line, burst, and so on). Powers that do not allow saving throws gain no advantage if they are made into knockdown powers. Creatures with evasion are knocked prone if they fail their Reflex saves (creatures with improved evasion are not knocked down if they fail their saves). Flying creatures affected by a knockdown power that fail their saving throws are forced down 10 feet. For example, if a creature makes its saving throw against a knockdown energy cone but still takes half damage, it is not knocked prone. If it fails its save and takes full damage, it is knocked prone. Using this feat increases the power point cost by the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Linked Power		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																					DESC:You can link a power to the power you manifest in this round so that it goes off next round.											SOURCEPAGE:p.62	BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Manifesting a power altered by this feat means that you must choose two powers one you intend to manifest in this round, and one you intend to manifest in the next round. The power that is manifested in this round is not altered in any way, nor is the linked power that goes off in the next round however, you do not need to spend any of your actions or power points next round to manifest the linked power. The linked power is automatically targeted on the same area or target as the power you manifest in this round (if the power you manifest this round has no area or target, choose an area or target in this round for the linked power to affect in the next round). If the same creature is targeted by both powers, the target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a psionic charm followed by a linked psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect). It is possible that by the time the linked power comes into effect on the following round, the area where it goes off or the target that it affects no longer has relevance. On the other hand, you are free on the subsequent round to take actions normally. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power manifested this round by a number equal to the power point cost of the linked power. Thus if you manifest energy stun (3 power points) and energy burst (5 power points) as the linked power, the metapsionic cost is 8. The total of power points you spend in this manner cannot exceed your manifester level.
Metapower			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic						PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to manifest psionic powers, any other metapsionic feat.	DESC:You can permanently modify a psionic power you know with a metapsionic feat.														SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:You choose one power known to you to become permanently modified by one metapsionic feat you know. The cost of modifying your chosen power with metapsionic feats is reduced by 2 power points (to a minimum extra cost of 0 power points). When you manifest the modified power with that metapsionic feat, you must still obey any restrictions of that feat (for example, expending your psionic focus). Once a metapower is created by taking this feat, it cannot be changed. The metapower can be used normally with other metapsionic feats you know. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you choose a power either one you have already modified or another power you know and reduce the metapsionic feat cost of that power by 2 power points for a different specific metapsionic feat.
Paraelemental Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Privileged Energy	PRETEXT:Privileged Energy*.											DESC:When using a power that allows you to choose a type of energy, you have a wider range of possible choices owing to your ability to mix energy with matter.	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:When you take this feat, you must choose the energy type you selected with your Privileged Energy feat. To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Upon manifesting a damaging energy power that matches your choice of energy, you can access paraelemental energy to further enhance your energy power with ice (cold), magma (fire), ooze (electricity), or smoke (sonic). The paraelemental power still possesses its underlying energy descriptor. Targets damaged by paraelemental powers might be affected by the additional effects noted below. In the case of an energy power that requires a saving throw, targets are only subject to these additional effects on a failed save. A successful save against the energy power negates the paraelemental effect. In the case of an energy power that normally does not allow a saving throw (such as energy ray), a target of a paraelemental power can attempt a Fortitude save at the powers DC to negate only the extra effect. Ice: As cold energy, but also limits affected foes to a single move action or standard action (not both) for 1 round as they attempt to free themselves from ice. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Magma: As fire energy, but also deals an additional 2d6 points of fire damage on the round following the attack from lingering magma. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Ooze: As electricity energy, but the target is also covered in goo and becomes entangled for 1 round, after which the goo evaporates. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Smoke: As sonic, but targets that breathe spend the following round coughing, and so are limited to a single move action or standard action (not both) for 1 round. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, choose another energy type (cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that you have also selected with the Privileged Energy feat. You can now manifest that power with the matching paraelemental effect described above.
Phrenic Leech		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																					DESC:Psionic foes damaged by your power are also mentally drained.																SOURCEPAGE:p.63	BENEFIT:You must expend your psionic focus to use this feat. This metapsionic alteration can be used with any power that targets a single individual and requires a saving throw to avoid some or all of the power's effect. If the subject fails its saving throw to avoid the phrenic leeching power's effect, it loses 1d6 power points. You gain 1 power point from the drain. If you already possess full power points, the power points drained from the target are lost. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The power's total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Stygian Power		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Stygian Archon	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Stygian Archon, know two powers that utilize negative energy.	DESC:Psionic powers you manifest that utilize negative energy are branded with an imprint of fear.											SOURCEPAGE:p.64	BENEFIT:To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can alter a stygian power that deals negative levels to toes so that any living creature that gains a negative level as a result of the power also becomes shaken for 1 minute. The target of a stygian power can attempt a Will save at the power's save DC (even if it doesn't normally allow a save) to resist this effect. This is a mind-affecting fear ability. Creatures immune to fear are not immune to the primary effect of the power, but they are immune to the shaken effect. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2. The powers total cost cannot exceed your manifester level.
Transdimensional Power	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metapsionic																					DESC:You can manifest powers that affect targets lurking in coexistent planes and extradimensional spaces whose entrancesfall within the power's area.		SOURCEPAGE:p.64	BENEFIT:You must expend your psionic focus to manifest a transdimensional power. A transdimensional power has its full normal effect on incorporeal creatures, creatures on the Ethereal Plane or the Plane of Shadow, and creatures within an extradimensional space in the power's area. This includes ethereal creatures, creatures that are blinking or shadow walking, manifested ghosts, and creatures within the extradimensional space of a rope trick, portable hole, or other portable extradimensional space. You must be able to perceive a creature to target it with a transdimensional power, but you do not need to perceive a creature to catch it in the area of a burst, cone, emanation, or spread. Using this feat does not increase the power point cost of the power. Normal: Only force effects can affect ethereal creatures, and no Material Plane attack affects creatures on the Plane of Shadow or in an enclosed extradimensional space. There is a 50%% chance that any power other than a force effect fails against an incorporeal creature.
