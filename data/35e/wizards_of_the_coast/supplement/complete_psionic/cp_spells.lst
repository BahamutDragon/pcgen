In subsequent rounds, your place in the initiative order does not change you change the time when you act for this round only.

You can't activate this power if you're flatfooted, and you can't use the power a second time until after your next turn has passed. For example, if you normally act on initiative count 15, you could use this power to act again on initiative count 12, but this means that you wouldn't be able to act on the next round at initiative count 15 (since you've already used that turn's actions), and you wouldn't be able to use the power again until after your next turn (that is, after the next round's initiative count 15).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Although the base damage of the weapon is unaltered, the weapon deals bludgeoning damage for the duration of the power. If a creature struck by a weapon affected by blackstone hammer fails its saving throw, it (along with all its carried gear) is turned into a mindless, inert statue of dark stone. Striking a creature with the weapon discharges the power. If a statue resulting from this power is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to flesh) has similar damage or deformities. the creature is not dead, but neither does it seem to be alive when viewed with spells such as deathwatch. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this power. Augment: For every 4 additional invest the weapon with an additional charge.

A target caught by the bonds can attempt purely mental actions, such as manifesting a power. However, the burrowing nature of the bonds requires that a manifester make a Concentration check for each power attempted with a DC of 20 + half the continuous damage last dealt. (The continuous damage is that damage dealt in each round after the initial round of the effect.) the target can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Alternatively, cutting or damaging the bonds can free a victim. the crystal has AC 5, hardness 12, and 30 hit points. Augment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways. 1.

(Actually, it is a real item snatched from some other random location in space and time.) You don't have to see or know of the item to call it. In fact, you can't ever call a specific item; you just specify the kind (chain shirt, full plate, buckler, and so on). the item is made of ordinary materials appropriate for its kind. Armor appears correctly donned, and a shield appears on the proper arm. Armor and shields gained by call armor are distinctive due to their astral glimmer. If a called suit of armor is ever off your body or you relinquish your grip on a called shield for 2 or more consecutive rounds, the object automatically returns to its point of origin. (For this purpose, you're considered to be wearing armor when you're donning or shedding it.) Augment: You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways. 1.

For example, if you spend 15 power points, you call a shield or a suit of armor with a +3 enhancement bonus to Armor Class. 2.

Anyone caught in the area takes 9d6 points of damage. Undead caught in the area take 2 additional points of damage per die. A construct or inanimate object takes only 5d6 points of damage from this power. This power is a positive energy effect. Augment: For every additional power point you spend, the power deals an additional 1d6 points of damage (1d6+2 against undead), and the power's save DC increases by 1.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

You haul a horror lurking beneath the target's protective sanity into reality and thrust it into her waking mind. Everyone sees something different, but many witness a nightmare of eyes, tentacles, dripping slime, and gnashing mouths all screaming atonally. Everyone other than the target sees only a vague shape that lurches forward and envelops her. If the target fails her Will saving throw, she takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage and is dazed for 1d4 rounds, though she continues to scream, cry, and froth during that time. If the target makes her Will save, she takes no damage and is not dazed. Augment: For every 2 additional save DC increases by 1.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Claws of Darkness											TYPE:Psionic																				SCHOOL:Psychometabolism								DESCRIPTOR:Darkness			COMPS:Visual			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You																DURATION:1 round/level (D)																												SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:Gain claw attacks and slow grappled targets.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Your hands and forearms elongate and change shape into featureless claws of inky blackness. You gain two natural attacks with your claws, each dealing 1d4 points of cold damage (or 1d6 points if you are Large, or 1d3 points if you are Small) plus your Strength bonus. Your claws are natural weapons, so you are considered armed when attacking with them, and they can be affected by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural weapons (such as the magic fang spell). You cannot choose to deal nonlethal damage with your claws. Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus. If you grapple an opponent, you deal claw damage with each successful grapple check, and the grappled target is under the effect of a slow spell for as long as you maintain the grapple unless the opponent makes a Fortitude save (DC 12 + key ability modifier). As a swift action, you can extend the claws up to 6 feet, which increases your reach by 5 feet, giving a Small or Medium creature a reach of 10 feet and an upright Large creature a reach of 15 feet. Augment: You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways. 1. By spending additional power points, you can create larger, sharper, and more deadly claws, as shown on the table below.

At the beginning of your next turn, when you finish manifesting the power, your foe must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 18d6 points of damage from cranial swelling.

All variable numeric effects of the next power, psi-like ability, spell, or spell-like ability that affects you before the end of your next turn is decreased to its minimum possible value. For instance, if you are struck by an energy ray augmented to deal 5d6 points of damage while protected by damp power, you would take only 5 points of damage. If the power, psi-like ability, spell, or spell-like ability affects an area as does energy ball (EPH 100), for example its effect is only minimized for you. Other creatures in the area are affected normally. Beneficial numeric effects are likewise damped when you manifest this power. Augment: If you spend 4 additional ability, spell, or spell-like ability that affects you and also affects an area is minimized for all creatures you designate within its area (not just for you).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dark Despair											TYPE:Psionic																				SCHOOL:Psychometabolism								DESCRIPTOR:Evil				COMPS:Auditory			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:10 ft.

A creature that enters the area of your aura is wracked with despair and must make a successful Will save or take a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Power resistance applies to this effect; you make your manifester level check each time a creature with power resistance enters the area of your aura (whether due to your movement or the creature's). Good creatures must endure additional hardship from exposure to the dark energy surrounding you. A good creature that enters the area of your aura rakes 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 additional point per manifester level. It continues to take this damage at the beginning of each of its turns if it remains in the area of your aura. Finally, you gain a +2 insight bonus to your Armor Class and on saves against the attacks, powers, and abilities of good creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

An ectoplasmic creature that fails its Will saving throw dissipates into constituent ectoplasm that streams to you and either adheres to an object you hold or takes up orbit around your head. A creature under the effect of the ectoplasmic form power that fails its saving throw is destroyed outright, and you detain its constituent ectoplasm. Other ongoing powers that create ectoplasmic objects or effects, such as ectoplasmic cocoon, are detained if you succeed on a manifester level check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the power's manifester level. Once you have successfully used this power, you have an ectoplasmic reserve until this power's duration elapses or until you use up the reserve. If you manifest any metacreativity power while you maintain an ectoplasmic reserve, you manifest that power as if your manifester level were one higher than normal. Once you use up your ectoplasmic reserve to increase the manifester level of a metacreativity power, the duration of this power ends. Against constructed psionic items that appear to be mere ectoplasm, such as any of the psychoactive skins, this power merely suppresses the item's abilities for 1d4 rounds (just as occurs with the dismiss ectoplasm power).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Augment: This power appears in Expanded Psionics Handbook (page 92), but it has been updated here with new augmentation options. A character who already knows the power also knows these new augmentations, which can be applied individually or all at once. 1. If you spend 2 points less than the given power point cost, you manifest this power as a full-round action. 2. If you spend 2 points less than the given power point cost, you teleport yourself and touched objects or other touched willing creatures up to 20 feet. 3. If you spend 2 additional power points, the visual display of the power is particularly dazzling. the bright flash left behind when you vacate an area dazzles all remaining creatures within a 10-foot radius of your previous position. 4.

In effect, the subject appears to be sucked down a vortex of shimmering silver energy, only to be instantly spat out in the new location, in the direction you specify (within range). the subject reappears in the same orientation as before. However, the rift in space you create to enable this movement is crudely rendered, and the target takes 5d6 points of damage in the transition. If the space into which the subject reappears is occupied, he appears in the closest unoccupied space, still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly if necessary. Augment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways. 1. For every 2 additional power points you spend, you can affect a creature of one size category larger, or double the weight of an object to be affected. 2.

Attacks with a psychic scimitar are melee touch attacks. the power gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll. Attacking with a psychic scimitar counts normally as an attack. You can choose to redirect the scimitar to attack a new opponent; doing so requires an additional standard action. the blade deals 1d6 points of damage. Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage even if you wield the blade in your hand. If you wield the scimitar in your hand, you are treated as proficient even if you lack proficiency with the scimitar. Other creatures cannot wield your psychic scimitar. A psychic scimitar always strikes from your direction. the blade cannot flank targets as a creature can. the blade is incorporeal and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion, your save bonuses, and a base Armor Class of 22. Your Intelligence modifier applies to the blade's Armor Class as if it were the scimitar's Dexterity modifier. A psychic scimitar has 4 hit points. You can also use your scimitar to deliver the effect of any power of 4th level or lower with a range of touch that you can manifest. If you make a successful attack with the blade, the power is manifested on the target as if you had manifested it yourself. After it delivers a power, or if the blade goes beyond range or moves out of your sight, the blade returns to you and hovers until given further direction. Augment: For every 2 additional scimitar deals 1 additional point of damage.

When this power is manifested, you implant a telepathic suggestion in the mind of the subject and establish a set of circumstances that trigger the suggestion. You must be 103 able to describe the trigger in no more than two sentences. Example triggers include "Midnight tomorrow evening," "When Lord ir'Daza mentions the weather," or "Wait two days, then as soon as you see the king." When the trigger event occurs, the subject senses the implanted suggestion and acts accordingly. the suggestion is telepathic and is not language-dependent; the victim will not be able to explain later why he acted the way he did. Aura sight (EPH 79) reveals the presence of a latent implanted suggestion, and aura alteration (EPH 78) can be used to remove it. If the duration of the power expires before the suggestion is triggered, it fades away harmlessly. the target makes his saving throw when the power is manifested, so you know whether your suggestion was placed successfully. Augment: For every 2 additional can affect an additional target. Each additional target must be within 15 feet of another target of the power. All targets must receive the same triggering instructions.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Suppress Schism											TYPE:Psionic	CLASSES:Psion,wilder=5																SCHOOL:Psychokinesis														COMPS:Auditory and visual	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One creature															DURATION:Instantaneous + 1 round/level							SAVEINFO:Will partial; see text						SPELLRES:Yes						SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:Block dual minds and schisms.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:Suppress schism interferes with powers and effects from the telepathy discipline. When you manifest this power, you make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +15) against each ongoing telepathy power in effect on the target creature. the DC for this dispel check is 11 + the power's manifester level. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect. In addition, if the target fails a Will save, any form of dual mind effect is disrupted for the duration of the power, including the effects of the schism power (EPH 130) and any of the various host feats (page 59 60). In the EBERRON setting, this effect works against both an Inspired's dual mind ability and a kalashtar's +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities. If the target is possessed, the possessing mind must make a save or become suppressed for the power's duration, in which case the target creature can act normally. For the duration of the power, if the target attempts to manifest a telepathy power, he must make a manifester level check (DC 11 + your manifester level) or fail to manifest the power. Augment: For every 2 additional Will save increases by 1.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

When you manifest this power, you can ready a standard action (without spending an action to do so) and use it whenever you choose before your next turn. Unlike the normal use of readied actions, you need not specify the condition under which you take your readied action. If you do not perform your readied action before your next turn, you lose that action. Augment: If you spend 2 additional the standard action you are readying. In effect, you can take your normal move action and then take any standard action at some later point in the round, depending on how events unfold.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Half lings with psionic powers often use telekinetic boomerang on daggers or throwing axes. Unlike a weapon with the returning special ability (DMG 225), a thrown weapon imbued with telekinetic boomerang returns to the thrower's hand immediately after the attack is resolved, allowing the weapon to be used again on the same turn. Augment: For every 2 additional an additional thrown weapon with the benefit of telekinetic boomerang.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telekinetic Buffer										TYPE:Psionic	CLASSES:Psion,wilder=5																SCHOOL:Psychokinesis														COMPS:Visual			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Up to 15 ft.				TARGETAREA:Emanation of up to 15-ft. radius, centered on you								DURATION:1 round/level (D)									SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:Yes						SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:Use telekinesis to force creatures away from you.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell	DESC:A telekinetic field surrounds you, appearing between you and other creatures. You decide the size of the buffer at the time of manifestation (either 0 feet, 5 feet, 10 feet, or 15 feet). A bufferradius of 0 feet means creatures can attack you (though you still gain the cover noted below). This buffer moves with you, regardless of where you go or how an opponent tries to circumvent it, providing cover (+4 bonus to Armor Class) for you against opponents. the buffer cannot push through walls or other barriers. the radius at which the buffer surrounds you remains constant for the duration, which means you will be slowed to half your normal speed if you move down a narrow corridor too small to contain the field easily. Any creature of Large or smaller size that tries to move through the field is slowed to half its normal speed. the field cannot reduce the speed of a creature of Huge or larger size, but the buffer still provides cover from such creatures. Augment: You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways. 1. For every 4 additional power points you spend, you increase the size of creature that can be affected by this power by one size category. 2. If you spend 4 additional power points, you can push an opponent back. Each round, as a standard action, you can choose one creature within the field to be subject to a bull rush with a Strength check result of 30. If the creature succeeds on its opposed check, it remains where it is, but since it is still within the field, it cannot move closer without straining (see above). If the creature fails its opposed check, it is pushed back 5 feet + an additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which the power's check result is greater than the defender's check result.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
