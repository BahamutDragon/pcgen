Her base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 1 2: The Ardent. In addition, she receives bonus power points per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 2 1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points, EPH 18).

Assume Psionic Mantle		KEY:Ardent ~ Assume Psionic Mantle			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Ardent Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DEFINE:ArdentPsionicMantleCount|0	DESC:An ardent chooses a pair of psionic mantles at 1st level and assumes one additional mantle at 2nd, 5th, 10th, and 15th level. Each mantle provides a list of powers (usually six or more) that an ardent can learn as she increases in level. Each mantle also provides an ardent with a special granted power. See Chapter 4 for a complete list of psionic mantles. Mantles represent a psionic distillation of a universal concept or philosophical idea that the ardents believe transcends the multiverse. These concepts exist beyond deities or any creation of a creature, whether mortal or immortal. An ardent can select any mantle she wants over the course of her advancement, even choosing two that seem diametrically opposed to one another, such as Good and Evil. Such ardents might seem to embody a series of contradictions, constantly seeking ways to balance (or not) the conflicting philosophies they endorse. Other ardents who pursue this approach are merely scholars seeking to understand these powerful universal truths. An ardent with both the Good and Evil (or Law and Chaos) mantles might share one or none of those alignment factors. For example, some good ardents seek to better understand the evil they combat by taking up the mantle of Evil, and the reverse is also true. Manifesting a power from an aligned mantle is considered an act of that alignment, however, so most ardents who take two opposed mantles are neutral. Most of the powers provided by a mantle are psionic in nature. Some mantles feature new abilities unlike any psionic power in existence. These abilities are still treated as psionic powers in every respect, and always have a power point cost to manifest.

SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Power Points/Day			KEY:Divine Mind ~ Power Points/Day			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Divine Mind Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:A divine mind's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points he has available. His base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 1 3: The Divine Mind. In addition, he receives bonus power points per day if he has a high Wisdom score (see Table 2 1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points, EPH 18), plus the power points provided by his Wild Talent feat. His race might also provide bonus power points per day, as might certain feats and items. A 1st- through 4th-level divine mind gains no power points for his class levels; his bonus power points (if he is entitled to any) become available when he begins to accrue the power points provided by his class at 5th level.

SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Psychic Aura			KEY:Divine Mind ~ Psychic Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Divine Mind Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:All divine minds know three basic auras: attack, defense, and perception (see below). In addition, your chosen mantle adds a specialized aura to your options. You chose one aura to manifest, and its benefits take effect in a radius around you as given on Table 1 3. Most auras affect either you and your allies or just your enemies. As you become more powerful, your aura spreads to encompass a wider area. If you know multiple mantles, you chose which aura to manifest when you meditate. You can spend an hour in meditation to change your aura. At 10th level, you can have two auras active at the same time; at 20th level, you can have three active auras. Attack: You and all allies within your aura gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every five class levels you have. Defense: You and all allies within your aura gain a +1 morale bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by 1 for every five class levels you have. Perception: You and all allies within your aura gain a +2 morale bonus on Initiative, Listen, and Spot checks.

Mantle				KEY:Divine Mind ~ Mantle				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Divine Mind Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:At 1st level, a divine mind chooses a deity to follow. He then chooses from among that deity's assigned mantles (see Table 1 4, page 11), picking one that he adopts and learns to manifest powers from. You begin play with access to a mantle and its mantle power. Each mantle has a specific granted ability that you can use. While you do not immediately know any powers, the powers in the mantle are considered on your list for the purpose of using dorjes and other items. When you gain a power known, select it from the mantle's list of powers. At 6th level, you gain a second mantle; at 12th, you gain your third and final mantle.																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Divine Grace			KEY:Divine Mind ~ Divine Grace			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Divine Mind Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Beginning at 4th level, you gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.12
Change Aura				KEY:Divine Mind ~ Change Aura				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Divine Mind Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:At 8th level, you gain the ability to change between your mantle auras much more quickly. It takes only a standard action to change between auras. You can switch auras as a move action at 14th level, and at 18th level you can change your aura as a swift action.

# Lurk
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Lurk ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Lurk Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:Lurks are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with light armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Power Points/Day			KEY:Lurk ~ Power Points/Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Lurk Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A lurk's ability to manifest powers is limited by the power points she has available. Her base daily allotment of power points is given on Table 1 5. In addition, she receives bonus power points per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 2 1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Power Points, EPH 18). Her race might also provide bonus power points per day, as might certain feats and items.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Powers Known			KEY:Lurk ~ Powers Known					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Lurk Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A lurk begins play knowing one lurk power of the player's choice. Each time she achieves a new level, she unlocks the knowledge of a new power. Powers are chosen from the lurk power list. (Exception: The Expanded Knowledge and Epic Expanded Knowledge feats from Expanded Psionics Handbook allow a lurk to learn powers from the lists of other classes.) A lurk can manifest any power that has a power point cost equal to or lower than her manifester level. The total number of powers a lurk can manifest in a day is limited only by her daily power points. A lurk simply knows her powers; they are ingrained in her mind. She does not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though she must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all her spent power points. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against lurk powers is 10 + the power's level + the lurk's Int modifier. Maximum Power Level Known: A lurk begins play with the ability to learn 1st-level powers. As she attains higher levels, she can gain the ability to master more complex powers for example, a 4th-level lurk can learn powers of 2nd level or lower, a 7th-level lurk can learn powers of 3rd level or lower, and so on. To learn or manifest a power, a lurk must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the power's level.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.14
Lurk Augment			KEY:Lurk ~ Lurk Augment					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Lurk Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DEFINE:LurkAugmentLVL|0			DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a lurk can augment her melee attack by selecting an ability from her available lurk augments. Her level determines the abilities available for her to use (see Table 1 6). In some cases, she can also use power points to increase the power of her lurk augment. The power of the lurk augment lasts for 1 round or until the lurk's next attack. If that attack misses, that use is wasted. Using a lurk augment is a swift action. When powering an augment with power points, a lurk cannot spend more total power points than her lurk level on any single lurk augment. A lurk can use her lurk augments a total number of times per day equal to her lurk level + her Int modifier. At 10th level, a lurk can choose two augments from the list in the same swift action. Both augments count against her daily total. The total power points spent on the augments is still limited to her manifester level. For example, an 11th-level lurk could choose to include a mental assault and a solid strike in her attack, and spend a total of 11 power points between the two abilities. At 18th level, a lurk can choose three augments from the list in the same swift action, which counts as three against her daily limit. The total power points spent is still limited to her manifester level.

# Anarchic Initiate
Powers Known			KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Powers Known						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:At every level, you gain additional power points per day, an increase in manifester level, and access to new powers as if you had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one manifesting class before becoming an anarchic initiate, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Chaotic Surge			KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Chaotic Surge						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:You embrace the chaos that underlies both your own turbulent mind and that of reality itself. Whenever you attempt a wild surge, you can instead choose to attempt a chaotic surge. When you attempt a chaotic surge, the benefit (and potential enervation) of a standard wild surge is unchanged. In addition to these effects, whenever you attempt a wild surge, you can choose to infuse the surge with the boiling possibility of real chaos. All variable numeric effects of a power successfully manifested with a chaotic surge are altered by a variable amount. A character with the Overchannel feat instead of the wild surge ability can also benefit from chaotic surge. The ability functions as described above, except you can activate it when using Overchannel. The benefits of Overchannel (and the damage you take from it) are unchanged. Roll d%% to determine the result, according to the following table. The variable numeric change from the chaotic surge is calculated after the power's level is adjusted for the base effect of the wild surge or Overchannel. Once the effective level of the power is determined, it is modified according to the table. A result of none means the power manifests normally (but taking into account the wild surge or Overchannel). A result of minus 50%% means all variable numeric effects of the power function at half normal level, rounding down. A result of plus 50%% means that all variable numeric effects of the power are increased by one-half (much as if the power had been altered with the Empower Power feat). A result of double means all variable numeric effects of the power are maximized, as if by the Maximize Power feat. For the purposes of feats that modify potential downsides of psychic enervation, a chaotic surge counts as a wild surge.

Anarchic Grace			KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Anarchic Grace						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 2nd level, you more fully accept the random nature of reality. Once per day, you can tap into this randomness to make your movements and posture unpredictable. This effect results in attackers having a 20%% miss chance on all their attacks. Even true seeing and similar effects can't offset this ability. Activating the effect is a free action, and it lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level. When it ends, you are automatically treated as if enervated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Wild Surge				KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Wild Surge							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:As you continue to gain levels, you improve your wild surge ability. Your wild surge improves at 3rd level and again at 7th level. The number indicated on Table 2 1 is added to your current wild surge ability rating to determine the boost given to your manifester level. If you do not already have the wild surge ability, you gain it at 3rd level. This ability functions as the wilder class feature (EPH 31).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.18
Psychic Enervation		KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Psychic Enervation					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 3rd level, you gain the psychic enervation class feature (EPH 31) if you do not already have it.

Clarity of Confusion		KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Clarity of Confusion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:Starting at 4th level, you gain a +2 insight bonus on saves against compulsion effects and effects with the lawful descriptor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Chaotic Breach, Minor		KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Chaotic Breach (Minor)					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 6th level, you can breach reality itself, allowing the chaotic influence of Limbo to seep into reality. You can trigger a breach a number of times per day equal to your class level. Once a breach comes fully into being, it has a duration of 1 round per class level (you can dismiss it early as a free action). As a standard action, you can trigger a chaotic breach that takes 1d4 rounds to fully come into being, accompanied by discharges of multicolored light, wild gusts, and deep rumbling sounds. The breach occurs in a 20-foot-radius spread, the center of which you can place up to 100 feet away. Once it is placed, the spread is fixed. Once the breach is fully realized, all powers, psi-like abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities manifested, cast, or used in the affected radius are impeded by the chaotic energies of Limbo and have a chance to go awry. Your ability to manifest powers or use psi-like abilities is unimpeded. All other manifesters, spellcasters, or creatures must make a manifester level check or caster level check against a DC of 10 + 1/2 your class level + the level of the attempted power or spell. If the check fails, roll on the table in the Wild Magic section (DMG 149) to determine the outcome of the effect. The table only references spells, but powers are affected in the same way. Exceptions include references to a spell not being expended (power points are not expended, instead) or to material components not being expended (since powers do not have components).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Postpone Enervation		KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Postpone Enervation					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:At 8th level, you discover that cause and effect are bound less tightly then you had realized. You gain the Postpone Enervation feat (page 57) as a bonus feat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Chaotic Breach, Complete	KEY:Anarchic Initiate ~ Chaotic Breach (Complete)				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Anarchic Initiate Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At 10th level, you can completely pierce reality and punch a hole into the outer plane of Limbo once per day. As with a minor chaotic breach, you can trigger the breach as a standard action; it takes 1d4 rounds to fully come into being. Once a breach comes fully into being, it has a duration of 1 round per class level (you can dismiss it early as a free action). When a complete breach occurs, it rips a hole in reality. The hole takes the shape of a 10-foot-radius sphere in the center of a 50-foot-radius spread (the same radius as a minor breach) on both affected planes. This larger area exists on both affected planes and contains the traits of both affected planes. The hole at the center is an open portal between the planes, where creatures from either plane can move through the breach at will. If you choose to form the breach directly on a creature, the creature must make a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 your class level + your Cha modifier). On a successful save, the breach forms normally 1d4 rounds later (and with enough warning for the creature to move away from the rift). On a failed save, the breach doesn't form at all; instead, the subject is pushed bodily through into Limbo. Unless the creature has a method of returning																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.19

# Ebon Saint
Powers Known			KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Powers Known								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																					DESC:At every level above 1st level, you gain additional power points per day, an increase in manifester level, and access to new powers as if you had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one manifesting class before becoming an ebon saint, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Dire Strike				KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Dire Strike								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Ebon saints are trained at infiltration and gathering of information through subversive means. If you study a creature for 1 round and then make a successful sneak attack against that creature, you gain an insight into that creature's abilities. For the rest of that encounter, you gain a bonus on attack rolls made against that creature equal to your ebon saint level. You also gain a dodge bonus to AC against that creature's attacks equal to one-half your class level, rounding down (minimum 1). In addition, a creature you have used dire strike against is subject to dire augments that are unique to the ebon saint class. Once you have completed your round of study, you must make your dire strike attempt within the next 3 rounds. If you do not, you must spend another round studying your target before you can attempt a dire strike. You cannot use a dire strike against an unconscious opponent. As with a sneak attack, you can deal nonlethal damage with a dire strike, which becomes important when you master the disappear from the mind ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Shadowfriend			KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Shadowfriend								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:While you are psionically focused, you gain an enhancement bonus on Hide checks and Move Silently checks equal to your class level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Dire Augments			KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Dire Augments							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																					DESC:An ebon saint gains dire augments that function much as the lurk class feature does (see page 14). While a lurk's abilities cover a spread of options, however, you have dedicated yourself to the art of infiltration and espionage. Using a dire augment is a swift action. You can spend a number of power points less than or equal to your character level on a single attack. You can use your dire augments a number of times per day equal to 3 + your ebon saint level. In addition, you can only use your dire augments to modify a dire strike attack, not a normal sneak attack. At 3rd level, you can combine any two of your dire augments in a single dire strike (as a single swift action), provided you can pay the power point cost of each ability. At 5th level, you can combine any three of your dire augments in a single dire strike, provided you can pay the power point cost of each ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Thought Theft			KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Thought Theft							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can gain insight into any hazards you will encounter in the near future that your victim is aware of. If your dire strike is successful, you can access the creature's mind in a manner similar to the read thoughts power (EPH 128). The information you ascertain is the nature of any hazards the creature is aware of within 50 feet. Hazards include traps, enemies, and other obstacles intended to impede you or cause you harm. You become aware of these hazards in only the most general sense. You might learn, for example, that a trap lies 30 feet down a corridor from your victim, but not the nature of the trap or how to bypass it. You might also learn that a patrol of four guards comes down the corridor every few minutes, but not the race or weaponry of each of the guards. The creature can attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Int modifier) to resist the thought theft. Using this augment costs 3 power points. For every 2 additional power points you spend, the save DC of the ability increases by 1.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Mind Interrogation		KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Mind Interrogation							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the ability to steal specific important information directly from the mind of the victim of one of your dire strikes. When you make a successful dire strike against a foe that deals damage, you can visualize one question in your mind and spend 4 power points. If your victim knows the answer to the question, you immediately know the answer as well.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Steal Form				KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Steal Form								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:At 4th level, you learn the pinnacle of successful infiltration: You can become the victims of your dire strikes. If you make a successful dire strike attack and spend 5 power points, you can shift your form into that of your victim as a full-round action, as if using an alter self spell (PH 197) cast by a spellcaster of your ebon saint level. You can shift back into your own form with another full-round action; doing so does not require an expenditure of power points. You can also shift back into the form of your victim again at any time during the next 24 hours by spending 5 more power points. You only have a total time of 50 minutes to use your victim's form, but you can spread that time out over the 24-hour period. Once 24 hours have elapsed, you can no longer access the victim's form unless you seek out that creature and perform another successful dire strike against it (if it is still alive). You are subject to the same limitations as described in the alter self spell when using this ability. You can "collect" a total number of five forms in a given 24-hour period that you can use, although you must pay power points separately for each one and you must still successfully use dire strike against each victim.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Disappear from the Mind		KEY:Ebon Saint ~ Disappear from the Mind						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ebon Saint Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:At 5th level, you master the art of disappearing right in front of your victim. When you make a successful dire strike attack that deals nonlethal damage, you can spend 5 power points to erase your presence from the victim's mind. This works as the cloud mind power. Your victim can attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Int modifier) to resist the effect. If you have dealt lethal damage to your victim within the previous 24 hours, you cannot use this ability against that target. If you deal lethal damage to the target at any point after using this ability successfully, it remembers everything about this encounter. You must remove yourself from the victim's line of sight within 1 round of using this power, or the creature remembers everything. You must remain out of sight for at least 1 minute; once this time has passed, the creature treats you as if the previous encounter never happened if you again expose yourself to its line of sight.

Any construct you create with the astral construct power has 2d6 temporary hit points that last for the duration of the astral construct power. Your astral constructs no longer gain the benefit of this ability if you do not have a number of ranks in Craft (sculpting) equal to or greater than your manifester level.

This healing kicks in automatically (without any action on your part) on the first occasion in a 24-hour span when your hit points drop to 0 or lower. When this occurs, a flood of positive energy discharges through the conduit you maintain with the Positive Energy Plane and instantly heals 5d8+5 points of damage. This healing is timely enough to keep you alive if the amount of damage you just took was otherwise enough to kill you, assuming that the healing you receive leaves your current hit points at 9 or higher.

# Soulbow
Mind Arrow				KEY:Soulbow ~ Mind Arrow								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Soulbow Class Feature.SpecialQuality																			DESC:As a free action, you can create a semisolid arrow composed of psychic energy distilled from your mind. If your base attack bonus is high enough to grant you multiple attacks, you can create multiple mind arrows as part of an attack. You must have one hand free to create and project a mind arrow. The bolt is identical in all ways (except visually) to an arrow shot from a composite longbow. For instance, a Medium soulbow materializes an arrow that speeds toward the specified target, and if it hits, deals 1d8 points of damage (crit ?3) plus extra damage equal to the soulbow's Wisdom modifer. Soulbows who are smaller or larger than Medium create mind arrows identical to arrows shot from composite longbows appropriate for their size, with a corresponding change to the arrow's damage (see Table 7 4 and Table 7 5 in the Player's Handbook). You gain the usual benefit to your attack roll from a high Dexterity bonus. Whether a mind arrow hits or misses, it dissipates 1 round after being shot. A mind arrow is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A mind arrow can be charged with a psychic strike as if it were a mind blade. If a soulbow has enough soulknife levels to have the knife to the soul ability, that ability also applies to her mind arrows. You can use feats such as Point Blank Shot or Precise Shot in conjunction with a mind arrow (see bonus feats provided by the class for further guidance). You can also choose mind arrow for feats requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Specialization. Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade. Any feats previously requiring specific weapon choice (such as Weapon Specialization) for your mind blade also apply to your mind arrow, if applicable. Your mind arrows improve as you gain higher levels. At 3rd level, a mind arrow gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and at 7th level the bonus improves to +2. These enhancement bonuses stack with previous enhancement bonuses gained earlier for your soulknife class levels. Likewise, these enhancement bonuses also improve your soulknife base attack bonus. If your return to your soulknife class progression, these mind arrow enhancement bonuses on attack and damage are cumulative bonuses on top of any new enhancement bonuses gained, and they benefit both your mind blade and mind arrows. Even in places where psionic effects do not normally function (such as within a null psionics field), you can attempt to attack foes with mind arrows by making a DC 20 Will save. On a successful save, you can freely produce mind arrows for a number of rounds equal to your class level before you need to check again. On an unsuccessful attempt, you must wait 1 round before trying again while you remain within the psionics-negating effect.

Greater Psionic Shot, Fell Shot, Rapid Shot, Manyshot, Greater Manyshot, Shot on the Run, Improved Precise Shot, and Mounted Archery. You must meet the prerequisites for the feat as normal. Feats that grant additional attacks, such as Rapid Shot, allow you to create additional semisolid arrows of psychic energy as needed to make additional attacks. The list of potential bonus feats can be expanded by the DM to include any feats from other supplements that improved ranged attacks. For instance, if your game makes use of Complete Warrior, this list might also include Improved Mounted Archer, Improved Rapid Shot, Ranged Disarm, Ranged Pin (in which case the mind arrow persists until the pinned character breaks the pin), Ranged Sunder, Sharp Shooting, and Zen Archery.

Choose any one of the weapon special abilities on the table below that has an enhancement bonus value of +1. From now on, mind arrows you produce as part of an attack possess that special ability. At every four levels beyond 2nd (6th and 10th), the value of the enhancement you can add to your mind arrow improves to +2 and +3, respectively. You can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by your soulbow level. The special ability provided by this class feature does not stack with the soulknife's mind blade enhancement ability. You can reassign the ability or abilities you have chosen for your mind arrows. To do so, you must spend 8 hours in concentration. After that period, all subsequent mind arrows you produce as part of an attack action possess the new ability or abilities selected by you.

The mind arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical or nonpsionic barrier or wall on its way. (A wall of force, wall of fire, wall of ectoplasm, or the like stops a mind arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.

You simply know your powers; they are ingrained in your mind. You do not need to prepare them (in the way that some spellcasters prepare their spells), though you must get a good night's sleep each day to regain all your spent power points. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against zerth cenobite powers is 10 + the power's level + the zerth cenobite's Wis modifier. For example, the saving throw against a 2nd-level power has a DC of 12 + Wis modifier.

Declaring a temporal strike is a swift action that follows a successful melee attack. The target of the strike must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). If your foe fails his saving throw, he is hurled forward in time in addition to taking damage normally. The subject is propelled 10 rounds forward in time by the violence of the strike.

Thus, a 1st-level erudite can manifest one unique power per day; however, the total number of powers he can manifest per day is limited only by his daily power points (that is, the erudite could manifest the unique power as many times per day as he has power points to pay for it).

Naturally Psionic		KEY:Synad ~ Naturally Psionic	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Synad Race Trait.SpecialQuality				DESC:Synads gain 3 bonus power points at 1st level, one each for the overmind, the collective, and the oracle. This does not grant synads the ability to manifest powers unless they gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic class.																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.140
Threefold Mind		KEY:Synad ~ Threefold Mind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Synad Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:The threefold synthesis of mind, controlled by the overmind, grants synads an advantage when resisting mental attacks. They gain a +2 bonus on Will saving throws.																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.140
Oracle			KEY:Synad ~ Oracle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Synad Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:The part of a synad's mind known as the oracle grants him a daily precognitive edge. This translates into a +2 insight bonus that the synad can apply at any time to an initiative check, attack roll, or saving throw. In the case of an attack roll or saving throw, the synad can elect to apply the bonus to the roll or save after he determines whether his unmodified roll misses. A synad can apply only one precognitive edge per day.																													SOURCEPAGE:p.140
Collective			KEY:Synad ~ Collective		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Synad Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:The part of a synad's mind known as the collective allows him to tap into a racial network of knowledge and information. A synad can spend 1 power point as a free action to gain a +2 bonus on any Knowledge or Psicraft check he makes.																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.140
Multitask			KEY:Synad ~ Multitask		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Synad Race Trait.SpecialQuality	DESC:A synad's threefold mind can temporarily separate, allowing him to take more than a single mental action during his turn. Once per day, a synad can spend 1 power point to gain a swift action that he can use to take any purely mental action. Examples include manifesting a psionic power or making a Knowledge, Psicraft, or other check requiring only mental cogitation. However, a synad can use his extra mental action to manifest a power only if the normal actions allowed to him during the round do not also involve manifesting a power.											SOURCEPAGE:p.140
