Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:Cancer mages are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.

Sneak Attack				KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Sneak Attack						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:CancerMageSneakAttackLVL|0													DESC:If a cancer mage can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basically, any time the cancer mage's target would be denied her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the cancer mage's attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every four levels (+2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 9th level). Should the cancer mage score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a cancer mage can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because he must make optimal use of his weapon in order to execute the sneak attack. A cancer mage can only sneak attack a living creature with a discernible anatomy-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the cancer mage must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. A cancer mage cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If a cancer mage gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack.

Disease Host				KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Disease Host						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																					DESC:At 1st level, a cancer mage suffers no ill effects of diseases, except for purely cosmetic ones such as boils, pockmarks, watery eyes, blackened skin, hair loss, foul smell, and so on. The cancer mage becomes a carrier of every disease he encounters, though he remains immune to most of their effects. However, the cancer mage takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level if someone casts a cure disease spell or effect on him (he can make a Fortitude save to try to resist the effect). Furthermore, if the cancer mage has a cancerous companion (see below), he loses all abilities gained from the companion for 1d10 days after being the subject of a cure disease spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Contagion					KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Contagion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, the touch of a cancer mage carries a contagion spell once per day per class level. The DC for the target's saving throw is 13 + the cancer mage's Wisdom modifier.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Cancerous Companion			KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Cancerous Companion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																					DESC:At 2nd level, a cancer grows within the cancer mage, forming a large tumor. This cancerous growth gains intelligence and a personality distinct from the cancer mage. The companion and the cancer mage can communicate telepathically. When needed, the cancerous companion uses the cancer mage's scores for saves, ability scores other than Intelligence, and so forth. The cancerous companion gains abilities as the cancer mage gains levels.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Tatterdemalion				KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Tatterdemalion						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																					DESC:Gathering scraps of clothing and old, discarded rags, a 3rd-level cancer mage is able to make such articles into light armor with a the following stats: armor bonus +4, maximum Dex bonus +5, armor check penalty -1, arcane spell failure 15%%, speed 30 ft./20 ft., weight 20 lb. Only a 3rd-level or higher cancer mage can wear this armor and gain these benefits; other wearers treat it as padded armor. This armor is considered masterwork quality and can be fashioned into magic armor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Poison					KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Poison							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:Once per day per class level beginning at 3rd level, the touch of a cancer mage carries a poison spell. The DC for the target's saving throw is 14 + the cancer mage's Wisdom modifier.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Children of the Night			KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Children of the Night					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:A 4th-level cancer mage commands the lesser creatures of the world and can call forth a swarm of 2d6 Small monstrous spiders or a pack of 4d8 dire rats or a swarm of 10d10 bats, once per day, as a standard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the cancer mage (understanding his mental commands) for up to 10 minutes per class level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Viral Agent					KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Viral Agent							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:At 5th level, a cancer mage befriends a disease or virus that infests his body. He supernaturally enhances a disease, making it smarter by giving it a point of his own Intelligence. He establishes a telepathic link with the disease that functions at a range of one mile per class level of the cancer mage. The cancer mage can then attempt to infect a target with his viral agent, using his contagion ability. If successful, the viral agent can tell the cancer mage telepathically what its host experiences. In all other respects, the viral agent is a normal disease; if the victim fights it off or a cure disease spell is used, the disease and the viral agent die. The cancer mage regains his Intelligence point 24 hours after the viral agent dies. The cancer mage can create as many viral agents as he is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Infected Wound				KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Infected Wound						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:CancerMageInfectedWoundLVL|0													DESC:Once per day per class level beginning at 6th level, a cancer mage can infect his foe with an infectious taint after making a successful melee attack. The foe takes 1 point of Constitution damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + cancer mage's class level + cancer mage's Wis modifier) 1 hour later or take a further 1d6 points of Constitution damage.

Insect Plague				KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Insect Plague						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:At 7th level, a cancer mage invokes insect plague once per day as a cleric of his class level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Insect Armor				KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Insect Armor						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:By allowing insects and worms to crawl over his body, a 7th-level cancer mage gains a +4 natural armor bonus. The cancer mage cannot wear armor heavier than light armor and keep this benefit, however.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Viral Ally					KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Viral Ally							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:In a fashion similar to the viral agent ability, a cancer mage of 8th level or higher can create a viral ally by devoting 3 points of Intelligence to a disease or virus in his system. The cancer mage can then bestow his viral ally upon a humanoid victim using his contagion ability, and the viral ally can communicate telepathically with the cancer mage. The viral ally (and thus the cancer mage) controls its host as surely as with a dominate person spell, although the host gets no separate saving throw to avoid the dominate person effect. The viral ally is a normal disease, however, and the victim can fight it off with successful Fortitude saves or a cure disease spell, either of which kills the viral ally. The cancer mage regains his missing Intelligence points 24 hours later. A cancer mage can create as many viral allies as he is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.54
Disease Form				KEY:Cancer Mage ~ Disease Form						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.Cancer MageClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:At 10th level, a cancer mage gains the ability to tranform into a disease once per day. (This ability also affects up to 100 pounds of gear the cancer mage is carrying, plus tatterdemalion armor, insect armor, and a cancerous companion.) As a disease, the cancer mage is intangible and invisible to standard methods of observation, even blindsight. Creatures with the scent ability note a foulness in the air. The cancer mage cannot move, except with the wind (if any), or within a host. The cancer mage may adopt his disease form as a standard action, attempting to infect a living creature within 100 feet. A potential victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 20) to avoid being infected with the cancer mage. Any creature that comes within 10 feet of a cancer mage in disease form is subject to the saving throw to resist infection as well. Once inside an infected host, the cancer mage deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage per day after a 24-hour incubation period. The victim has no way of knowing that the cancer mage is anything other than a normal illness. The cancer mage travels with the victim, aware of whatever the victim is aware of. A number of times per day equal to the cancer mage's Charisma bonus, the cancer mage can attempt to force the victim to take one round's worth of actions of the cancer mage's choosing; a successful Will save (DC 18 + cancer mage's Wis modifier) allows the victim to resist this. While controlling his victim, the cancer mage has access to all skills, feats, spells, and special abilities of the host, plus any of his own that he can use in his disembodied state. The cancer mage can leave his host at any time, allowing the victim to recover normally. The victim can also attempt to force the cancer mage out by making Fortitude saves as if the cancer mage were a normal disease. Heal checks help the victim as they would normally. A cure disease spell kills the cancer mage if he fails a Fortitude save (calculating the save DC as for spells of the same level). Even if the cancer mage succeeds at the saving throw, he is forced to reassume his material form adjacent to the victim. A cancer mage can remain in disease form as long as he desires, or he can return to his natural form and be done with the disease form for that day. While in disease form, the cancer mage does not need to eat, sleep, or drink, and he does not age. A cancer mage could remain dormant in a room for a hundred years, then take his material form or infect a new victim.

# Demonologist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Demonologist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DemonologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:Demonologists are proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Spells					KEY:Demonologist ~ Spells							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DemonologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:Beginning at 1st level, a demonologist gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, the demonologist must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a demonologist with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Demonologist bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Charisma modifier. The demonologist's spell list appears below; a demonologist has access to any spell on the list and need not prepare those spells ahead of time, just like a sorcerer. A demonologist casts spells just as a sorcerer does.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Charm Demon					KEY:Demonologist ~ Charm Demon						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.ClassFeatures.DemonologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:A 1st-level demonologist can attempt to charm a chaotic evil outsider, as described in the charm person spell, once per day.

SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Quasit Familiar				KEY:Demonologist ~ Quasit Familiar						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.DemonologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																					DESC:A 2nd-level demonologist gains a quasit as a familiar, whether he wants it or not. If the demonologist already has a familiar, the quasit devours it and takes its place, but the character suffers no experience point loss. The quasit is treated as a normal familiar, using the class level of the demonologist as the master's level (see the Familiars section in Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook for familiar abilities).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Summoning Mastery				KEY:Demonologist ~ Summoning Mastery					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.DemonologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:DemonologistSummoningMasteryLVL|0												DESC:When a demonologist of 3rd level or higher casts a summon monster spell, it is treated as the equivalent spell of two levels higher for purposes of summoning chaotic evil creatures. For example, a demonologist refers to the summon monster IV list for chaotic evil outsiders when casting summon monster II. At 6th level, the demonologist refers to the summoning list three levels higher than the one for the summon monster spell he is casting. At 9th level, the demonologist refers to the list four levels higher.

The demon does not get to use its spell resistance, though it can make a saving throw as normal (DC 12 + demonologist's Cha modifier).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.55
Telepathy					KEY:Demonologist ~ Telepathy							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.DemonologistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																					DESC:An 8th-level demonologist can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language, just as a tanar'ri can.

# Diabolist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Diabolist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DiabolistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:Diabolists are proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Spells					KEY:Diabolist ~ Spells								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.DiabolistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:When a diabolist attains 1st level, and at every level after that, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points beyond those received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the new level of diabolist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. For example, if LadyMandrake, a 9th-level sorcerer, gains a level in diabolist, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 10th level in sorcerer, but uses the other diabolist aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonuses. If she next gains a level of sorcerer, making her a 10th-level sorcerer/1st-level diabolist, she gains spells as if she had risen to 11th level as a sorcerer. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a diabolist, she must decide to which class she adds the level of diabolist.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.56
Diabolism					KEY:Diabolist ~ Diabolism							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.DiabolistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality				DEFINE:DiabolistDiabolismLVL|0	DEFINE:DiabolismDie|0									DESC:A diabolist can choose to grant one of her spells greater magical power once per day plus one additional time for every three class levels. Any spell the diabolist casts that affects a target or area (one that does not include herself ) gains the evil descriptor and deals +1d6 points of unholy damage to any good character affected by the spell. For example, a fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard/1st-level diabolist deals 7d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage. A hold person spell cast by the same diabolist holds a humanoid target motionless and deals 1d6 points of unholy damage if the target is good. At 5th level, the unholy damage increases to +2d6 points. At 10th level, the unholy damage increases to +3d6 points.

Imp Familiar				KEY:Diabolist ~ Imp Familiar							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.DiabolistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:A 2nd-level diabolist gains an imp as a familiar, whether she wants it or not. If the diabolist already has a familiar, the imp devours it and takes its place. The imp is treated as a normal familiar, using the class level of the diabolist as the wizard's level (see the Familiars section in Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook for familiar abilities).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.57
Vile Diabolism				KEY:Diabolist ~ Vile Diabolism						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.DiabolistClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:An 8th-level diabolist can use her diabolism power to deal half the normal amount of extra unholy damage as vile damage (see Chapter 2 for an explanation of vile damage). For example, a fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard/8th-level diabolist deals 10d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of unholy damage. If the diabolist then rolls a 7 for the 2d6 points of unholy damage, she can (if she chooses) convert the unholy damage into 3 points of vile damage instead.

SOURCEPAGE:p.58
Spells					KEY:Disciple of Asmodeus ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Disciple of AsmodeusClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:When a disciple of Asmodeus attains 1st level, and at every other level after that, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points beyond those received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the new level of disciple of Asmodeus to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. For example, if Ulthanc, an 8th-level wizard, gains a level in disciple of Asmodeus, he gains new spells as if he had risen to 9th level in wizard, but uses the other disciple of Asmodeus aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus. If he next gains a level of wizard, making him a 9th-level wizard/1st-level disciple of Asmodeus, he gains spells as if he had risen to 10th level as a wizard. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a disciple of Asmodeus, he must decide to which class he adds the level of disciple of Asmodeus.

At 1st level, the disciple can make a Gather Information check once per week with a +10 competency bonus. For every two levels beyond 1st level, the disciple of Asmodeus can use this ability one more time per week (twice at 3rd level, three times at 5th level, and so on) until 9th level, when the disciple of Asmodeus can use the ability once per day.

Basically, any time the disciple's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the disciple's attack deals +1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every third level afterward (+2d6 at 5th level, +3d6 at 8th level). Should the disciple score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is 30 feet away or less. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a disciple of Baalzebul can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the sneak attack. A disciple of Baalzebul can only sneak attack a living creatures with a discernible anatomy-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. Also, the disciple of Baalzebul must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital spot. The disciple cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

# Ur-Priest
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Ur-PriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:An ur-priest is proficient with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Spells					KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Spells								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Ur-PriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:An ur-priest gains the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the ur-priest must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an ur-priest with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Urpriest bonus spells are based onWisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level +Wisdom modifier. When Table 5-16 indicates 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 2nd-level spells at 2nd level, the ur-priest gets only bonus spells. An ur-priest without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. The ur-priest's spell list is identical to the cleric's spell list. An ur-priest has access to any spell on the list and prepares those spells as a cleric, except that she does not pray for spells, she just takes them. An ur-priest casts spells as a cleric ity to spontaneously cast inflict or cure spells, nor does she have domain spells or associated domain granted powers. She does not have restrictions on spells with alignments. To determine the caster level of an ur-priest, add the character's ur-priest levels to one-half of her levels in other spellcasting classes. (Any levels gained in the cleric class by an ex-cleric don't count.)																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.72
Rebuke Undead				KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Rebuke Undead							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Ur-PriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:Like an evil cleric, an ur-priest of 2nd level or higher can rebuke undead. She uses her ur-priest level as the cleric level for determining success and damage (see Turn and Rebuke Undead in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).

Divine Spell Resistance			KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Divine Spell Resistance					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.Ur-PriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:At 4th level, an ur-priest gains spell resistance 15, but only against divine spells and the spell-like abilities of outsiders. At 8th level, the urpriest's spell resistance increases to 20.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Siphon Spell Power			KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Siphon Spell Power						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.ClassFeatures.Ur-PriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:Because they steal whatever power they can, ur-priests learn to manipulate their energy in ways that confound other casters. A 6th-level ur-priest can temporarily sacrifice two (or more) lower-level spell slots and use those slots to prepare a higher-level spell. The hnigher-level spell must be of a level the ur-priest can cast. Only one exchange of this sort can be made each day. The levels of the lower-level slots are totaled, then reduced to three-quarters (round down) to determine the level of the extra higher-level spell slot. For example, an ur-priest who sacrifices a 3rd-level spell and a 5th-level spell can use that spell slot to prepare an additional 6th-level spell (3 + 5 = 8, and 8 ? 3/4 = 6).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.73
Steal Spell-Like Ability		KEY:Ur-Priest ~ Steal Spell-Like Ability					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.ClassFeatures.Ur-PriestClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																						DESC:The most powerful urpriests can use the same techniques that siphon off the gods' spell power to steal the spell-like abilities of another creature. Once each day, when a creature with spell-like abilities is within 50 feet of a 10th-level ur-priest, the ur-priest can choose one of the spell-like abilities of the creature to steal for herself. The ur-priest can use the spell-like ability as often as the creature can, or three times per day, whichever is less.The ur-priest uses the ability as the creature does with regard to caster level and save DCs. This ability only lasts 24 hours. The creature with the spell-like ability does not lose the ability when the ur-priest steals it. If the ur-priest tries to steal a spell-like ability that the creature doesn't have, or tries to steal an ability that is supernatural rather than spell-like, the attempt automatically fails. For example, if an ur-priest is near a noble salamander, she can steal fireball and use it three times that day or steal dispel magic and use it once that day. If she is near a pit fiend, she could steal teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only) and use it three times per day, because the pit fiend can do it at will. She could even steal the pit fiend's wish ability, but because a pit fiend can only use wish once per year, the ur-priest would be similarly limited. She could not steal that power again from any creature for one year.

# Vermin Lord
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Vermin Lord ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Vermin LordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:A vermin lord is proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Spells					KEY:Vermin Lord ~ Spells							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassFeatures.Vermin LordClassFeatures.SpecialQuality																								DESC:When a vermin lord attains 1st level and every two levels after that (plus 10th level), the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points beyond those received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the new level of vermin lord to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. For example, if Silican, an 8th-level wizard, gains a level in vermin lord, he gains new spells as if he had risen to 9th level in wizard, but uses the other vermin lord aspects of level progression such as attack bonus and save bonus. If he next gains a level of wizard, making him a 9th-level wizard/1st-level vermin lord, he gains spells as if he had risen to 10th-level wizard. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a vermin lord, he must decide to which class he adds the level of vermin lord.

These insects absorb up to 10 points of damage from any damaging attack (weapons or spells). The insects die off when they absorb such attacks, and a total of up to 5 points per vermin lord level can be absorbed per day. Thus, a 7th-level vermin lord's swarm armor can absorb up to 35 points of damage, although no more than 10 points from any one attack. If a vermin lord is already wearing armor, the swarm armor has no effect.
