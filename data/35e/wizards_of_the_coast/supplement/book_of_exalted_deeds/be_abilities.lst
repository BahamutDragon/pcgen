Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Apostle of Peace ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Apostle of Peace Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Apostles of peace gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor. As part of their sacred vows, apostles of peace forswear the use of armor, though they may wear magic items that protect them (such as a ring of protection or bracers of armor). An apostle of peace who wears any armor is unable to cast apostle of peace spells or use any of his supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.52
Spells				KEY:Apostle of Peace ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Apostle of Peace Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:An apostle of peace has the ability to cast a number of divine spells. To cast an apostle of peace spell, the apostle must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an apostle with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Apostle of peace bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the apostle of peace's Wisdom modifier. When the apostle of peace gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 2nd-level spells for a 2nd-level apostle), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The apostle of peace's spell list appears below. An apostle of peace prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does. To determine the caster level of an apostle of peace, add the character's apostle levels to one-half of his caster levels in other spellcasting classes.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.52
Spontaneous Casting		KEY:Apostle of Peace ~ Spontaneous Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Apostle of Peace Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:An apostle of peace can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the apostle did not prepare ahead of time. An apostle can "lose" any prepared apostle spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

Turn Undead				KEY:Apostle of Peace ~ Turn Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Apostle of Peace Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An apostle of peace can turn undead as a good cleric of his apostle of peace level would. If he is also a cleric (or paladin), he adds his apostle levels to his effective cleric levels to determine his turning capability.																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.52
Pacifying Touch			KEY:Apostle of Peace ~ Pacifying Touch			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Apostle of Peace Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 2nd level, an apostle of peace gains the ability to pacify hostile or angry creatures by touch. The effect is similar to the calm emotions spell. The apostle can affect only a single target with each use of the ability, and must touch the target. A touched creature receives no saving throw and spell resistance does not apply. The pacifying touch does not suppress positive emotions, just anger, rage, and hostility. The apostle of peace can make a level check as if casting dispel magic, using his character level as his caster level, to dispel certain mind-affecting spells affecting the target. The pacifying touch can only dispel spells that incite violent emotions in the target, such as fear or rage.																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.52
Censure Fiends			KEY:Apostle of Peace ~ Censure Fiends			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Apostle of Peace Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 4rd-level apostle of peace can censure fiends, much as good clerics turn undead. Channeling holy power from the celestial planes, he can make demons, devils, and other outsiders with the evil subtype recoil. Make a Charisma check for the apostle and consult Table 8-9 in the Player's Handbook, using the apostle's character level to determine the most powerful fiend he can censure. Roll 2d6 + the apostle of peace's level + his Charisma modifier for censuring damage. Using both the apostle's character level and his class level in this manner means that he is more likely to affect a single powerful fiend, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. A censured fiend is stunned by the apostle's holy power for 1d4+1 rounds. If an apostle of peace attacks a censured fiend, the stunning ends immediately and the fiend can act normally on its next turn. If the apostle of peace's character level is at least twice the fiend's Hit Dice, he banishes the affected fiend back to its home plane. An apostle of peace can make a number of censuring attempts per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. These attempts are separate from any attempts to turn undead.	SOURCEPAGE:p.52

In this defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender of Sealtiel's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points.

Emissary of Barachiel bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the emissary's Charisma modifier. When the emissary gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level emissary of Barachiel), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.

Calling				KEY:Emissary of Barachiel ~ Calling					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Emissary of Barachiel Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:An emissary of Barachiel's most fundamental ability is the power to issue a celestial call, stirring the conscience of those who hear it. An emissary can use this ability once per day per class level, spending a full-round action to issue the call. Humanoid creatures within 30 feet of the emissary are potentially affected. The emissary makes a Diplomacy check, and the result is the DC for affected creatures' Will saving throws. Creatures that fail their saves suffer effects that depend on their alignment, as follows: Alignment Effect Lawful good Inspired Neutral good or chaotic good Blessed Lawful neutral Enthralled Neutral or chaotic neutral Enthralled, disheartened Any evil Stunned, demoralized Inspired: Affected creatures receive a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill and ability checks, and weapon damage rolls for 10 minutes. Blessed: Affected creatures receive a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects for 10 minutes. Enthralled: Affected creatures act as if subject to an enthrall spell for as long as you continue to speak and for 1d3 rounds thereafter. For the duration of the effect and for 1 day afterward, affected creatures take a -1 penalty on Will saves related to redemption (see Chapter 2). Disheartened: Affected creatures take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 10 minutes. Stunned: Affected creatures are stunned for 1 round. Demoralized: Affected creatures take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and weapon damage rolls for 10 minutes (including the 1 round during which they are stunned). Using any manifestation of the calling class ability requires the use of the Words of Creation and deals 3d4 points of nonlethal damage to the emissary. Calling is an Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting] effect.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.60
Conversion				KEY:Emissary of Barachiel ~ Conversion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Emissary of Barachiel Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 3rd-level emissary of Barachiel can use his calling ability to facilitate actual conversion of nongood humanoids. Doing so counts as a use of the calling class ability (see above) for the day, and the initial effects of the calling are the same-except that the emissary takes 5d4 points of nonlethal damage instead of 3d4. When the initial effects are over, however, all creatures that were subject to any effect of the calling (except lawful good creatures) must make another saving throw. Creatures who fail begin acting as though their alignment were one step closer to good. Lawful evil creatures act lawful neutral, neutral evil creatures act neutral, and chaotic evil creatures act chaotic neutral. Lawful neutral and neutral good creatures act lawful good. True neutral and chaotic good creatures act neutral good, and chaotic neutral creatures act chaotic good. Creatures affected by this temporary alignment shift can make new saving throws each day for a total of seven days. If the emissary is not present at the time a creature makes its save, it receives a +1 circumstance bonus on the saving throw, and this bonus increases by 1 for each additional saving throw for which the emissary is not present. During these seven days, an affected creature is immune to any other conversion effect, from the same emissary or a different one. During this time, the alignment shift can be reversed with a break enchantment spell, but the caster must succeed on a caster level check against a DC equal to the emissary's original Diplomacy check result. Also during this time, an atonement spell can make the alignment shift permanent, preventing the creature from making any additional saving throws. If a creature fails seven saving throws after the initial saving throw against the calling, the alignment change is permanent. At this point, the creature can change alignment again, either through another conversion effect, or voluntarily (in a gradual manner, as alignment change normally works-the creature cannot simply decide to be evil again).

Dispel a charm or compulsion effect cast by an evil creature upon a good target, by making a dispel check (1d20 + character level against a DC of 11 + evil caster's level).

Ecstasy				KEY:Prophet of Erathaol ~ Ecstasy					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Prophet of Erathaol Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Once per day per class level, a prophet of Erathaol can enter an ecstatic state, allowing a celestial to seize control of her mind and speech. This is sort of a lesser version of channeling celestials (as described in Chapter 2), in which the prophet simply becomes helpless for 1 round while a celestial speaks through her. What the celestial says (and who it is) is entirely up to the DM, though it is always at least tangentially relevant to whatever matter is at hand. As a rule of thumb, this ability can have one of the following effects: . any Knowledge check (with a bonus equal to the prophet's character level +5) . a bardic knowledge check (with a bonus equal to the prophet's character level +5) . a divination spell . a detect evil spell . an enthrall spell (the prophet can continue speaking on her own after the 1 round of ecstasy, continuing the effect) . a good hope spell . an atonement spell . like a phylactery of faithfulness, allowing the prophet to identify evil creatures and avoid evil acts . if the prophet sacrifices 500 XP, a commune spell Unfortunately, at the instant a prophet of Erathaol cedes control of her mind and invites a celestial to take it, she is vulnerable to possession by less beneficent spirits. If a fiend or ghost capable of possession is in ethereal form, within 30 feet of the prophet, and not flat-footed when a prophet enters her ecstasy, the creature can attempt to possess her immediately. The prophet takes a -2 penalty on her Will save to resist the possession, and if she fails she is not aware of the creature's presence in her body. The creature prevents a celestial from entering, and might pretend to be the celestial, speaking as the prophet's companions expect. If the creature chooses not to make its presence known in this way, it seems as though the ecstasy simply fails.	SOURCEPAGE:p.67

SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Spells				KEY:Slayer of Domiel ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Slayer of Domiel Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:A slayer of Domiel has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a slayer of Domiel spell, the slayer must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a slayer of Domiel with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Slayer of Domiel bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the slayer's Wisdom modifier. When the slayer of Domiel gets 0 spells of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st level slayer of Domiel), she gets only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. The slayer of Domiel's spell list appears below. A slayer of Domiel prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a slayer cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Death Touch				KEY:Slayer of Domiel ~ Death Touch					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Slayer of Domiel Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:A slayer of Domiel can slay living evil opponents with a single touch. She must succeed on a melee touch attack against the target. When she touches, she rolls 1d6 per slayer level. If the total at least equals the target's current hit points, it dies. This is a death effect, and it has no effect on nonevil creatures. A slayer of Domiel can use this ability more often as she increases in levels, as shown on Table 5-17.

Sneak Attack			KEY:Slayer of Domiel ~ Sneak Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Slayer of Domiel Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:If a slayer of Domiel can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time a slayer's target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the slayer's attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and an additional 1d6 at every two slayer levels thereafter (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). Should a slayer of Domiel score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap or an unarmed strike, a slayer of Domiel can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the sneak attack. A slayer of Domiel can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies-undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A slayer of Domiel cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach. If a slayer of Domiel gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the extra damage stacks.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.74

Scent of Evil			KEY:Stalker of Kharash ~ Scent of Evil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Stalker of Kharash Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A stalker of Kharash has an unusual ability that combines the scent special quality with the detect evil spell. The stalker can detect evil opponents within 30 feet by their scent of evil. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. A strong aura of evil (an evil outsider or evil cleric of 5-10 HD, an evil elemental or undead of 10-21 HD, an evil creature of 25-54 HD, or an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of 10-21) can be detected at twice these ranges. An overwhelming aura of evil (an evil outsider or evil cleric with 11 HD or more, an evil elemental or undead with 22 HD or more, an evil creature with 55 HD or more, or an evil magic item or spell with a caster level of 22 or higher) can be detected at triple normal range.

Track Evil				KEY:Stalker of Kharash ~ Track Evil					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Stalker of Kharash Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:A 5th-level stalker can use the Track feat to track an evil creature by its lingering evil aura, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). The DC for tracking a normal aura increases by 2 every 10 minutes, for tracking a strong aura by 2 every hour, and for tracking an overwhelming aura by 2 every day. This ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. The stalker can ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Spells				KEY:Vassal of Bahamut ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Vassal of Bahamut Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a vassal of Bahamut gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a spell, the vassal must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a vassal with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Vassal of Bahamut bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the vassal's Wisdom bonus. When the vassal gets 0 spells of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 2nd-level vassal of Bahamut), he gets only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell. The vassal of Bahamut's spell list appears below. A vassal of Bahamut prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a beloved cannot spontaneously cast cure spells).

Bonus Feat				KEY:Vassal of Bahamut ~ Bonus Feat					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Vassal of Bahamut Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At 3rd level, and again at 6th and 9th level, a vassal of Bahamut gains a bonus feat. This feat must be drawn from the following list, and the vassal must meet all the prerequisites for the feat: Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Exalted Smite*, Gift of Faith*, Gift of Grace*, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Hands of a Healer*, Holy Radiance*, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun, Improved Sunder, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Negotiator, Nemesis*, Nimbus of Light*, Persuasive, Power Attack, Righteous Wrath*, Sanctify Weapon*, Weapon Focus. *New feat described in Chapter 4 of this book.

Dragonwrack				KEY:Vassal of Bahamut ~ Dragonwrack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Vassal of Bahamut Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Evil dragons that strike a vassal of Bahamut or are struck by him suffer grievous wounds. At 4th level, a vassal of Bahamut deals +2d6 points of damage with each successful melee attack made against an evil creature of the dragon type. Furthermore, any such creature that strikes the vassal with a natural weapon or melee weapon takes 1d6 points of damage. In both cases, half of the extra damage is permanent hit point drain. A dragon that survives a battle against a vassal of Bahamut often bears terrible scars from the permanent drain of hit points. Only a wish or miracle spell can restore hit points drained permanently by a vassal's dragonwrack ability. At 7th level, the vassal deals +3d6 points of damage to evil dragons, and a dragon that strikes the vassal takes 1d6 points of damage. Again, in both cases, half of this damage is permanent drain. At 10th level, the damage increases to +4d6 points and 2d6 points, respectively.

Bonus Exalted Feat		KEY:Wonderworker ~ Bonus Exalted Feat				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wonderworker Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:At every level, a wonderworker gets a bonus exalted feat.

Bonus Spells per Day		KEY:Wonderworker ~ Bonus Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wonderworker Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:For each level of wonderworker that a spellcasting character attains, he gains bonus spells to the number of spells per day he normally casts. These bonus spells can be added to whatever levels of spells the wonderworker can currently cast, but no more than one can be added to the character's highest current spell level. Arcane spellcasters (bards, sorcerers, and wizards) receive fewer bonus spells than divine spellcasters (clerics and druids), as shown on the table above. For example, a 9th-level cleric who takes a single level in wonderworker can give himself one bonus 5th-level spell (his highest as a 9th-level cleric), and one bonus spell in one other level, 0 through 4th. A 9thlevel wizard who takes a level in wonderworker gains only one bonus spell, which she can give herself in any level, 0 through 5th. A psion who adopts the wonderworker class receives bonus power points/day equal to one-half of the sum of his psion level and his wonderworker level. A psychic warrior/wonderworker receives bonus power points/day equal to one-third of the sum of her psychic warrior level and her wonderworker level. If a wonderworker has two spellcasting or psionic classes already, he must give the bonus spell or power points to a class in which he can cast at least 3rd-level spells or manifest at least 3rd-level powers. If more than one class meets that requirement, he must choose which previous class gains the bonus. He cannot split bonus spells or power points between two different spellcasting or psionic classes. For example, a 5th-level cleric/5th-level wizard takes one level of wonderworker. He can either take 2 bonus cleric spells or 1 bonus wizard spell, but he cannot take 1 of each. Once a wonderworker has chosen how to apply his bonus spells or power points, they cannot be shifted.																SOURCEPAGE:p.82

The Regalia of Good	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:Resonating Effect (Two Items): While a single character possesses two items of the Regalia of Good, he gains the benefits of the Spell Focus (Good), Gift of Faith, Nimbus of Light, and Words of Creation feats. As the character's nature alters to reflect the celestial energies that surround the regalia, he gains a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against electricity, petrification, cold, acid, fire, and poison. The character gains low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Finally, if the wielder casts a planar ally spell (including the lesser and greater versions) to call a celestial, the creature serves for half the price it would normally charge, in goods or services (at the DM's discretion).	DESC:Resonating Effect (Three Items): While a single creature possesses all three items of the Regalia of Good, he gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. Any weapon wielded by the creature becomes a holy weapon, dealing an extra +2d6 points of damage to evil creatures. In addition, the wielder radiates an aura of courage, granting all his allies within 30 feet a +4 morale bonus on their saving throws to resist fear effects.|PREEQUIP:3,TYPE=RegaliaOfGood

Natural Weapons			KEY:Sword Archon ~ Natural Weapons		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Sword Archon Race Trait.SpecialQuality			DESC:A sword archon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as having the good and lawful alignments for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.161
Armblades				KEY:Sword Archon ~ Armblades			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Sword Archon Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:As a free action, a sword archon can mold the flesh of its forearms, hardening and sharpening organic matter into the form of powerful magic blades. The archon wields the blades like longswords, and they gain the properties of +2 holy flaming longswords. Sword archons can shift back to their "normal" hands as a free action. The armblades cannot be disarmed or sundered, and they automatically assume limb form upon the archon's death.																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.161
Discorporating Dive		KEY:Sword Archon ~ Discorporating Dive	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Sword Archon Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Three times per day, a sword archon can attempt to destroy a living enemy with a powerful dive attack, literally flying through its opponent armblades-first, tearing apart its body and sending its soul to imprisonment in the Seven Heavens. Resolve a flying charge as normal. If the archon fails to damage its opponent, the discorporating dive attack is wasted. If damaged, however, the target must make a DC 17 Fortitude save. Those who succeed on the Fortitude save suffer no further effect beyond the damage of the attack. If the save fails, the attack utterly annihilates the victim's body, killing it instantly. Further, the victim's soul is bound to a great prison in the Seven Heavens of Celestia, where it remains until the archons that manage the celestial donjon see fit to release it. Release generally involves bartering with a throne archon (see Chapter 7: Celestial Paragons), with some quest for the cause of law and goodness being the most common price. Such agents of Heaven never release the soul of an unredeemed evil creature.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.161
