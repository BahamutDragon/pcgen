The amber sarcophagus has hardness 5 and 10 hp per caster level (maximum 200 hp). If it is reduced to 0 hp, it shatters and crumbles to worthless amber dust, at which point the target is released from stasis (although it is flatfooted until its next turn).

At the end of the spell's duration, all summoned celestials disappear at once. The celestials only heed the summons if the caster is of good alignment and there are evil foes to fight. After their arrival, the celestials obey the caster explicitly and never attack her, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. The caster does not need to concentrate to maintain control over the celestials. She can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time. Sacrifice: 1 character level.

The light is similar to that created by the daylight spell, but no magical darkness counters or dispels it. Furthermore, evil-aligned creatures are blinded within this light. Blinding glory brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa), including an utterdark spell, is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

Once per round, as a standard action, the target can deal 2d6 points of fire damage to any single creature or object within 60 feet, simply by gazing at it (no attack roll required). Horns of the Cervidal: Ramlike horns sprout from the target's head. The target can charge an opponent with its deadly horns. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this tactic allows the creature to make a single gore attack that deals 1d8 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times the target's Strength modifier. Any summoned or called creature struck by the horns is dismissed instantly. Wings of the Astral Deva: Angelic wings sprout from the target's back, allowing the target to fly at a speed of 100 feet (good). Although these attributes change the target's appearance, other celestials do not recognize the target as a celestial being (unless the target happens to be one). If the creature tries to disguise itself as a celestial, consult the Player's Handbook for the appropriate Disguise check DC. Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength damage.
Celestial Blood						CLASSES:Apostle of Peace,Cleric=6									DOMAINS:Pleasure=6		SCHOOL:Abjuration						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, M				CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Nonevil creature touched												DURATION:1 minute/level					SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:You channel holy power to grant the subject some of the protection enjoyed by celestial creatures.

Creatures with light sensitivity take twice the usual penalty when they are within 60 feet of the object. Undead creatures take 1d6 points of damage each round they are within the bright light. Evil outsiders, as well as undead creatures that are specifically harmed by sunlight, take 2d6 points of damage each round in the bright light.

Distilled Joy						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3										DOMAINS:Joy=3			SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S, F				CASTTIME:1 day			RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One living creature												DURATION:Permanent					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:You draw forth the material essence of joy from a creature experiencing great bliss. This physical manifestation of joy, called ambrosia, can be used in the creation of good magic items, as a special spell component, or as a druglike substance (with no addictive qualities). The Celestial Hebdomad, the rulers of the Seven Heavens, subsist entirely on ambrosia. The caster draws ambrosia from the target and contains it within a tiny receptacle, such as a vial. Ambrosia can only be drawn from a blissful creature; how the creature achieves this state of bliss can vary from one individual to the next. For example, distilled joy can be cast on a deliriously lovestruck character, a dryad dreaming near her tree, an artist crafting his life's masterpiece, or a character experiencing a moment of rapture or undiluted sexual pleasure. Good spellcasters can use ambrosia in magic item creation. Each dose provides the equivalent of 2 experience points needed to create the item. A dose of ambrosia can also be used as an optional spell component (see Chapter 3). A living creature that drinks a dose of ambrosia experiences a soothing sensation that wipes away minor aches and pains, takes the edge off grief and sadness, and cures 1 point of damage. These positive sensations and emotions persist for 1d4+1 hours. Focus: A vial or similar container in which to contain the ambrosia.

Creatures inside or passing through a cloud of dolorous motes must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. A new save may be made each round. Leaving and then re-entering a cloud of motes forces a new save. The caster can create one large cloud of flickering motes or several smaller clouds. For example, a 5th-level caster could create five separate clouds, each filling a 10-foot cube anywhere within the spell's range. Conversely, the caster can group one or more 10-foot-cubes together to form larger clouds or barriers. The affected cubes need not be adjacent to one another, but each cloud is stationary once placed. Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Wisdom damage.
Dragon Cloud			TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=8																	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Calling		DESCRIPTOR:Air						COMPS:V, S, Sacrifice			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Special (see text)			TARGETAREA:One conjured dragon cloud (see text)										DURATION:1 min. + 1 minute/level			SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.97	DESC:You must cast this spell outdoors, in a place where clouds are visible. It calls forth a spirit of elemental air, binds it to a nearby cloud (either a normal cloud or storm cloud), and gives it a dragonlike form. Upon forming, the dragon-shaped cloud swoops toward you, arriving in 1 minute regardless of the actual distance from you. (The time it takes to reach you counts toward the spell's duration.) Once it arrives, you can command the dragon cloud like a summoned creature (see the summon nature's ally I spell in the Player's Handbook for details). The dragon cloud speaks Auran. At the end of the spell's duration, the dragon cloud evaporates into nothingness as the bound elemental spirit returns to its home plane.

It does not heal any damage or other effects not directly related to pain. If the target creature is under some effect that causes continuing damage, the pain is eased only for a moment. Ease pain cannot bypass the need for a Concentration check to cast a spell under such circumstances, nor can it allow a creature subject to death by thorns to act normally (since the spell's damage is ongoing).

All intelligent creatures within the spell's area suddenly become aware that any hostile actions they take will be met with dire consequences. Any creature in the spell's area that makes an attack takes 20d6 points of damage.

First, it renders the target immune to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) specified when the spell is cast. Second, whenever the target is subjected to a magical attack of the selected energy type, he instead heals damage equal to 10%% of the damage dealt (rounded down). For example, a creature protected by energetic healing (cold) that would normally take 35 points of cold damage from a cone of cold heals 3 points of damage instead. Once the spell heals a number of hit points equal to 2 per caster level (maximum 30), it is discharged. This spell does not convert nonmagical energy attacks (such as damage from alchemist's fire) into healing.

The caster must specify the energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) when the spell is cast. The potion deals 1d6 points of damage (of the appropriate energy type) per spell level of the potion (maximum 3d6).

Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and disintegration, are not affected. If a subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between you and the subjects, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subjects. If you die while this spell is in effect, the spell ends in a burst of positive energy that restores 1d8 hit points to each subject.

In addition, the armor's brightness causes opponents to take a -4 to penalty on melee attacks made against the target. This penalty stacks with the attack penalty suffered by creatures sensitive to bright light (such as dark elves). Sacrifice: 1d2 points of Strength damage.

You and your mount gain a +4 flanking bonus on attack rolls (instead of +2) when the two of you are flanking the same opponent.

If the spell or effect did not originally permit a saving throw, this spell has no effect.
Path of the Exalted		TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=3																	SCHOOL:Divination														COMPS:V, Abstinence			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal																						DURATION:1 decision; see text																					SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:Path of the exalted allows the caster to consult her deity (or an agent of her deity) to help make a difficult decision. This decision is usually more complex than a simple morality question. It may involve strategizing, choosing a particular lead to follow in an investigation, deciding who to help, or other difficult choices. The deity or agent simply helps the character examine a known situation from a number of different angles and makes a recommendation about the correct path to take. This spell does not reveal unknown factors, but merely helps the caster analyze known elements. The spell ends when the deity or agent has provided sufficient guidance for the caster to arrive at a decision. If the caster is out of favor with her deity, this spell may not work until the caster atones. Abstinence Component: The caster must abstain from casting Divination spells for 24 hours prior to the casting of this spell.
Perfect Summons						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4															SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:40-ft.-radius spread												DURATION:1 hour/level					SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.103	DESC:You create an area in which only good creatures can be magically summoned. No matter what a later caster attempts to summon, he actually summons a good version (a celestial beast rather than a fiendish one, for example) or a good equivalent (an archon rather than a formian). If the summoner was attempting to summon a neutral or evil creature, the good creature that appears is not bound to obey the commands of the summoner or attack his enemies. Instead, it deals with the summoner as it sees fit-possibly attacking an evil caster. The summoning spell cannot be dismissed, though it can be dispelled. A perfect summons spell can also be dispelled normally. Perfect summons counters and dispels distort summons (which appears in Book of Vile Darkness), and vice versa.

You die (no saving throw, and spell resistance does not apply). Every evil creature within the cloud takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6). Neutral characters take half damage (and a successful Reflex save reduces that further in half ), while good characters take no damage at all. Half of the damage dealt by the spell against any creature is fire; the rest results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield), and similar magic. After 10 minutes, you rise from the ashes as if restored to life by a resurrection spell. Focus: A tail feather from a phoenix, worth 40 gp. Sacrifice: Your death and the level you lose when you return to life are the sacrifice cost for this spell.
Quickshift							CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=6														SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, Celestial			CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:1 round/level																						SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:For the duration of this spell, the caster's teleport or greater teleport spelllike ability is quickened (as if enhanced with the Quicken Spell feat).

Creatures within the cloud must make successful Fortitude saves or be dazzled, taking a -1 penalty on attack rolls for as long as they remain in the cloud and for 1 minute afterward. Creatures with light sensitivity or otherwise susceptible to bright light are blinded if they fail their saves. Sightless creatures are not affected by the radiance. Spell resistance applies to the reduced movement, melee attack and damage penalties, and dazzling or blinding effects, but not to the concealment provided or the prevention of ranged weapon attacks. Abstinence Component: You must not have cast a darkness or Necromancy spell within the past 24 hours before casting this spell.
Radiant Shield						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4										DOMAINS:Wrath=4			SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Electricity|Good				COMPS:V, S, Abstinence			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:1 round/level (D)																					SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:A scintillating aura of white radiance wreathes you and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The radiance also protects you from electricity attacks. Any creature striking you with a natural or handheld weapons deals normal damage but also takes 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point per caster level (the creature's spell resistance applies). You take only half damage from electricity- based attacks. If an electricitybased attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. The radiance is as bright as a light spell, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and shadowy illumination to 20 feet. Abstinence Component: You must not have cast a darkness or Necromancy spell within the last 24 hours before casting this spell.
Rain of Black Tulips					CLASSES:Druid=9																	SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, M				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long						TARGETAREA:Cylinder (80-ft. radius, 80 ft. high)									DURATION:1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None (damage) and Fortitude negates (nausea)			SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:Tulips as black as midnight fall from the sky. The tulips explode with divine energy upon striking evil creatures, each of which takes 5d6 points of damage. In addition, evil creatures that fail a Fortitude save are nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, perform any task requiring concentration, or take anything other than a single move action per turn) until they leave the spell's area. A successful Fortitude save renders a creature immune to the nauseating effect of the tulips, but not the damage. Material Component: A black tulip.
Rain of Embers			TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=7																	SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Fire|Good					COMPS:V, S, Sacrifice			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium					TARGETAREA:Cylinder (40-ft. radius, 120 ft. high)									DURATION:1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text						SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:This spell causes orange, starlike embers to rain steadily from above. Each round, the falling embers deal 10d6 points of damage to evil creatures within the spell's area. Half of the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield), and similar magic. Creatures may leave the area to avoid taking additional damage, but a new saving throw is required each round a creature is caught in the fiery downpour. A shield provides a cover bonus on the Reflex save, depending on its size: small +2, large +4, tower +7. A shield spell oriented upward provides a +4 cover bonus on the Reflex save. A creature using its shield (or shield spell) to block the rain of embers cannot use it for defense in combat. Sacrifice: 1d2 points of Strength drain.
Rain of Roses						CLASSES:Druid=7																	SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, M				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long						TARGETAREA:Cylinder (80-ft. radius, 80 ft. high)									DURATION:1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None (ability damage) and Fortitude negates (sickening)	SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:Red roses fall from the sky. Their sharp thorns graze the flesh of evil creatures, dealing 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage per round. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom falls unconscious as its mind succumbs to horrible nightmares. In addition, the beautiful rose petals sicken evil creatures touched by them; those that fail a Fortitude save are sickened (-2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks) until they leave the spell's area. A successful Fortitude save renders a creature immune to the sickening effect of the roses, but not the ability damage caused by their thorns. Material Component: A red rose.

Since the spell's duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent new addiction to the same drug at a later date.
Remove Fatigue						CLASSES:Apostle of Peace,Cleric=4									DOMAINS:Pleasure=4		SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:S					CASTTIME:10 minutes		RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Up to one living creature touched per two levels								DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)					SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:The creatures you touch gain the benefits of 8 hours of restful sleep. If a subject was fatigued, the fatigue and its penalties are removed. If a subject was exhausted, the exhaustion becomes fatigue, but the subject only needs to rest for 1 more hour to eliminate the fatigue. If a subject was already well rested, it does not need to rest or sleep during the next 24 hours. Arcane spellcasters must still rest their minds for 8 hours in order to prepare or ready their spells.

Upon completion of the casting, the disintegrated item returns to the possession of the original owner in the condition it was in before being disintegrated.

Evil creatures with 5 HD or fewer within 60 feet of you must make a successful Will save or die. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a fear spell for 2d10 rounds. Neutral (neither good nor evil) creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a Will save or suffer the fear effect.

The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to evil creatures (or 1d8 points of damage per caster level, maximum 20d8, to evil outsiders) and blinds them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinding effect. The spell deals only half damage against creatures that are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. They can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.
Sacred Guardian						CLASSES:Apostle of Peace,Cleric=5														SCHOOL:Divination														COMPS:V, S, Celestial			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Object or willing creature touched										DURATION:1 day/level					SAVEINFO:None (see text)							SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:Celestials use sacred guardian to monitor the location and condition of a creature or object that has been placed in their care. Similar to status, this spell makes the caster constantly aware of the target creature or object's precise location and status: whether a creature is unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, dead, and so on, or whether an object is unharmed, damaged, or destroyed. Once the spell is cast, the distance between the caster and the subject does not affect the spell, and the spell continues to function even if the subject and caster are on different planes of existence. If the caster wishes to teleport to the subject's presence, he can do so even if he is not familiar with the location (assuming he has access to teleportation magic). If the caster casts scrying or greater scrying on the subject, the subject does not receive a saving throw; unless the subject is warded by a spell or in a location that blocks scrying magic, the spell automatically succeeds. This spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. If the target is an attended object, the attending creature must be willing for the object to receive the spell.
Sacred Haven						CLASSES:Paladin=4																	SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S, DF				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Creature touched													DURATION:1 minute/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)						SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:You shield one creature in a nimbus of holy light. The creature gains a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class. In addition, while protected by this spell, the creature does not lose its Dexterity bonus to AC when flat-footed. For the duration of the spell, you gain awareness of the target's health as with the status spell, and you need not be able to touch the target to heal it with your lay on hands ability. Use of the lay on hands ability still requires a standard action, but it can be done at any range provided the target is on the same plane of existence as you.
Sanctify the Wicked		TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=9																	SCHOOL:Necromancy						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, F, Sacrifice		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One evil creature													DURATION:See text						SAVEINFO:Will negates								SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.106	DESC:This spell tears the foul, corrupted soul from the body of an evil creature and traps it in a diamond receptacle (the spell's focus). The creature's soulless body instantly withers or molders into dust. Trapped in the gem, the evil soul undergoes a gradual transformation. The soul reflects on past evils and slowly finds within itself a spark of goodness. Over time, this spark grows into a burning fire. After one year, the trapped creature's soul adopts the alignment of the spell's caster (lawful good, chaotic good, or neutral good). Once the soul's penitence is complete, shattering the diamond reforms the creature's original body, returns the creature's soul to it, and transforms the whole into a sanctified creature (see Chapter 8: Monsters). If the diamond is shattered before the soul has found penitence, the evil creature's body and soul are fully restored; the creature's state is just as it was before the spell was cast. The creature retains the memory of having been trapped in the gem, and it regards the spell's caster as a hated enemy who must be destroyed at all costs. The diamond receptacle has a hardness of 20 and 1 hit point. Focus: A flawless diamond worth no less than 10,000 gp. Sacrifice: 1 character level.

The corpse must be within range of the spell, in which case it is transformed into divine energy. The energy is then drawn into the holy symbol, and the corpse is placed in stasis (as the gentle repose spell) for the duration of the spell. The caster can release the corpse from the holy symbol by dismissing the spell. If the spell ends or is dismissed, or if the holy symbol is destroyed, the contained corpse materializes in a square adjacent to the holy symbol's present or last location.
Shield of the Archons					CLASSES:Apostle of Peace,Cleric=7														SCHOOL:Abjuration						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, Archon				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You	TARGETAREA:Mobile shield										DURATION:1 round/level																						SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:A mystic shield of beneficent energies interposes itself between you an incoming magical attack. The shield blocks harmful spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. It can only block one such attack each round, intercepting the first but not any later attacks until your next turn. Any targeted magical attack that strikes the shield is dissipated, but it has a 5%% chance per spell level to shatter the shield as well. Attacks with no spell level have a 5%% chance per 2 caster levels to shatter the shield. An attack that shatters the shield is dissipated without harming you. If you are within the area or effect of a harmful spell or effect that is not directly targeted on you, the shield of the archons grants you a +4 bonus on your saving throw against the effect.

The spell affects slam attacks, fist or claw attacks, bite attacks, and any other natural weapons the target creature possesses. The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage, however. Silvered claws can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Silvered Weapon						CLASSES:Paladin=1|Ranger=2															SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One weapon or projectile touched										DURATION:1 round/level					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (object, harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes (object, harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:This spell transforms a single weapon or projectile you are holding into a silvered weapon. The weapon may be magical, masterwork, or nonmagical, but it must be in hand when the spell is cast. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see silvered claws). The spell cannot be cast on more than one weapon or on multiple projectiles. If the weapon targeted by the spell is made of another special material (cold iron or adamantine, for example), it loses the benefits of its original special material for the spell's duration. Silvered weapon can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Smite Heretic						CLASSES:Paladin=3																	SCHOOL:Conjuration													COMPS:V, S, DF				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:10 minutes/level																					SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:For the duration of the spell, when using your smite evil class ability against an evil creature with the ability to cast divine spells, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on the attack roll. Furthermore, the attack deals 2 extra points of damage (instead of 1) per Paladin=level.
Spear of Valarian						CLASSES:Beloved of Valarian,Ranger=4|Druid=5												SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One nonmagical weapon touched											DURATION:1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (object, harmless)				SPELLRES:Yes (object, harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:The spear of Valarian spell transforms one nonmagical weapon into a shimmering silver spear. You must be carrying the weapon and have it drawn for the spell to work. The shimmering spear functions as a +1 silvered spear. Against magical beasts, the weapon becomes a +3 silvered spear that deals +2d6 points of bonus damage (as the bane special property). If the spear of Valarian is sundered, the original weapon breaks as the spell suddenly ends. If the wielder relinquishes the spear, willingly or not, it immediately reverts to its previous state and the spell ends.

Hostile and unfriendly creatures become indifferent, indifferent creatures turn friendly, and friendly creatures become helpful for the spell's duration. This spell directly counters the effects of the spread of savagery spell (described in the Book of Vile Darkness). This spell also calms creatures that have been otherwise magically enraged and forced to attack. This spell does not calm or otherwise alter the dispositions of summoned creatures. Material Component: Lammasu's feather.
Starmantle							CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6										DOMAINS:Joy=7			SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S, M				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One living creature touched											DURATION:1 minute/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:This spell manifests as a draping cloak of tiny, cascading stars that seem to flicker out before touching the ground. The cloak forms over the target's existing apparel and sheds light as a torch, although this is not the mantle's primary function. The starmantle renders the wearer impervious to nonmagical weapon attacks and transforms any nonmagical weapon or missile that strikes it into harmless light, destroying it forever. Contact with the starmantle does not destroy magic weapons or missiles, but the starmantle's wearer is entitled to a Reflex saving throw (DC 15) each time he is struck by such a weapon; success indicates that the wearer takes only half damage from the weapon (rounded down). Material Component: A pinch of dust from a pixie's wing (20 gp).
Stars of Arvandor						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3|Cleric,Druid,Ranger=4												SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force|Good					COMPS:V, S					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:Up to one creature or object per round									DURATION:1 minute/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:You create one tiny, twinkling star per level (maximum 10 stars). These minute starbursts orbit your head like ioun stones. As a free action, you can launch one star per round at a target your designate within range. Alternatively, as a standard action, you may launch up to three stars per round at one or more targets within range. Each star requires its own ranged touch attack roll. A nonevil target takes 1d8 points of damage, half of which is nonlethal (round down). Evil targets take 1d8 points of lethal damage instead. The stars are magical force, so they ignore incorporeality.
Storm of Shards			TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=6																	SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, Sacrifice			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:0 ft.						TARGETAREA:80-ft.-radius spread												DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (blinding) and Reflex half (shards)	SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:Shards of heavenly light rain down from above. Evil creatures within the spell's area that fail a Fortitude save are blinded permanently. The light shards also slice the flesh of evil creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). A successful Reflex save halves the damage, which is of divine origin. Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength drain.
Sublime Revelry						CLASSES:Cleric=9												DOMAINS:Pleasure=9		SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S, DF				CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart					DURATION:1 minute/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:Sublime revelry immediately removes any lingering effects of pain, including penalties imposed by symbol of pain, angry ache, and similar spells. It does not prevent damage or block other effects not directly related to pain. The spell also induces a pleasurable fuguelike state that yields the following additional effects: First, sublime revelry renders its targets immune to mind-affecting spells and effects for the spell's duration, as well as suppresses (but not dispels) ones currently in effect. Second, targets of the spell take only half damage from all melee and ranged attacks for the duration of the spell.
Sunmantle				TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=4																	SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:S, Sacrifice			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One creature touched												DURATION:1 round/level					SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:This spell cloaks the target in a wavering cloak of light that illuminates an area around the target (and dispels darkness) as a daylight spell. However, its ability to generate bright light is not the spell's primary function. The sunmantle grants the target damage reduction 5/-. Furthermore, if the target is struck by a melee attack that deals hit point damage, a tendril of light lashes out at the attacker, striking unerringly and dealing 5 points of damage. Because of the brilliance of the sunmantle, creatures sensitive to bright light (such as dark elves) take the usual attack penalties when in the light radius of the sunmantle. Sacrifice: 1d4 points of Strength damage.
Sustain							CLASSES:Apostle of Peace,Cleric=4									DOMAINS:Endurance=4		SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S, M				CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Up to one living creature touched/two levels								DURATION:6 hours/level					SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:This spell instantly relieves the negative effects of hunger and thirst and allows the targets to go without food or water for the duration of the spell, suffering no ill effects from the deprivation. An affected creature can eat or drink normally without difficulty. When the spell ends, the creatures must resume normal eating and drinking habits, but do not feel any adverse effects from the missed meals. The size of the creature is not a factor; a Tiny lizard and a Colossal dragon are both fully nourished by the spell. Material Component: A flask of warm wine and a loaf of bread.
Sword of Conscience							CLASSES:Champion of Gwynharwyf,Cleric,Exalted Arcanist,Paladin,Slayer of Domiel=4						SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Good|Mind-Affecting			COMPS:V, DF					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One evil creature													DURATION:Instantaneous; see text			SAVEINFO:Will negates								SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:The target creature, which must be evil, is struck by pangs of conscience and remorse. The creature instantaneously takes Wisdom and Charisma damage according to the magnitude of its evil. The creature regains lost abilities normally; they do not automatically return when the spell's duration expires. This effect is not language-dependent.
Telepathy Block						CLASSES:Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=5													SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:80-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space			DURATION:1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.108	DESC:This spell blocks all telepathic communication within the affected area, making telepathic conversation impossible. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary. The spell can be centered on a creature or mobile object, in which case the effect emanates from the creature or object and moves as it moves. Consequences of Sword of Conscience --Wisdom and Charisma Damage-- Creature/Object 1d6 1d8 2d6 2d8 Evil creature1 (HD) 10 or lower 11-25 26-50 51+ Evil elemental 2 or lower 3-8 9-20 21+ or undead (HD) Evil outsider (HD) 1 or lower 2-4 5-10 11+ Cleric=of an evil deity2 1 2-4 5-10 11+ (class levels) 1 Except for evil elementals, undead, and outsiders, which have their own entries on the table. 2 Some characters who are not clerics may radiate an aura of equivalent power. The class description will indicate whether this applies.
Telepathy Tap			TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=3																	SCHOOL:Divination														COMPS:Sacrifice				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:10-ft./level-radius emanation											DURATION:1 round/level (D)				SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:You can overhear the telepathic conversations of other creatures within the spell's area. Telepathy tap does not allow you to detect the uncommunicated thoughts of creatures or understand conversations spoken in languages you do not comprehend. In an area where numerous telepathic conversations are occurring at the same time, you must specify the creatures you wish to overhear during a given round. You can separate and decipher the telepathic messages of a number of creatures equal to 1 + your Intelligence bonus. Telepathy tap does not allow you to overhear the telepathic conversations of creatures protected by a mind blank spell, nor does it grant the ability to telepathically communicate with other creatures. Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength damage.
Tomb of Light						CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=7														SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, M				CASTTIME:1 round			RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Evil extraplanar creature touched										DURATION:Concentration					SAVEINFO:Fortitude partial							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:When you cast this spell, you attempt to draw out the impure substance of an evil extraplanar creature and replace it with your own pure substance. The spell is draining for you to cast, but it is deadly to evil outsiders and other extraplanar creatures with the taint of evil. When you touch the target creature, it must make a Fortitude saving throw. If it succeeds, it is unaffected by the spell. If it fails, its skin becomes translucent and faintly radiant and the creature is immobilized, standing helpless. The subject is aware and breathes normally, but cannot take any physical actions, even speech. It can, however, execute purely mental actions (such as using a spell-like ability). The effect is similar to hold person. Each round you maintain the spell, the creature must attempt another Fortitude save. If it fails the save, it takes 1d6 points of permanent Constitution drain. Each round you maintain the spell, however, you take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. If you fall unconscious, or if the creature succeeds at its Fortitude save, the spell ends. Material Component: A pure crystal or clear gemstone worth at least 50 gp.
Touch of Adamantine					CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5|Cleric,Druid=6													SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Weapon touched													DURATION:1 minute/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates (object, harmless)					SPELLRES:Yes (object, harmless)	SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:This spell grants one weapon the properties of an adamantine weapon. The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls (as though it was a masterwork weapon) and bypasses hardness when striking objects or sundering weapons, ignoring hardness less than 20. The affected weapon also has one-third more hit points than normal for the duration of the spell. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell. If the weapon is made of another special material (cold iron or silver, for example), it loses the benefits of its original special material for the spell's duration. Touch of adamantine cannot be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Twilight Luck			TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=1																	SCHOOL:Abjuration						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, Abstinence			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:One nonevil creature touched											DURATION:1 minute/level					SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)			SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:By means of this spell, the caster can impart the luck of the fey to one nonevil being. The target gains a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws for the duration of the spell. Abstinence: The caster must refrain from imbibing alcohol for 3 days prior to casting this spell.
Unearthly Beauty							CLASSES:Druid=8									DOMAINS:Fey=8			SCHOOL:Transmutation					DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, Abstinence				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal					TARGETAREA:You															DURATION:1 round/level																						SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:As blinding beauty, but at any time during the duration of the spell, you can evoke an additional effect as a free action. When you choose, any creature within 30 feet of you that is looking directly at you must succeed on a Will save or die. Abstinence Component: You must abstain from sexual intercourse for one month before casting this spell.
Valiant Steed			TYPE:Sanctified	CLASSES:ALL=6																	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Calling		DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, Sacrifice			CASTTIME:1 hour			RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:Calls 1 pegasus or unicorn											DURATION:Instantaneous; see text			SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.110	DESC:The caster calls a special servant of the exalted god Valarian-either a pegasus or unicorn-to her location. The creature serves the caster for up to a year, during which time the caster may dismiss it at any time. It is intelligent, so the caster can assign it complex tasks. Although useful as a mount, it will not undertake a quest or otherwise take on complex burdens beyond the supervision of the caster. If the caster attempts to conjure another creature using this spell, the one called previously returns to its home. Sacrifice: 1d3 points of Strength drain.
Vanishing Weapon						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5															SCHOOL:Abjuration														COMPS:V, S					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Weapon touched													DURATION:1 minute/level					SAVEINFO:None; see text								SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:This spell encapsulates a weapon in a faint blue glow. In addition to dealing normal damage, the weapon dispels on contact any summoned creature or quasireal creature brought into being by a Conjuration (summoning) or Illusion (shadow) spell. This requires a successful dispel check (1d20 + caster's level) against DC 11 + the level of the caster who summoned or created the creature. If the vanishing weapon is a ranged weapon, the spell's effect is imparted to the weapon's ammunition. A summoned or quasi-real creature goaded into touching the vanishing weapon is also dispelled. This spell has no effect on called creatures.
Vengeance Halo						CLASSES:Cleric=6												DOMAINS:Wrath=6			SCHOOL:Abjuration						DESCRIPTOR:Good						COMPS:V, S, DF, Abstinence		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One good-aligned creature; see text										DURATION:1 minute/level					SAVEINFO:None or Reflex half; see text					SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:A luminous ring of holy power appears above the head of a good creature and remains in place until the spell expires or the creature is slain (reduced to -10 hp). If the latter event occurs, the halo discharges an arc of divine energy that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the target's slayer. The creature subject to the attack can make a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. Once the vengeance halo unleashes its energy, it disappears and the spell ends. Abstinence Component: You must abstain from alcohol for 1 week prior to casting this spell.
Vision of Heaven						CLASSES:Apostle of Peace,Cleric,Exalted Arcanist,Slayer of Domiel=1			DOMAINS:Celestial,Joy=1		SCHOOL:Enchantment					DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				COMPS:V					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One evil creature													DURATION:1 round						SAVEINFO:Will negates								SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:Your words allow the target creature the merest glimpse of the blessed joy of the Seven Heavens, spurring the target to a moment of regret for its evil deeds. For 1 round, the target is dazed. In addition, the creature is more susceptible to future redemption. For the next 24 hours, the creature takes a -1 penalty on all Will saves related to redemption (see Chapter 2).
Wages of Sin						CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6															SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Good|Mind-Affecting			COMPS:V, Abstinence			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft/level)	TARGETAREA:One evil creature/level												DURATION:1 round/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates								SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:The affected creatures' own evil thoughts and impulses blossom in their minds into intense suspicion and distrust. Each subject becomes convinced that its own allies are plotting to kill it at any moment, and attacks the nearest evil creature using whatever attack form (melee or ranged attack, spell, supernatural or spell-like ability) is most effective against that foe, to the best of its knowledge. Affected creatures do not completely ignore other threats, but attack evil creatures in preference to any other foes. Abstinence Component: You must refrain from intoxicants and stimulants for one week before casting this spell.
Warcry							CLASSES:Champion of Gwynharwyf=2|Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=3										SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting				COMPS:V					CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.					TARGETAREA:Cone-shaped burst													DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates							SPELLRES:Yes				SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:You unleash a tremendous battle cry that causes creatures within a 30-foot cone to cower in fear for 1d4 rounds. Any creature that fails its Fortitude save loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and can take no actions. Foes gain a +2 bonus to hit cowering creatures.
Warding Gems						CLASSES:Cleric=5																	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Healing										COMPS:V, S, M				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:1 gem/3 caster levels												DURATION:1 hour/level					SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.111	DESC:You cast this spell upon one or more gems, imbuing them with healing energy. The gems leap from your hand, fly to the target, and begin orbiting the target's head like ioun stones. Each warding gem is a receptacle that holds 10 hp. The target can, as a free action, access the healing energy inside a warding gem; the energy is released as a purple-white arc of divine power that unerringly strikes the target, healing 10 points of damage. The target cannot choose to absorb only a portion of a warding gem's healing power. A warding gem depleted of its healing energy instantly turns to dust. At the end of the spell's duration, any unspent warding gems lose their healing power and fall to the ground; these can be reused for a later spell. A single creature can have no more than five warding gems encircling it at one time. A warding gem has AC 24, hardness 10, and 10 hp; if it's destroyed, any healing Material Components: One 500-gp gem for each warding gem created.
Winged Mount						CLASSES:Paladin=4																	SCHOOL:Transmutation													COMPS:V, S, DF				CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch						TARGETAREA:Special mount touched												DURATION:10 minutes/level				SAVEINFO:None									SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:This spell causes your mount to sprout giant, feathery white wings. The wings grant the mount a fly speed of 60 feet, with good maneuverability. The mount is slowed as normal for weight carried, barding worn, and environmental factors.
Yoke of Mercy						CLASSES:Apostle of Peace,Sorcerer,Wizard=2												SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Good|Mind-Affecting			COMPS:V, Abstinence			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close						TARGETAREA:One creature														DURATION:1 round/level					SAVEINFO:Will negates								SPELLRES:No					SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:This spell compels a creature up to 4 HD more than the caster's level to fight in a merciful manner. Specifically, the creature deals nonlethal damage with its attacks, avoids using damaging spells or spell-like abilities, and does not deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. Abstinence Component: You must not have dealt damage, by spell or any other means, to another living creature within the last 8 hours before casting this spell.
