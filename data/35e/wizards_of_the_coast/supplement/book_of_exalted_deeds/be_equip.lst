#Non Lethal Weapons
# Equipment Name	Required Weapon Proficiency		Type									Cost				Weight	Slot Needed	Crit Mult	Crit Range	Damage	Wield Category	Range		Size		Source Page		Special Property
Truncheon		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Truncheon		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Bludgeoning.NonLethal		COST:2			WT:12				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d8	WIELD:OneHanded			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	SPROP:A truncheon is essentially a heavier version of the sap-a one-handed martial weapon that deals nonlethal damage. As with a sap, a rogue wielding a truncheon can deal extra nonlethal damage with a sneak attack, but only if she is proficient in its use.

#Exotic
Entangling Pole	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Entangling Pole	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Reach.Piercing			COST:4			WT:5				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4	WIELD:TwoHanded			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	SPROP:The entangling pole is a highly specialized weapon, used to catch and entangle an opponent without causing great harm. It is normally used to hook and catch the clothing of an opponent. When you use an entangling pole in this way, you make a grapple attack without provoking an attack of opportunity. You make a melee touch attack with the weapon to "grab" the target's clothing. This attack does not work against a character in heavy armor, or against most monsters that do not wear clothing (though it does work against a monster with shaggy fur). If the touch attack is successful, you make an opposed grapple check, using the size modifier for the entangling pole (+4 for a two-handed weapon) instead of your own size. If you win the opposed check, you have a hold on the target, but you do not deal any damage. If you lose, you fail to start the grapple. To maintain the grapple, you do not need to move into your opponent's space. The entangling pole holds your opponent 10 feet away from you. While you maintain the grapple, you do not have the option to damage or pin your opponent. Your opponent can try to escape or wriggle free, attack with a light weapon, or cast a spell with no somatic components and a casting time of 1 standard action. An entangling pole can also be used as a normal weapon, dealing the damage shown on Table 3-1 but not entangling the opponent. An entangling pole has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
Grasping Pole	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Grasping Pole	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Reach.Bludgeoning.NonLethal	COST:8			WT:8				CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d4	WIELD:TwoHanded			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.33	SPROP:The grasping pole is a pole arm designed to capture opponents with a minimum of harm. A wielder who hits a Small or Medium opponent with a grasping pole can immediately initiate a grapple (as a free action) without provoking an attack of opportunity. (See Grapple in Chapter 8: Combat of the Player's Handbook for more information.) In addition to the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of a grasping pole can attempt to pull his target to the ground (the equivalent of a trip attack, though no attack roll is necessary). A grasping pole has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
#Ranged
Lasso			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Lasso		TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Exotic.Thrown				COST:2	COST:1	WT:3		SLOTS:2							WIELD:TwoHanded	RANGE:10			SOURCEPAGE:p.33	SPROP:A lasso is an entangling weapon that deals no damage, but it entangles only parts of an opponent's body. When you use a lasso to entangle your opponent's arms, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A lasso's maximum range is 30 feet. If you hit, the target is partially entangled, taking a -2 on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on effective Dexterity. The creature's speed is not reduced, and it can still charge or run, but if you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the lassoed creature can only move within the limits that the rope allows. If the lassoed creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a DC 15 Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell. The lassoed creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The lasso has 2 hp and can be broken with a DC 23 Strength check-also a full-round action. Alternatively, you can use a lasso to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the lasso to avoid being tripped.

Golden Ice																		TYPE:Ravage							COST:1200																SOURCEPAGE:p.35																				SPROP:Contact DC 14 1d6 Dex 2d6 Dex	SPROP:This crystalline substance is cold to the touch, though it doesn't melt except at infernally high temperatures. Evil creatures subjected to it feel its cold spreading throughout their bodies.
Celestial Lightsblood																TYPE:Ravage							COST:2500																SOURCEPAGE:p.35																				SPROP:Ingested DC 20 1d4 Dex 1d4 Con	SPROP:Celestial Lightsblood: This rare substance is as ethereal as pure alcohol, though it is not intoxicating. A pure silvery color, it first slows and then sickens creatures it affects.
Jade Water																		TYPE:Ravage							COST:350																SOURCEPAGE:p.35																				SPROP:Injury DC 14 1d4 Wis 1d4 Int, 1d4 Wis	SPROP:Jade Water: Jade is a potent substance, noted for its effects on certain kinds of evil supernatural creatures. Jade water is simply holy water with a suspension of jade crystals that takes on unusual potency as a ravage.
Purified Couatl Venom																TYPE:Ravage							COST:3000																SOURCEPAGE:p.36																				SPROP:Injury DC 16 2d4 Str 4d4 Str	SPROP:Purified Couatl Venom: The venom of a couatl, when milked from the creature and purified, becomes a potent ravage that severely weakens the victim.
Unicorn Blood																	TYPE:Ravage							COST:500																SOURCEPAGE:p.36																				SPROP:Injury DC 17 1d3 Str 1d4 Str	SPROP:Unicorn Blood: Drawn from a willing living unicorn, unicorn blood retains its potency as a ravage only as long as the unicorn that donated the blood remains alive.



### Specific EQUIPMENT:

Moonblood																		TYPE:Consumable.Material				COST:1500																SOURCEPAGE:p.																				SPROP:Celestials use this silvery substance as warpaint, painting their faces and other exposed areas of their bodies with elaborately entwined holy runes before entering battle. Proper application of moonblood warpaint takes 1 hour and requires a DC 22 Craft (painting) check; a failed check means no benefits are gained and the moonblood is wasted. When the moonblood runes are properly applied, the warpaint grants a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class. The warpaint lasts for 1 day, then is absorbed harmlessly into the skin. An evil creature that touches moonblood takes 1d6 points of damage. One application of moonblood costs 1,500 gp.																																																																																																			TEMPBONUS:ANYPC|COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Sacred

Devilhusk							PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Hide								TYPE:Armor.Medium.ArmorProfMedium.ArmorType_Medium.NonMetal				COST:33165				EQMOD:LEATHER.PLUS5A									SOURCEPAGE:p.112																				SPROP:+5 hide armor is fashioned from the skinned hide of a barbed devil. Barbs covering the armor allow the wearer to deal 3d8 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.
Vassal Armor						PROFICIENCY:ARMOR|Half-Plate							TYPE:Armor.Heavy.ArmorProfHeavy.ArmorType_Heavy						COST:38250																SOURCEPAGE:p.113																				SPROP:+3 exalted half-plate is reinforced with Ysgardian heartwire (see Special Materials in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment), which increases the wearer's AC by +2 solely for purposes of the roll to confirm a critical hit.


Longbow (Composite).COPY=Bow of the Solars
Sword (Bastard).COPY=Celestial Blade
Mace (Heavy).COPY=Celestial Mace
Dart.COPY=Dart of the Phoenix
Longsword.COPY=Nightblade of Arvandor

### Specific Weapons:
Bow of the Solars.MOD											TYPE:Weapon.Ranged					COST:100100										MODS:NO			SIZE:L	SOURCEPAGE:p.114																				SPROP:Large +2 composite longbow (+4 Str bonus) turns any arrow it fires into a slaying arrow targeting any creature type the wielder chooses.
Celestial Blade.MOD																	TYPE:Weapon.Melee						COST:18335										MODS:NO			SIZE:L	SOURCEPAGE:p.114																				SPROP:Large +3 bastard sword is the favored weapon of planetars. It always shines light equivalent to a torch (20-foot radius, with shadowy illumination out to a range of 40 feet), and its blade is typically engraved with the symbol of the deity served by the planetar
Celestial Mace.MOD																TYPE:Weapon.Melee						COST:50312										MODS:NO			SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.114																				SPROP:+3 disruption heavy mace is the favored weapon of astral devas. It always shines light equivalent to a torch (20-foot radius, with shadowy illumination out to a range of 40 feet).
Dart of the Phoenix.MOD																TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Thrown				COST:99400.5									MODS:NO					SOURCEPAGE:p.114																				SPROP:+1 returning dart has a tail made of phoenix feathers. Throwing the dart requires a sacrifice of 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage. However, any creature struck by the dart, regardless of whether it takes damage, must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly slain and reduced to a small pile of ashes. If the save succeeds,  the creature takes 13d6 points of fire damage instead. If a creature makes its saving throw but is slain by the damage, it is reduced to a pile of ashes as well. Any creature reduced to ashes by the dart reforms after 2d6 rounds, appearing in the exact spot where it died and in whatever state it was before being incinerated. Although damage from the actual dart remains, all fire damage is instantly restored. Creatures immune to fire take no fire damage and are not incinerated. Fire resistance applies to damage dealt if a creature makes its Fortitude save.

Demondoom																		TYPE:Weapon.Melee						COST:51512										MODS:NO					SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:Favored by dwarven foes of the tanar'ri, this +2 holy demon bane warhammer is fashioned from cold iron with a head shaped like two clenched fists. Once per day, the wielder can make a blinding strike against a demon. The wielder must declare he is using the blinding strike before making the attack roll; if the attack hits and the hammer bypasses the demon's spell resistance with a successful level check (1d20+15), the demon is blinded as if by a power word blind spell. If the attack misses or the blinding strike is used on a creature other than a demon, the blinding strike is wasted.
#+2 holy demon bane warhammer
Hellpiercer																		TYPE:Ammo.Bolt.Arrow					COST:4007										MODS:NO					SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:Tested in battle against the fiendish legions of Hell, this colorful +3 shocking burst arrow or +3 shocking burst bolt is treated as a silvered weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Furthermore, the head of the arrow or bolt contains a tiny reservoir of purified couatl venom (see Ravages and Afflictions in Chapter 3: Exalted Equipment). This ravage harms only evil creatures, including outsiders that are normally immune to poison (such as devils).
Nightblade of Arvandor																TYPE:Weapon.Melee						COST:44315										MODS:NO					SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:This +2 longsword appears to be made of black steel. Within the blade, one can see miniscule twinkling stars. Upon command, the sword launches starlike pulses of light. Each round, as a standard action, the nightblade can fire as many stars from its blade as the wielder has ranged attacks. Using the sword in this fashion provokes attacks of opportunity, and each star requires its own ranged touch attack roll. A nonevil creature struck by a star takes 1d8 points of damage, half of which is nonlethal damage (rounded down). An evil creature struck by a star takes 1d8 points of lethal damage. The stars are magical force, not weapons, so they ignore damage reduction and incorporeality.

### RINGS:
Ring of Adamantine Touch															TYPE:Ring.Magic						COST:120000																SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:When worn, this adamantine ring allows the wearer to make melee weapon attacks and natural attacks as though wielding an adamantine weapon.
Ring of Affliction																TYPE:Ring.Magic						COST:72000																SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:This mithral ring is shaped like a beautiful feathered serpent. Any natural or unarmed attack made by the ring's wearer forces the target to succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or succumb to an affliction of the ring wearer's choice (see the affliction spell description for more information).
Ring of Solar Wings																TYPE:Ring.Magic						COST:118000																SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:This brilliant gold ring causes is inlaid with celestial script. When the ring is put on, the wearer grows gleaming white wings (like those of a solar) and gains the ability fly at a speed of 150 feet (good maneuverability). The wings disappear if the ring is removed. If the ring is removed while the wearer is in flight, the wearer floats to the ground as per a feather fall spell. If the wearer already has a functional set of wings, the ring does not create new ones, but the wearer may use the ring's fly speed if it's faster.
Ring of Vengeance																	TYPE:Ring.Magic						COST:4500																SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:This gold ring glows softly when worn by a good-aligned creature. If the wearer of the ring dies, an arc of divine energy leaps from the ring and deals 15d6 points of damage to the creature that dealt the killing blow. The damage is of divine origin and of a nonspecific energy type. The target of the attack can make a DC 19 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. Once the ring unleashes its energy, it turns to dust.

### STAFFS:
Staff of Rapture																	TYPE:Staff.Magic						COST:73800																SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:[Caster Level 12] This ash staff bears a few holy etchings but otherwise looks unremarkable. However, in the hands of a cleric, the staff sheds golden light as brightly as a torch. The staff of rapture can be used as a +1 quarterstaff, but it deals only nonlethal damage. Against evil creatures, it has a critical threat range of 17-20. The staff allows use of the following spells: . Atonement (2 charges) . Divination (1 charges) . Elation (1 charge) . Sword of conscience (2 charges) . Vision of heaven (1 charge)
Sunstaff																		TYPE:Staff.Magic						COST:173300																SOURCEPAGE:p.115																				SPROP:[Caster Level 16] This staff is fashioned from bleached darkwood and capped with an ornate golden sunburst set with a cut diamond. As a free action, the sunstaff can be turned into a +3 brilliant energy quarterstaff. Turning the quarterstaff back into staff form is also a free action and allows use of the following spells: . Bless (1 charge) . Crown of flame (2 charges) . Searing light (1 charge) . Shield other (1 charge)

### WONDROUS ITEMS:
Antimagic Shackles																TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Shackles.Restraints	COST:132000																SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:These adamantine manacles fit any Small to Large creature and create an antimagic field to a radius of 5 feet when they are fastened. The DC to slip out of the shackles is 28, but breaking them is nearly impossible, requiring a DC 40 Strength check.
Incense of Consecration																TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Consumable			COST:300																SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:When burned in a censer or thurible, the smoke from this incense creates a consecrate effect in a 20-foot emanation. For the duration of the effect, the censer or thurible can be moved, moving the area of the consecrate as well. The incense burns for 6 hours, after which it loses all magical properties.
Retributive Amulet																TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Amulet			COST:56000																SOURCEPAGE:p.116															BONUS:COMBAT|AC|2|TYPE=Sacred	SPROP:This amulet provides a +2 sacred bonus to AC. In addition, when the wearer takes damage from a melee attack made with a natural or hand-held weapon, the damage is divided equally between the attacker and the target. If the damage is an odd number, the extra point of damage goes to the attacker. The retributive amulet deals the same types of wounds upon the attacker that the wearer receives, but only damage to hit points. For example, a rogue who uses a poisoned dagger to stab the amulet's wearer would receive an identical gash in the same spot as the wearer, but would not suffer ability loss from the weapon's poison. The amulet must be worn to function; it needs no command word for activation.
Shackles of Silence																TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Shackles.Restraints	COST:12000																SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:These wrought-iron manacles fit any Small to Large creature. They exude a silence effect in a radius just large enough to contain the creature they hold-a 2 1/2- foot radius for a Small or Medium creature, a 5-foot radius for a Large creature. However, if the creature bound by them escapes without opening them-by slipping out of the shackles or breaking them-the silence effect ends and the shackles ring for 1 round, as the effect of an alarmspell's audible alarm. The DC to break or slip out of the shackles is 28.
Starmantle Cloak																	TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Cape.Cloak			COST:132000																SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:This draping black cloak turns into a sparkling mantle of tiny, cascading stars when worn. The cloak sheds light as a torch, renders the wearer impervious to nonmagical weapon attacks, and transforms any nonmagical weapon or missile that strikes the wearer into harmless light, destroying it. Contact with the starmantle does not destroy magic weapons or missiles, but the starmantle's wearer is entitled to a DC 15 Reflex save each time he is struck by such a weapon; success indicates that the wearer takes only half damage from the attack.
Thurible of Consecration															TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic				COST:5000																SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:Each of these golden censers is sacred to a particular deity whose symbol appears on it. When a cleric of that deity burns incense of consecration in the thurible and carries it, the effects of the incense are increased as though an altar or similar fixture were in the area of the consecrate spell, doubling its effects. If a cleric of a different deity uses the thurible, it has no special effect.
Trumpet of Doom																	TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Instrument			COST:7185																SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:This small brass trumpet is engraved with interwoven patterns of feathers and flames. The trumpet emits a haunting blare that fills evil enemies with a terrible sense of dread. All evil creatures within 100 feet that can hear the trumpet's blare are shaken for 1 minute (DC 14 Will save negates). The trumpet can be blown up to three times per day.
Trumpet of Healing																TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Instrument			COST:115440																SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:This finely wrought trumpet plays beautifully in the hands of any talented trumpeter. Invoking any of its magic, however, requires playing the horn uninterrupted for a full round and making a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check. The trumpeteer can employ the trumpet three times per day, selecting from the following powers for each use: remove blindness/deafness, remove disease, cure serious wounds, or neutralize poison. These powers affect all creatures within 360 feet of the horn. In addition, the trumpet can heal a single creature within hearing range of the uplifting song once per day. Evil creatures cannot benefit from these effects; in fact, they hear nothing at all when the horn plays. The trumpeter cannot personally benefit from the trumpet's healing powers.
Vambraces of Evil's Warding															TYPE:Wondrous Item.Magic.Bracer			COST:18000		SLOTS:2													SOURCEPAGE:p.116																				SPROP:These golden bracers are engraved with holy runes and fit snugly over the arms of any creature that dons them. Ranged attacks made by evil creatures against the wearer take a -4 penalty. An evil creature that dons the vambraces of evil's warding takes 2d6 points of damage per round.

### Major Artifacts:
Cup of Al'Akbar																	TYPE:Artifact																							SOURCEPAGE:p.118																				SPROP:This chalice is made of hammered gold, chased with silver filigree and set with twelve great gems (apparent value 75,000 gp). It does not radiate magic, although it glows with a warm golden light. Seven times per day, the cup can turn ordinary water into a potion of cure light wounds (1d8+1). The potion must be imbibed directly from the cup; it reverts to ordinary water if poured into another vessel. The holder of the cup can also use a bless spell once per day (cast at 20th level). A nongood keeper of the cup takes 1 point of permanent Constitution drain each day the cup remains in his custody. This drain cannot be restored by any means except a wish or miracle spell. If the keeper's Constitution drops to 0, he dies and turns into a deathless guardian (see the deathless creature type in Chapter 8: Monsters) bound to the cup. This ability score drain is cumulative with the drain from the Talisman of Al'Akbar (see below).
Talisman of Al'Akbar																TYPE:Artifact																							SOURCEPAGE:p.118																				SPROP:The talisman is made of hammered platinum in the shape of an eight-pointed star, chased with gold inlays, and with a small gem tipping each point. The star depends from a chain of gold set with silver beading (apparent value 25,000 gp). Like the cup, the talisman does not radiate magic. However, the wearer can use the following spells: At will-remove disease; 1/day-remove curse. A nongood keeper of the talisman takes 1 point of permanent Constitution drain each day the cup remains in his custody. This drain cannot be restored by any means except a wish or miracle spell. If the keeper's Constitution drops to 0, he dies and turns into a deathless guardian (see the deathless creature type in Chapter 8: Monsters) bound to the cup. This ability score drain is cumulative with the drain from the Cup of Al'Akbar (see above).	SPROP:A creature wearing the talisman and holding the cup can cast resurrection three times per week. Casting the spell requires a 10-minute ritual during which a vial of holy water must be poured into the cup and poured over the remains of the creature to be resurrected. The spell works only on nonevil creatures and ignores the usual material component cost.|PREEQUIP:1,Cup of Al'Akbar
The Regalia of Good (Crown)															TYPE:Artifact.RegaliaOfGood																					SOURCEPAGE:p.119	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|The Regalia of Good|PREEQUIP:2,TYPE=RegaliaOfGood						SPROP:This thin coronet of twisted mithral is elegant and slender, fashioned to look like rays of light surrounding the head of the wearer. When a good creature puts on the crown, its head is indeed surrounded in a brilliant halo of light. The wearer gains immunity to electricity, a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class, and spell resistance 20. He can use the spell guidance at will. He can use the following spells three times per day each: heroes' feast, sending, and greater status. Once per day, he can surround himself with a globe of invulnerability. All spells are cast at 20th level. The wearer cannot speak any lies while wearing the crown.
The Regalia of Good (Scepter)															TYPE:Artifact.RegaliaOfGood																					SOURCEPAGE:p.119	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|The Regalia of Good|PREEQUIP:2,TYPE=RegaliaOfGood						SPROP:This slender rod is made of mithral, wreathed in a pattern of intertwining leaves. One end constantly glows with a soft white light equivalent to a torch, but heatless. While in a good character's possession, it confers a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma and grants immunity to mind-affecting spells and effects. The wielder can command obedience as if it were a rod of rulership with no use limit, and can use holy smite (DC 19) and searing light (DC 18) three times per day each. All spells are cast at 20th level. The wielder of the scepter becomes increasingly unable to refuse pleas for help, no matter how desperate the cause.
The Regalia of Good (Orb)															TYPE:Artifact.RegaliaOfGood																					SOURCEPAGE:p.119	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|The Regalia of Good|PREEQUIP:2,TYPE=RegaliaOfGood						SPROP:This 6-inch sphere is made of purest crystal, encased in a filigree cage of polished mithral laurel leaves. A good wielder can turn or destroy undead as a 15th-level cleric. While in a good character's possession, it confers a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. Further, the orb can be used to scry like a crystal ball with the added ability to detect thoughts. Once per day, the orb can be used to cast heal (as a 20th-level cleric) by touch.




###MISC:
#Redeemed Demon Armor			SOURCEPAGE:p.119	TYPE:RedeemedItem.Magic	SPROP:When it is redeemed, the very shape of demon armor shifts so that its visage, while still bestial, appears more like a snarling hound or warden archon, or perhaps a guardinal. It remains +4 full plate, and still allows the wearer to make claw attacks. These attacks deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and affect the target as if she had been struck by a sword of conscience spell (Will negates DC 16). The armor bestows one negative level on any nongood creature wearing it, rather than affecting nonevil creatures.
