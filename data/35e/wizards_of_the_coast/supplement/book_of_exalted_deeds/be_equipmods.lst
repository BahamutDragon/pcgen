###Block: Special Materials
# Modifier Name		Unique Key				Type					Plus		Cost		Visible		Source Page		Required Type				Modify VAR				Special Property
Aurorum			KEY:BE_AURORUM			TYPE:Weapon.Shield.Armor			COST:4000	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.38												SPROP:An aurorum weapon, shield, or suit of armor that has been sundered can be reformed by bringing together its fragments (a full-round action). The broken pieces bond quickly and seamlessly, restoring the item to its previous state.
Frystalline			KEY:BE_FRYSTALLINE		TYPE:Weapon						COST:2000	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.38												SPROP:Any weapon made of frystalline is treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction
Serren			KEY:BE_SERREN			TYPE:Weapon						COST:4000	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	PRETYPE:1,Bow,Arrow,Bolt							SPROP:Serren trees grow on Arvandor, the uppermost of Arborea's three layers. The trees serve as vessels for nature spirits, and any branch that falls from a serren tree can be fashioned into a bow, arrow, or crossbow bolt imbued with a portion of the tree's spirit. Serren bows, arrows, and bolts have the ghost touch special quality, although this property is not magical. The market price modifier for a serren weapon (one bow or 50 arrows or bolts) is +4,000 gp.

Solarian Truesteel	KEY:BE_SOLARIAN_TRUESTEEL																											SPROP:Mined on the fourth layer of the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia, this fine iron needs no alloy and shines with a silvery gleam. When forged into a weapon, it gives the wielder a +1 bonus on the confirmation roll for a critical hit. The market price modifier for such a weapon is +1,000 gp. Solarian truesteel has 25 hp per inch of thickness and hardness 11.
Storm Tears			KEY:BE_STORM_TEARS																												SPROP:This milky rain falls on the Upper Planes and usually heralds the death of a powerful champion of good or the birth of a stillborn child. These milky tears can be collected. A single vial of storm tears duplicates the effects of a heart's ease spell (see Chapter 6: Magic for details). Storm tears are nonmagical in nature, and each vial has a market price of 750 gp.
Ysgardian Heartwire	KEY:BE_YSGARDIAN_HEARTWIRE																											SPROP:This incredibly fine, flexible metal is found only in the deep mines of Nidavellir in the Heroic Domains of Ysgard. It is not suitable for making an entire suit of armor, but small sections of heartwire mail can be incorporated into chain shirts, chainmail, or heavy armor to reinforce vital areas. This reinforcement has the effect of increasing the wearer's AC by +2 solely for purposes of the roll to confirm a critical hit. The heartwire is so fine and light that it does not increase the armor's weight. The market price modifier for such a suit of armor is +1,500 gp.

Sanctified			KEY:BE_SANCTIFIED			TYPE:Weapon								VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.33												SPROP:Sanctified weapons are not inherently magical, though they are inherently good and radiate a faint aura of good.

In addition, creatures with the corrupted template (described in the Book of Vile Darkness) cannot recover hit point damage dealt by a sanctified weapon by means of normal healing, including fast healing.
