Blistering Flourish											CLASSES:Swordsage=1				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.				TARGETAREA:30-ft.-radius burst centered on you				DURATION:1 minute						SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates												SOURCEPAGE:p.52	DESC:Your weapon bursts into flames as you twirl it over your head. With a flourish, you cause the fire to explode with a blinding flash. When you use this strike, you generate a burst of brilliant light. Any creature other than you caught in this maneuver's area must make a Fortitude save (DC 11 + your Wis modifier) or be dazzled for 1 minute. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Burning Blade												CLASSES:Swordsage=1				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Boost			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:End of turn																					SOURCEPAGE:p.52	DESC:Your blade bursts into flame as it sweeps toward your foe in an elegant arc. A subtle yet precise twisting of your blade unlocks the power of flame. When you initiate this maneuver, fire trails from your melee weapon. For the rest of your turn, your melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per initiator level. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Burning Brand												CLASSES:Swordsage=2				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Boost			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:End of turn																					SOURCEPAGE:p.52	DESC:Your weapon transforms into a roaring gout of flame. As you swing your burning blade, it stretches out beyond your normal reach to scorch your foes. When you initiate this maneuver, your weapon turns into a burning brand for the rest of your turn. The brand increases your reach by 5 feet, and your melee attacks made with the brand deal fire damage equal to your normal melee damage. You still gain all the normal benefits from a high Strength score, feats, and other effects that increase your melee damage. For example, an attack with a longsword that normally deals 1d8+4 points of slashing damage would instead deal 1d8+4 points of fire damage. You otherwise attack with your weapon as normal. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Death Mark													CLASSES:Swordsage=3				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Strike			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One creature	TARGETAREA:Variable spread; see text	DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Reflex half; see text											SOURCEPAGE:p.52	DESC:As your weapon strikes your foe, his body convulses as waves of flame run down your blade into his body. The fire causes him to briefly glow with a brilliant internal fire before the flames erupt from his body in a terrible explosion. When you use the strike, you channel overwhelming fiery energy into the body of your foe. In addition to dealing normal melee damage with your attack, you cause fire to erupt from your enemy's body in a spread. The radius of the spread is determined by the size of the target creature, as indicated on the table below. All creatures in the area, including your enemy, take 6d6 points of fire damage, with a Reflex save (DC 13 + your Wis modifier) for half. This radius is centered on the creature's position. You have immunity to the fire damage from your own death mark. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Desert Tempest												CLASSES:Swordsage=6				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 full-round action	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																											PRESPELLSCHOOL:2,Desert Wind=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.52	DESC:You move in a blur, leaving scorch marks in your wake as you twirl around the battlefield, slicing into your foes as you move. As part of this maneuver, you move up to your speed. Each time you exit a square adjacent to an enemy, you can first make a single melee attack against that foe.

Distracting Ember												CLASSES:Swordsage=1				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Boost								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:30 ft.				TARGETAREA: One summoned fire elemental					DURATION:End of turn																					SOURCEPAGE:p.52	DESC:A wave of heat sweeps over the area, forms a small dust funnel, and ignites into flame next to your foe. This boost allows you to conjure a Small fire elemental (MM 99) to threaten your enemy, providing you or an ally with the benefit of a flanking position. You can use this ability to place the elemental in any space within range. The elemental remains until the end of your current turn. It threatens all creatures within its reach. It takes no actions or attacks of opportunity during your turn. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Dragon's Flame												CLASSES:Swordsage=5				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Strike			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.				TARGETAREA:Cone									DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Reflex half							PRESPELLSCHOOL:2,Desert Wind=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	DESC:With a defiant roar, you summon your ki and unleash it, igniting it with a combination of your meditative focus and seething fury. As a master of the Desert Wind advances in his studies, he learns to stoke raging fires with his ki. This maneuver allows you to generate a gout of fire similar to a dragon's burning breath. With this maneuver, you blast forth a cone of fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to everything in the area. Creatures in the area can attempt Reflex saves (DC 15 + your Wis modifier) for half damage. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Fan The Flames												CLASSES:Swordsage=3				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Strike			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.				TARGETAREA:One creature																										PRESPELLSCHOOL:1,Desert Wind=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	DESC:Flickering flame dances across your blade, then springs toward your target as you sweep your sword through the air.

TARGETAREA:Special								DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Reflex half							PRESPELLSCHOOL:2,Desert Wind=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	DESC:You drive your weapon into the ground, causing a gout of fire to jet into the air. The fire flows back to the ground and creeps ahead like a serpent, sweeping over your enemies and roasting them where they stand. When you initiate this maneuver, you cause a line of fire to twist across an area to burn your enemies. This line is 60 feet long. Unlike a standard line, a firesnake can bend and twist to hit your foes. A firesnake starts in an adjacent square. It can move up to 60 feet each round. It can move out of your line of sight or line of effect, but you gain no special knowledge of the areas it moves into. If a firesnake moves into a creature's space, that creature takes 6d6 points of fire damage, with a Reflex save (DC 14 + your Wis modifier) for half damage. A creature can only take damage from the firesnake once in a single round. It makes the saving throw and takes damage the first time that the firesnake touches it. After that, a firesnake has no effect on that creature. A firesnake must move along the ground. It cannot fly, and it pays the standard movement penalties for difficult terrain and other effects. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.

Flashing sun allows you to make an additional melee attack during this round. As part of this maneuver, you take a full attack action and make your normal melee attacks. However, you can make one additional attack this round at your highest attack bonus. All the attacks you make this round, including the extra attack granted by this maneuver, are made with a -2 penalty.
Hatchling's Flame												CLASSES:Swordsage=2				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Strike			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.				TARGETAREA:Cone									DURATION:Instantaneous					SAVEINFO:Reflex half							PRESPELLSCHOOL:1,Desert Wind=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:You focus a burning aura of energy at the end of your blade. It forms a seething sphere that, after a moment, bursts into a torrent of energy. The Desert Wind discipline teaches its students how to unleash their ki as burning energy.

This stance is a supernatural ability.
Inferno Blade												CLASSES:Swordsage=7				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Boost			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:End of turn																					SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:A blinding light flashes from your weapon, and for a split second, it transforms into burning magma.

You instantly appear in a square adjacent to a creature that attacks you with a melee or ranged attack, after resolving the enemy's attack. You cannot move into a space that is occupied by a creature or object. You can move up to 100 feet in this manner. If you cannot move adjacent to the target, this maneuver fails to function but is still considered used. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Lingering Inferno												CLASSES:Swordsage=5				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Strike			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One creature								DURATION:3 rounds; see text														PRESPELLSCHOOL:2,Desert Wind=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:A blue, dancing flame appears on your weapon.

As part of this maneuver, you can move up to two times your speed along the ground. All of your movement must be along continuous, solid ground. You leave a trail of flames in your wake. These flames have no effect unless they form a closed area. In this case, a raging inferno erupts within that area. All creatures within the area take 12d6 points of fire damage, with a Reflex save (DC 16 + your Wis modifier) for half damage. The inferno erupts the first time you form a closed area. You cannot create multiple areas in one move. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.
Rising Phoenix												CLASSES:Swordsage=8				SCHOOL:Desert Wind	SUBSCHOOL:Stance			DESCRIPTOR:Fire			CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:Stance																PRESPELLSCHOOL:3,Desert Wind=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:Hot wind swirls about your feet, lifting you skyward as flames begin to flicker below. A column of superheated air lifts you into the air. While you are in this stance, you can hover up to 10 feet above any solid or liquid surface. You gain a fly speed equal to your land speed, with perfect maneuverability, but you must remain within 10 feet of the ground when you fly. If you hover in place and make a full attack, the column of air becomes superheated, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage to creatures adjacent to or within the column, including creatures adjacent to your square. You are not harmed by this effect. You can move across shallow pits or other such variations in terrain without losing altitude, so long as your movement wouldn't take you more than 10 feet above a solid or liquid surface. If you are ever more than 10 feet above the ground (such as if the floor drops out from under you or you move over the edge of a tall cliff), the rising phoenix stance immediately ends and you fall to the ground.

You initiate this maneuver as part of a charge attack. As with a charge, you can move up to double your speed and make a single attack, gaining a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a -2 penalty to your Armor Class while you move and until your next turn. Unlike a normal charge, however, your salamander charge does not need to be in a straight line and is not impeded by difficult terrain, or even other creatures. You can change direction as much as you want during your movement, and you can also use your Tumble skill to avoid attacks of opportunity or to move through opponents' squares during the charge. When you initiate a salamander charge, a wall of shimmering, spectral fire appears in each of the squares along the path you take. A creature standing in the wall takes 6d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of that creature's turn. A creature occupying a square adjacent to the wall takes 3d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. Creatures that move into or through the wall also take 6d6 points of fire damage.

While you are in this stance, your attacks have the potential to be utterly devastating. When rolling damage for a melee attack, you gain a special benefit from any damage die that rolls its maximum amount (such as a result of 6 on a d6). When one or more of your damage dice show a maximum possible result, reroll each such die and add its result to the original damage total.

You can use this ability once per round. Using this ability does not take an action. You simply decide to invoke it before rolling a d20 for any reason, such as for an attack, save, or check.

While you are in this stance, you drain hit points from your allies. At the end of your turn, you can choose to deal 2 points of damage to each willing ally within 10 feet.

As you strike your foe, that energy detonates in a burst that scythes through those who stand against your cause. When you use this strike, make a single melee attack. If you hit your opponent and his alignment has at least one component different from yours, a blast of divine energy originates from your attack's point of impact. The target of this strike takes an extra 8d6 points of damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 17 + your Cha modifier) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 minute. All of your opponents within a 30- foot-radius burst of the target creature must also succeed on a Fortitude save. Those who fail take 5d6 points of damage and take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 minute. A successful save results in half damage and negates the  attack penalty.
Crusader's Strike												CLASSES:Crusader=1				SCHOOL:Devoted Spirit	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One creature																																SOURCEPAGE:p.58	DESC:Divine energy surrounds your weapon as you strike.

When your blows strike home, you send your foe tumbling back on the defensive. He must deal with you first, or leave himself open to your deadly counter. Defensive rebuke allows you to excel at controlling the battlefield around you. Your enemies must pay heed to the threat you pose. If they ignore you in favor of attacking other targets, you take advantage of their lapses with a punishing counterattack. Each enemy you strike after you initiate this maneuver becomes vulnerable to your further attacks. If such an opponent attacks anyone other than you in melee for the duration of the maneuver, that attack provokes an attack of opportunity from you (each separate attack a target makes provokes an attack of opportunity, making this boost especially lethal if you have Combat Reflexes). Enemies you strike become aware of the consequences of the maneuver.

Foehammer													CLASSES:Crusader=2				SCHOOL:Devoted Spirit	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One creature																																SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:Your throw yourself behind your attack, lending your blow such great weight and force that you leave injuries that even magical defenses cannot mend. Your devotion to your cause gives you boundless energy that allows you to smash through supernatural defenses. When you land an attack, you hit with such force that damage reduction offers little resistance against you. When you use this maneuver, you make a melee attack against a single foe. This attack automatically overcomes the opponent's damage reduction and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.
Immortal Fortitude											CLASSES:Crusader=8				SCHOOL:Devoted Spirit	SUBSCHOOL:Stance								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:Stance																PRESPELLSCHOOL:3,Devoted Spirit=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	DESC:Despite the horrific wounds you suffer, the flash of searing spells, and the crash of a foe's mighty attacks, you stand resolute on the field. So long as the potential for victory exists, you fight on. Death has little meaning to you in light of the cause you fight for. So long as the mission stands before you uncompleted, or a battle remains in doubt, you fight on. Stories abound of crusaders who, while in the grips of this stance, fought for days on end to hold a mountain pass against orcs, trolls, and other fiends. So long as you remain in this stance, you cannot be killed or incapacitated by effects or attacks that reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points. If you take such damage, you can make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to your negative hit point total. If you fail this save, you die or fall unconscious (as appropriate). If this save is successful, you are still alive and conscious, with 1 hit point remaining. This stance provides no protection against effects that slay you without dealing hit point damage, or other effects that petrify, paralyze, and so forth. You can still be slain by a coup de grace if a spell or effect renders you helpless. After you attempt three saving throws to avoid death or unconsciousness, this stance automatically ends. You can activate it again on your turn as normal. Even the toughest crusader can endure only so much punishment.

Even the slightest move provokes a stinging counter from you. While you are in this stance, any opponent you threaten that takes any sort of movement, including a 5-foot step, provokes an attack of opportunity from you. Your foes provoke this attack before leaving the area you threaten. Your opponents also cannot use the withdraw action (PH 143) to treat the square they start in as no longer threatened by you.

When a spell or other attack strikes you, you move a split second before you are even aware of the threat. Your mind is a keenly honed weapon. Other warriors rely on their physical talents. You know that a mix of mental acuity and martial training, along with a strong sword arm, is an unbeatable combination. This maneuver epitomizes your approach. Your mind, rather than your raw reflexes, dictates your defenses. You can use this maneuver any time you would be required to make a Reflex save. Roll a Concentration check instead of the Reflex save and use the result of that check to determine the save's success. You must use this maneuver before you roll the Reflex save. A result of a natural 1 on your Concentration check is not an automatic failure.

You lash at an opponent. If your attack hits, you repeat the same attack again and again at nearly superhuman speed, allowing you to score multiple hits in a blur of activity. Unfortunately, as soon as an attack misses, your tempo breaks, and this delicate maneuver crumbles into a flurry of wasted motion. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent. If that attack hits, resolve your damage as normal. You can then make another attack against that foe with a -4 penalty on your attack roll. If that attack hits, you can make another attack against that opponent with a -8 penalty. You continue to make additional attacks, each one with an additional -4 penalty, until you miss or your opponent is reduced to -1 hit points or fewer.

The DC of this check is the target creature's AC. You then make a single melee attack against your target, also as part of the maneuver. If your Concentration check succeeds, this attack deals four times your normal melee damage. If your check fails, your attack is made with a -2 penalty and doesn't deal any additional damage. If your strike is a critical hit, you stack the multipliers as normal (PH 304).

You mentally probe his defenses in search of a weakness. A lesser warrior could spent long minutes pondering this problem, but you see an opening and seize upon it in an instant.

When you focus your mind, even the most elusive opponent becomes an easy target. As part of this maneuver, make a single melee attack against an opponent. This is a touch attack rather than a standard melee attack. If you hit, you deal normal melee damage.

Make a Concentration check instead of the Fortitude save and use the result of that check to determine the save's success. You must use this maneuver before you attempt the Fortitude save.

Your training, mental acuity, and drive allow you to move with greater speed and confidence than other warriors. This maneuver requires a swift action to initiate. You can take a free move action after you initiate this maneuver. You can use any of the options available for a move action. You can then use the rest of your actions as normal. For example, you could use this maneuver to move next to a foe, then take a full attack action. You could move, then make a charge attack, and so forth. The move action you gain from this maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
Rapid Counter												CLASSES:Swordsage,Warblade=5			SCHOOL:Diamond Mind	SUBSCHOOL:Counter								CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.65	DESC:You lash out, your weapon a blur, hammering at the slightest gap that appears in your foe's defenses.

You can also use this maneuver before making your normal attack of opportunity when an opponent provokes (or vice versa). The attack granted by the maneuver is not an extra attack of opportunity. You can initiate this maneuver before, after, in addition to, or instead of making an attack of opportunity against an opponent (thus possibly saving your attack of opportunity to use against another enemy later in the round).

You move slightly faster than normal due to a combination of confidence, training, and clarity of mind. This slight edge adds up with each action. Your mental swiftness translates to physical action on the battlefield. You are constantly on edge, allowing you to react to multiple attacks and threats. Most warriors can only manage a single counter move each round. While you are in this stance, you can use one counter per round without taking an immediate action. You cannot use the same maneuver two times in a round. In essence, one counter you use during the round does not require an immediate action. If you have already taken an immediate action within the past round, such as casting a feather fall spell, you can still use this stance to initiate a counter.

Your other opponents fade from sight as your mind locks onto your target. This stance allows you to focus on a single opponent to the exclusion of all others. You read your foe's fighting stance, his favored attacks, and the methods he used to train. By combining these factors into a single analysis of his abilities, you see how to foil his attacks. While you are in this stance, you must choose a single opponent as your target at the start of your turn. You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC against that foe until you change the target of this stance. You take a -2 penalty to AC against all other opponents while using stance of clarity.

In an unmatched burst of speed, agility, and decisive action, you move more quickly than the eye can follow. You can lash out with your blade, striking your opponent so rapidly that observers can't keep track of your moves. As part of this maneuver, you can use a full attack action two times in succession. Take your first full attack as normal. Once you have resolved those attacks, you can then take another full attack action. You must resolve these actions separately. You cannot combine the attacks provided by both actions as you wish. Instead, you must take them separately and in order as normal for a full attack.

As you turn, your weapon flashes through the enemies around you like a blazing comet. As you drop back to the ground in your fighting stance, your enemies crumple to the ground around you. You sweep your weapon in a circle around you, striking out at nearby enemies. You strike with the speed and ferocity of a lightning bolt, forcing your enemies to rely on their reflexes for protection rather than their armor and shields. You make two melee attacks against each adjacent opponent you threaten when you initiate this maneuver. You receive a +4 bonus on each of these attacks, which are otherwise made with your highest attack bonus.
Dancing Blade Form											CLASSES:Warblade=5				SCHOOL:Iron Heart		SUBSCHOOL:Stance								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:Stance																PRESPELLSCHOOL:2,Iron Heart=1		SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:You strike forward like a slithering snake, extending yourself almost beyond your ability to maintain your balance. Your foe stumbles backward, surprised that you could reach him from such a great distance. By carefully distributing your weight and establishing a steady, rugged posture, you can reach out and strike opponents with your melee attacks at a greater than normal distance. A warrior with less training and expertise would fall flat on his face attempting this maneuver. You, on the other hand, have the grace, focus, and skill needed to complete this complex move. While you are in this stance, you gain a bonus to your reach during your turn. When you make a melee attack, your reach increases by 5 feet. Your reach is not improved when it is not your turn, such as when you make an attack of opportunity.

Your mastery of the Iron Heart style has taught you much about the power within a blade, and you can use this knowledge to not only enhance your own ability but also to deprive others of that power. When you initiate this maneuver, you attack your opponent's weapon (PH 158). This attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you succeed, your foe takes a -4 penalty on melee damage rolls for 1 minute. The wielder of the weapon can attempt a Will save (DC 13 + your Str modifier) to halve this penalty.

It leaves in its wake a trail of battered enemies. The Iron Heart tradition's more esoteric teachings allow a student to transform any melee weapon into a thrown projectile. By focusing your concentration and attuning your senses to your weapon's balance, you can throw almost anything. When you use this strike, you make a single melee attack (even though you are throwing your weapon). You deal damage to each creature in the maneuver's area equal to your normal melee damage (including damage from your Strength modifier, feats, magical abilities on your weapon, and so forth), plus an extra 12d6 points of damage. Each creature in the attack's area can make a Reflex save with a DC equal to the result of your attack roll. A successful save halves the damage dealt.

Your foe can barely control its momentum as its attack now slams into an ally. When you initiate this maneuver, you can attempt to block an enemy's melee attack that targets you and redirect it to another target adjacent to you. Make a melee attack roll. If your result is greater than your foe's attack roll, you bat aside the strike and direct it against a target of your choice that stands adjacent to you. You must decide whether to initiate this maneuver after the enemy attacks, but before you know whether or not the attack you are attempting to deflect actually hits. If the attack misses, you can still attempt to deflect it. If you succeed in deflecting the attack, use the result of your opponent's attack roll to determine if it strikes the new target. This maneuver functions only against armed melee attacks. You cannot use it against unarmed attacks, natural weapons, or touch spells.

These attacks come at a cost, as your enemies slash at your undefended legs and flanks. You hold your weapon overhead, allowing you to chop down with superior force. However, this fighting stance leaves you vulnerable to an opponent's attacks. Only an initiate of the Iron Heart tradition can manage the perilous balance between trading attack power for defense. A lesser warrior would leave himself nearly helpless to resist an opponent's attacks. While you are in this stance, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with all melee attacks. You also take a -2 penalty to AC, because this fighting stance emphasizes power over a defensive posture.

You swing your weapon in a wide, deadly arc. With your supreme skill and martial training, you aim your attack so that as you strike one opponent, you set yourself up perfectly to make a second attack against a different foe. As your weapon strikes one opponent, it cuts into him, then ricochets to your second target. If the first melee attack you make during your turn hits, you can immediately make a free attack at your highest attack bonus against a different enemy that you threaten. You can only gain one free attack each time you initiate this maneuver, regardless of how many successful attacks you make in this round.

The Iron Heart discipline teaches focus, allowing you to engage and defeat one opponent at a time. Your other enemies mean nothing to you as you press your attack. You make a single melee attack as part of this strike. You gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll. All opponents other than the one you attacked gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls against you for 1 round.

Your blade lashes out to absorb or deflect each attack you face, blunting the force of your enemies' blows. As a student of the Iron Heart discipline, you learn that a simple flick of the wrist or turn of the blade can transform a deadly strike into a wild miss. In battle, you enter a steady rhythm that makes you frustratingly difficult to fight. You disrupt each attack with a perfectly timed counter, leaving your foes' strikes weak and ineffectual. While you are in this stance, you gain damage reduction 5/- against any opponent that does not catch you flat-footed. To gain this benefit, you must be proficient with the weapon you carry. You gain this benefit while unarmed only if you have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.

With the speed of a thunderbolt, you clash your weapon against your foe's blade as he attempts to attack. Your weapon mastery transforms your blade into an extension of your arm, allowing you to wield it with the speed and timing needed to make a precise block. When an enemy makes a melee or ranged attack against you, you can initiate this counter to oppose that attack by making an attack roll with any melee weapon you are holding. Use the higher of your AC or your attack roll as your effective AC against the incoming attack. You can't use this maneuver if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacker. You can decide to use this ability after you learn the result of your opponent's attack.

Your foe hesitates, unsure of how to attack you in this unlikely stance. If your opponent strikes you on his turn, you can replace your AC with the result of a Sense Motive check as an immediate action. You must decide whether to initiate this maneuver before you know the result of your opponent's attack (but after the attack is declared). Your Sense Motive check applies to only one attack. You must be aware of the attack to which you will apply the effect of this maneuver. If you are flat-footed against the incoming attack, you cannot use this maneuver.

This maneuver functions like mighty throw (page 73), except as noted here. As part of this maneuver, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against your foe. You can then make a trip attempt against your enemy. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him in a 60-foot line. The target and all creatures in this area take 6d6 points of damage. The thrown creature lands prone at the end of this line. You must place the target in an empty space. If the space at the end of the line is occupied, your opponent falls prone in the open space closest to the line's endpoint.
Clever Positioning											CLASSES:Swordsage=2				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One creature																SAVEINFO:Reflex partial													SOURCEPAGE:p.70	DESC:With a swift flurry of motion, you knock you foe off balance, slip into his space, and force him into the spot you just occupied. You make a melee attack, and while your opponent is slightly off balance from your blow, you find the leverage needed to pull him into your space while moving into his space. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against a target. If your attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Reflex save (DC 12 + your Dex modifier). If this save fails, you swap positions with the target. If the target is Large or larger, you can occupy any of the squares that make up its space. The target must in turn occupy the square, or one of the squares, you previously occupied. You cannot use this maneuver if you or the target would end up sharing the same space as another creature or an impassable terrain feature, such as a wall. If your target occupies a larger space than you do, he chooses his final position according to the guidelines given above.
Comet Throw													CLASSES:Swordsage=4				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched; see text													SAVEINFO:Reflex partial; see text					PRESPELLSCHOOL:1,Setting Sun=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:You use your foe's momentum against him, throwing him through the air to crash into a second enemy. This maneuver functions like mighty throw (page 73), except as noted here. As part of this maneuver, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against your foe. You can then make a trip attempt against your enemy. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 10 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. You select your enemy's destination square. The target falls prone in that space and takes 4d6 points of damage. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw range. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you. You can throw your opponent into a space occupied by a second foe. In this case, the opponent in the target square also takes 4d6 points of damage and is knocked prone. A Reflex save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) halves this damage and allows the second target to remain standing. The thrown creature then falls prone in a clear space of your choice adjacent to the second target.
Counter Charge												CLASSES:Swordsage=1				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Counter								CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One creature																																SOURCEPAGE:p.71	DESC:With a quick sidestep, you send a charging opponent sprawling. With this counter, you can attempt to redirect a creature that intends to make a charge attack against you. Immediately before the creature makes its charge attack, make your choice of an opposed Strength or Dexterity check against it. The target makes its check using the same ability you chose for your check. If you are of a larger size category than the attacking creature, you use your superior bulk to redirect your foe and gain a +4 bonus on your Strength check (if you opt for a Strength check). If you are of a smaller size category, you use leverage, misdirection, and trickery to gain a +4 bonus on your Dexterity check (if you use that option). If you succeed on the Strength or Dexterity check, the creature does not get to attack you. You can then move it up to 2 squares in a direction of your choice away from you. If you fail the Strength or Dexterity check, the creature gains a +2 bonus on its charge attack, in addition to the normal +2 bonus from taking the charge attack action.

You must place the target in an empty space. If you lack the distance to throw your target into a clear space, he falls prone in his current space.
Feigned Opening												CLASSES:Swordsage=3				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Counter								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You																											PRESPELLSCHOOL:1,Setting Sun=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:You show your opponent a seemingly fatal mistake in your defenses, but easily avoid the ensuing attack and simultaneously draw your foe into overextending. As she fights to regain her balance, you make a swift counterattack. You can use this maneuver when an opponent attempts an attack of opportunity against you. As you provoke the attack of opportunity, you position yourself in such a way as to force your opponent to throw herself off balance to strike you. Even if she succeeds in striking you, your foe might regret her attack as your allies leap in to finish her. When your enemy makes an attack of opportunity against you, but before you know the result of the attack, you can initiate this maneuver. If her attack misses, she provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If her attack of opportunity hits you, she provokes an attack of opportunity from any of your allies who threaten her.

When an enemy attacks you on its turn, you can attempt to block the blow and send it back at that creature. You step into the attack and redirect it. This maneuver pits your skill against that of your foe. If an opponent attacks you, you can initiate this maneuver to make an opposed attack roll as an immediate action. If your foe's result is higher, he attacks you as normal. If your result is higher, your foe rolls damage as normal for the attack and takes that much damage.
Ghostly Defense												CLASSES:Swordsage=8				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Stance								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:Stance																PRESPELLSCHOOL:3,Setting Sun=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:You lurk within concealing mist, luring your opponent into attacking you, only to dodge out of the way and direct your enemy's blow at an unwitting ally. You are a ghost in the mist, capable of turning a foe against her allies. By gauging your opponent's fighting stance, timing your dodge correctly, and placing yourself in the right position, you can lead her into attacking one of her allies rather than you. When your foe strikes, you duck out of the way. As she follows through with her attack, she inadvertently attacks an ally. You gain this stance's benefit when an opponent's attack against you has a miss chance, such as from concealment. Whenever an opponent's melee or ranged attack misses you because of this miss chance, you can choose to change the target of the attack from you to another eligible target (other than your attacker). For a melee attack, the new target must be within your opponent's reach and adjacent to you. For a ranged attack, the new target must be adjacent to you, and your opponent must have line of effect to him. Use the result of the original attack to determine if it hits the new target. Your foe does not check again for a miss chance, as you guide the attack directly to the new target. This ability applies only once per attack. If you use ghostly defense to redirect an attack against a foe using this stance, he does not have the option to redirect the attack again. You must be aware of an opponent's attack to gain the benefit of this stance. You cannot use it against attacks that catch you flat-footed.
Giant Killing Style											CLASSES:Swordsage=3				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Stance								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:Stance																PRESPELLSCHOOL:1,Setting Sun=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:You dart between a giant's legs, lashing at his inner ankles and other vulnerable areas while staying inside his reach where he cannot hope to parry your attacks. The Setting Sun school teaches a fighting style that emphasizes using an opponent's strength and momentum against him. The giant killing strike epitomizes this approach. By sizing up a larger opponent and studying his fighting stance and tendencies, you aim your strikes at vulnerable points on his lower body that he cannot defend effectively. You slice at tendons on your foe's feet, smash his knees, and cut into his hamstrings. When you are in this stance, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage rolls against opponents of a larger size category than yours. This bonus applies to all attacks you make for the rest of your turn.
Hydra Slaying Strike											CLASSES:Swordsage=7				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One creature																										PRESPELLSCHOOL:3,Setting Sun=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:You take stock of an opponent's fighting style and make a single, carefully aimed attack that leaves the creature unable to make all of its attacks. You take careful aim at an enemy creature, striking it with the precise amount of force needed to push it off guard and leave it unable to bring all of its attacks to bear. Your opponent must spend critical seconds adjusting its guard and reevaluating its surroundings. As part of this maneuver, make a single melee attack. If this attack hits, your target takes normal damage and cannot make a full attack on its next turn. Otherwise, it can act normally.
Mighty Throw												CLASSES:Swordsage=1				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch					TARGETAREA:Creature touched																															SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:You use superior leverage and your Setting Sun training to send an opponent tumbling to the ground. As part of this maneuver, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against your foe. Resolve the throw as a trip attempt (PH 158), but you do not provoke attacks of opportunity, and your opponent cannot try to trip you if you lose the opposed check. You can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is higher. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw it up to 10 feet away from you. The target falls prone in the destination space. You choose where it lands. You must place the target in an empty space. If you lack the distance to throw your target into a clear space, it falls prone in its current space. An enemy you throw with this maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity for passing through enemies' threatened areas as part of the throw, and you can throw an enemy through occupied squares.

Your keen eye and ability to discern a foe's motives and intentions allow you to deflect an incoming attack into a different target. If an opponent attacks you, you can initiate this maneuver to make an opposed attack roll as an immediate action. If your foe's result is higher, he attacks you as normal. If your result is higher, you can choose a creature adjacent to you and within your opponent's threatened area. The chosen creature is the new target of your foe's attack. Use your enemy's original attack roll result to determine if he strikes the new target.
Shifting Defense												CLASSES:Swordsage=5				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Stance								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:Stance																PRESPELLSCHOOL:2,Setting Sun=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.73	DESC:You duck and move as you dodge your opponent's attacks. Slowly but surely, each attack gives you the opportunity to move across the battlefield. Your ability to read your opponents' moves and use their strength against them allows you to shift your position during a battle. Each failed attack gives you the split-second you need to move without drawing attacks. While you are in this stance, you can make an immediate 5-foot step each time an opponent attacks you. Moving in this manner consumes one of your attacks of opportunity in the currrent round. You cannot move in this manner if you have no attacks of opportunity remaining. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

You can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier, 74 Maneuvers and Stances whichever is better. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 20 feet away from you. The target falls prone in the destination space and takes 8d6 points of damage. You choose where he lands. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw distance. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 30 feet of you. You must place the target in an empty space. If you lack the distance to throw your target into a clear space, he falls prone in his current space. An enemy you throw with this maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity for passing through enemies' threatened areas as part of the throw, and you can throw an enemy through occupied squares.

Using your watchful eye and your ability to judge an opponent's actions, you move at precisely the same time your enemy begins to move. If an opponent in a square adjacent to you moves, you can initiate this maneuver to make a 5-foot step into the space (or one of the squares) it occupied. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Step of the Wind												CLASSES:Swordsage=1				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Stance								CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal				TARGETAREA:You									DURATION:Stance																						SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:You walk across rubble and other broken terrain with deceptive ease, allowing you to take advantage of your opponents as they struggle to move at full speed. You are so closely attuned to your environment that you easily pick out steady spots in rough terrain. While others struggle to move over broken ground, you slip across it with ease. When you fight on rough ground, you turn the uneven footing into an advantage. By gauging how an opponent distributes his weight, you strike at just the right moment and in the precise spot needed to send him tumbling to the ground. While you are in this stance, you ignore penalties to speed, movement, or skill checks associated with movement (such as Tumble, Jump, and Climb checks) incurred by moving through difficult terrain. If you attack an opponent standing on difficult terrain while you are in this stance, and if that foe takes a movement penalty for moving through difficult terrain, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on Strength or Dexterity checks made as part of a bull rush or trip attempt against that enemy.

While he struggles to ready himself, he becomes more vulnerable to your attacks. As part of this maneuver, make a single melee attack. This attack deals an extra 4d6 points of damage. In addition, the target must make a Reflex save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) or become flatfooted until the start of his next turn. The target takes damage (normal melee damage plus the extra damage) even if his save succeeds. If the target cannot be caught flat-footed (he has uncanny dodge, for example), he still takes the extra damage from the strike but otherwise suffers no ill effect.
Tornado Throw												CLASSES:Swordsage=9				SCHOOL:Setting Sun	SUBSCHOOL:Strike								CASTTIME:1 full-round action	RANGE:Melee attack			TARGETAREA:One or more creatures																								PRESPELLSCHOOL:5,Setting Sun=1	SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:Like a whirlwind, you twist and spin across the battlefield, tossing foes away left and right. As part of initiating this maneuver, you move up to your opponent, throw her aside, and move again. You must move at least 10 feet before making your throw. This movement and your movement after your throw provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. You can move up to double your speed as part of this maneuver. If you fail in your throw attempt, you can still move afterward. After every 10 feet you move, you can attempt another throw against the same opponent or a different foe. To make your throw attempt, you must succeed on a melee touch attack. Resolve the throw as a trip attempt (PH 158), but you do not provoke attacks of opportunity, and your opponent cannot try to trip you if you lose the opposed check. You can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier on this check, whichever is better. You gain a +2 bonus on this check for every 5 feet that you have moved during your turn. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 10 feet away from you. The target falls prone in the destination space and takes 2d6 points of damage. You choose where he lands. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw distance and the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you, and he takes a total of 4d6 points of damage. You must place the target in an empty space. If you lack the distance to throw your target into a clear space, he falls prone in his current space. An enemy you throw with this maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity for passing through enemies' threatened areas as part of the throw, and you can throw an enemy through occupied squares.

Each negative level gives a creature a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from her highest available level. Negative levels stack.

As you make your attack, both your true weapon and the illusion slash at your foe. This maneuver allows you to create a mystical double of your weapon.

In this case, the shadow blade discharges its magic and imbues your attack with cold energy. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent. Unlike on a normal attack, you roll 2d20 and select which of the two die results to use. If you use the higher die result, resolve your attack as normal.

If you use the lower die result, or if both die results are the same, your attack deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage as both the mystic double's attack and your true weapon strike home.

Your next attack drops like an avalanche upon your foe, hammering him into submission. The students of the Stone Dragon discipline learn to tap into the power of the earth, channel its endless strength, and use it to grant their attacks tremendous force. A strike delivered by a Stone Dragon adept can shatter a warrior's shield, turn a wooden door into splinters, or slay an ogre with a single blow. When you use this maneuver, you make a single melee attack. That attack deals an extra 6d6 points of damage and automatically overcomes damage reduction and hardness.

A warrior with less skill would lose his balance and fall to the ground when using this fighting style. While you are in this stance, you deal damage as if you were one size larger than normal, to a maximum of Large. This benefit improves your weapon and unarmed strike damage. It does not confer any of the other benefits or drawbacks of a change in size, such as a modifier to ability scores or AC, or an improved reach.

In the face of a daunting enemy or unexpected hardship, the most skilled warrior is worthless if he lacks strength of will. When you adopt the bolstering voice stance, you shout encouragement to your allies, disparage your foes, and lend much-needed support to raise your allies' spirits. By drawing on the example you set, your allies harden their will to fight and battle on despite your enemies' attempts to turn them aside.
