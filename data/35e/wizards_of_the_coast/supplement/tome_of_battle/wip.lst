The fire flows back to the ground and creeps ahead like a serpent, sweeping over your enemies and roasting them where they stand. When you initiate this maneuver, you cause a line of fire to twist across an area to burn your enemies. This line is 60 feet long. Unlike a standard line, a firesnake can bend and twist to hit your foes. A firesnake starts in an adjacent square. It can move up to 60 feet each round.

While you are in this stance, your attacks have the potential to be utterly devastating. When rolling damage for a melee attack, you gain a special benefit from any damage die that rolls its maximum amount (such as a result of 6 on a d6). When one or more of your damage dice show a maximum possible result, reroll each such die and add its result to the original damage total. You can continue to reroll as long as a die shows its maximum possible result, adding each new number to the damage total until each die has shown less than a maximum result.

If you hit your opponent and his alignment has at least one component different from yours, a blast of divine energy originates from your attack's point of impact. The target of this strike takes an extra 8d6 points of damage and must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 17 + your Cha modifier) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 minute. All of your opponents within a 30- foot-radius burst of the target creature must also succeed on a Fortitude save.

When your blows strike home, you send your foe tumbling back on the defensive. He must deal with you first, or leave himself open to your deadly counter. Defensive rebuke allows you to excel at controlling the battlefield around you. Your enemies must pay heed to the threat you pose. If they ignore you in favor of attacking other targets, you take advantage of their lapses with a punishing counterattack. Each enemy you strike after you initiate this maneuver becomes vulnerable to your further attacks. If such an opponent attacks anyone other than you in melee for the duration of the maneuver, that attack provokes an attack of opportunity from you (each separate attack a target makes provokes an attack of opportunity, making this boost especially lethal if you have Combat Reflexes). Enemies you strike become aware of the consequences of the maneuver.

In addition, before making this melee attack, you can also decide to take a number of points of Constitution damage equal to your initiator level or lower. For each point of Constitution damage you take, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll and deal an extra 2d8 points of damage.

As part of this maneuver, you make a melee attack against an opponent. Your attack deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. In addition, if your attack hits, your target's speed is reduced by 20 feet until the end of its next turn, which might prevent it from moving entirely. This penalty applies to all movement modes. A flying creature with a fly speed of 0 feet falls to the ground (and takes falling damage appropriately) if it is subject to this effect while in the air.

Your devotion to your cause gives you boundless energy that allows you to smash through supernatural defenses. When you land an attack, you hit with such force that damage reduction offers little resistance against you. When you use this maneuver, you make a melee attack against a single foe. This attack automatically overcomes the opponent's damage reduction and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.						
IMMORTAL FORTITUDE	CATEGORY:Maneuvers and Stances	TYPE:MartialManeuver.Crusader Martial Maneuver.Devoted Spirit.Stance	SOURCEPAGE:p.59	SPELLKNOWN:CLASS|Crusader=8|IMMORTAL FORTITUDE	PREVARGTEQ:CrusaderInitiatorManeuverLVL,8	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=Maneuvers and Stances,TYPE.Devoted Spirit Maneuver	ASPECT:Initiation Action|1 swift action	ASPECT:Range|Personal	ASPECT:Target Area|You	ASPECT:Duration|Stance	DESC:Despite the horrific wounds you suffer, the flash of searing spells, and the crash of a foe's mighty attacks, you stand resolute on the field. So long as the potential for victory exists, you fight on. Death has little meaning to you in light of the cause you fight for. So long as the mission stands before you uncompleted, or a battle remains in doubt, you fight on. Stories abound of crusaders who, while in the grips of this stance, fought for days on end to hold a mountain pass against orcs, trolls, and other fiends. So long as you remain in this stance, you cannot be killed or incapacitated by effects or attacks that reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points. If you take such damage, you can make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to your negative hit point total. If you fail this save, you die or fall unconscious (as appropriate). If this save is successful, you are still alive and conscious, with 1 hit point remaining. This stance provides no protection against effects that slay you without dealing hit point damage, or other effects that petrify, paralyze, and so forth. You can still be slain by a coup de grace if a spell or effect renders you helpless. After you attempt three saving throws to avoid death or unconsciousness, this stance automatically ends. You can activate it again on your turn as normal. Even the toughest crusader can endure only so much punishment.

Rather than strike his original target, your enemy turns his attention toward you. While you are in this stance, any opponent that you threaten takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls against your allies. This penalty does not apply to attacks made against you. Enemies you threaten become aware of the consequences of the stance.

While you are in this stance, you or an ally within 30 feet heals 2 points of damage each time you make a successful melee attack. This healing represents the vigor, drive, and toughness you inspire in others. Your connection to the divine causes such inspiration to have a real, tangible effect on your allies' health. Each time you hit an opponent in melee, you can choose a different recipient within range to receive this healing.

You know that a mix of mental acuity and martial training, along with a strong sword arm, is an unbeatable combination. This maneuver epitomizes your approach. Your mind, rather than your raw reflexes, dictates your defenses. You can use this maneuver any time you would be required to make a Reflex save. Roll a Concentration check instead of the Reflex save and use the result of that check to determine the save's success. You must use this maneuver before you roll the Reflex save.

Your speed, reflexes, and boundless confidence combine to allow you to make a fast, bold move that catches your foes off guard. With a burst of energy, you move forward to press an attack, draw an item from your backpack, or take some other move action. Your training, mental acuity, and drive allow you to move with greater speed and confidence than other warriors. This maneuver requires a swift action to initiate. You can take a free move action after you initiate this maneuver. You can use any of the options available for a move action. You can then use the rest of your actions as normal. For example, you could use this maneuver to move next to a foe, then take a full attack action. You could move, then make a charge attack, and so forth. The move action you gain from this maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

This maneuver allows you to make a free attack against a reckless enemy. When a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you can initiate this maneuver. As part of this maneuver, you make an immediate melee attack against the foe that provoked the attack of opportunity. This attack does not replace the normal attack of opportunity you receive. You can also use this maneuver before making your normal attack of opportunity when an opponent provokes (or vice versa). The attack granted by the maneuver is not an extra attack of opportunity. You can initiate this maneuver before, after, in addition to, or instead of making an attack of opportunity against an opponent (thus possibly saving your attack of opportunity to use against another enemy later in the round).

The ruby nightmare blade is a favored finishing move of warriors who study the Diamond Mind discipline. By intently analyzing your foe's stance and moves, you find the precise spot that you must strike to end the fight with a decisive blow. You attempt a Concentration check as part of this maneuver, using the target creature's AC as the DC of the check. You then make a single melee attack against your target. This attack is also made as part of this maneuver. If your Concentration check succeeds, this melee attack deals double normal melee damage. If your check fails, your attack is made with a -2 penalty and deals only normal melee damage. If your strike is a critical hit, you stack the multipliers as normal (PH 304).

The sapphire nightmare blade is one of the most basic, but important, maneuvers that a Diamond Mind adept studies. It illustrates that a keen mind can pierce even the toughest defenses. You attempt a Concentration check as part of this maneuver, using the target creature's AC as the DC of the check. You then make a single melee attack against your target. The attack is also part of this maneuver. If your Concentration check succeeds, the target is flat-footed against your attack, and you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage.

You move slightly faster than normal due to a combination of confidence, training, and clarity of mind. This slight edge adds up with each action. Your mental swiftness translates to physical action on the battlefield. You are constantly on edge, allowing you to react to multiple attacks and threats. Most warriors can only manage a single counter move each round. While you are in this stance, you can use one counter per round without taking an immediate action. You cannot use the same maneuver two times in a round. In essence, one counter you use during the round does not require an immediate action. If you have already taken an immediate action within the past round, such as casting a feather fall spell, you can still use this stance to initiate a counter.

Your other opponents fade from sight as your mind locks onto your target. This stance allows you to focus on a single opponent to the exclusion of all others. You read your foe's fighting stance, his favored attacks, and the methods he used to train. By combining these factors into a single analysis of his abilities, you see how to foil his attacks. While you are in this stance, you must choose a single opponent as your target at the start of your turn. You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC against that foe until you change the target of this stance. You take a -2 penalty to AC against all other opponents while using stance of clarity.

You move like a blur, catching your enemies by surprise with a complex action carried out in a tiny fraction of the time normally needed to complete it. In an unmatched burst of speed, agility, and decisive action, you move more quickly than the eye can follow. You can lash out with your blade, striking your opponent so rapidly that observers can't keep track of your moves. As part of this maneuver, you can use a full attack action two times in succession. Take your first full attack as normal. Once you have resolved those attacks, you can then take another full attack action. You must resolve these actions separately. You cannot combine the attacks provided by both actions as you wish. Instead, you must take them separately and in order as normal for a full attack.

When a spell or other attack strikes you, you move a split second before you are even aware of the threat. Your mind is a keenly honed weapon. Other warriors rely on their physical talents. You know that a mix of mental acuity and martial training, along with a strong sword arm, is an unbeatable combination. This maneuver epitomizes your approach. Your mind, rather than your raw reflexes, dictates your defenses. You can use this maneuver any time you would be required to make a Reflex save. Roll a Concentration check instead of the Reflex save and use the result of that check to determine the save's success. You must use this maneuver before you roll the Reflex save. A result of a natural 1 on your Concentration check is not an automatic failure.

You lash at an opponent. If your attack hits, you repeat the same attack again and again at nearly superhuman speed, allowing you to score multiple hits in a blur of activity. Unfortunately, as soon as an attack misses, your tempo breaks, and this delicate maneuver crumbles into a flurry of wasted motion. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent. If that attack hits, resolve your damage as normal. You can then make another attack against that foe with a -4 penalty on your attack roll. If that attack hits, you can make another attack against that opponent with a -8 penalty. You continue to make additional attacks, each one with an additional -4 penalty, until you miss or your opponent is reduced to -1 hit points or fewer.

When you initiate this maneuver, your initiative count improves by 20, and your place in the initiative order changes accordingly. This modifier applies at the end of the round. Your place in the initiative order changes to reflect moment of alacrity's effect starting with the next round.

When someone targets you with a spell that seeks to erode your willpower, you steel yourself against the attack. Between your devoted study, iron will, and supreme focus, you have learned to resist attempts to subvert your willpower. When you feel such an effect try to cloud your mind, you can draw on untapped reserves of energy to counter the attempt. You can use this maneuver any time you would be required to make a Will save. Make a Concentration check instead of the Will save and use the result of that check to determine the save's success. You must use this maneuver before you attempt the Will save. A result of a natural 1 on your Concentration check is not an automatic failure.

You prey on your opponents' fear and lack of confidence. Each failed attack against you reminds them that their skill cannot hope to match yours. When you enter this stance, you become more difficult to hit with each successive attack that misses you. Each time an opponent misses you with a melee attack, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn and is cumulative for the round. The bonus applies to any attacks made by all opponents until the beginning of your next turn.

Your speed, reflexes, and boundless confidence combine to allow you to make a fast, bold move that catches your foes off guard. With a burst of energy, you move forward to press an attack, draw an item from your backpack, or take some other move action. Your training, mental acuity, and drive allow you to move with greater speed and confidence than other warriors. This maneuver requires a swift action to initiate. You can take a free move action after you initiate this maneuver. You can use any of the options available for a move action. You can then use the rest of your actions as normal. For example, you could use this maneuver to move next to a foe, then take a full attack action. You could move, then make a charge attack, and so forth. The move action you gain from this maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

This maneuver allows you to make a free attack against a reckless enemy. When a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you can initiate this maneuver. As part of this maneuver, you make an immediate melee attack against the foe that provoked the attack of opportunity. This attack does not replace the normal attack of opportunity you receive. You can also use this maneuver before making your normal attack of opportunity when an opponent provokes (or vice versa). The attack granted by the maneuver is not an extra attack of opportunity. You can initiate this maneuver before, after, in addition to, or instead of making an attack of opportunity against an opponent (thus possibly saving your attack of opportunity to use against another enemy later in the round).

The ruby nightmare blade is a favored finishing move of warriors who study the Diamond Mind discipline. By intently analyzing your foe's stance and moves, you find the precise spot that you must strike to end the fight with a decisive blow. You attempt a Concentration check as part of this maneuver, using the target creature's AC as the DC of the check. You then make a single melee attack against your target. This attack is also made as part of this maneuver. If your Concentration check succeeds, this melee attack deals double normal melee damage. If your check fails, your attack is made with a -2 penalty and deals only normal melee damage. If your strike is a critical hit, you stack the multipliers as normal (PH 304).

The sapphire nightmare blade is one of the most basic, but important, maneuvers that a Diamond Mind adept studies. It illustrates that a keen mind can pierce even the toughest defenses. You attempt a Concentration check as part of this maneuver, using the target creature's AC as the DC of the check. You then make a single melee attack against your target. The attack is also part of this maneuver. If your Concentration check succeeds, the target is flat-footed against your attack, and you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage. If your check fails, your attack is made with a -2 penalty and deals normal damage.

You move slightly faster than normal due to a combination of confidence, training, and clarity of mind. This slight edge adds up with each action. Your mental swiftness translates to physical action on the battlefield. You are constantly on edge, allowing you to react to multiple attacks and threats. Most warriors can only manage a single counter move each round. While you are in this stance, you can use one counter per round without taking an immediate action. You cannot use the same maneuver two times in a round. In essence, one counter you use during the round does not require an immediate action. If you have already taken an immediate action within the past round, such as casting a feather fall spell, you can still use this stance to initiate a counter.

Your other opponents fade from sight as your mind locks onto your target. This stance allows you to focus on a single opponent to the exclusion of all others. You read your foe's fighting stance, his favored attacks, and the methods he used to train. By combining these factors into a single analysis of his abilities, you see how to foil his attacks. While you are in this stance, you must choose a single opponent as your target at the start of your turn. You gain a +2 insight bonus to AC against that foe until you change the target of this stance. You take a -2 penalty to AC against all other opponents while using stance of clarity.

You move like a blur, catching your enemies by surprise with a complex action carried out in a tiny fraction of the time normally needed to complete it. In an unmatched burst of speed, agility, and decisive action, you move more quickly than the eye can follow. You can lash out with your blade, striking your opponent so rapidly that observers can't keep track of your moves. As part of this maneuver, you can use a full attack action two times in succession. Take your first full attack as normal. Once you have resolved those attacks, you can then take another full attack action. You must resolve these actions separately. You cannot combine the attacks provided by both actions as you wish. Instead, you must take them separately and in order as normal for a full attack.

You move quickly, keep a sharp eye on your enemies, and are ready to instantly sidestep any incoming attacks. While you are in this stance, you gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed. If you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn.

As you turn, your weapon flashes through the enemies around you like a blazing comet. As you drop back to the ground in your fighting stance, your enemies crumple to the ground around you. You sweep your weapon in a circle around you, striking out at nearby enemies. You strike with the speed and ferocity of a lightning bolt, forcing your enemies to rely on their reflexes for protection rather than their armor and shields. You make two melee attacks against each adjacent opponent you threaten when you initiate this maneuver. You receive a +4 bonus on each of these attacks, which are otherwise made with your highest attack bonus.

Your foe stumbles backward, surprised that you could reach him from such a great distance. By carefully distributing your weight and establishing a steady, rugged posture, you can reach out and strike opponents with your melee attacks at a greater than normal distance. A warrior with less training and expertise would fall flat on his face attempting this maneuver. You, on the other hand, have the grace, focus, and skill needed to complete this complex move. While you are in this stance, you gain a bonus to your reach during your turn. When you make a melee attack, your reach increases by 5 feet. Your reach is not improved when it is not your turn, such as when you make an attack of opportunity. You cannot improve your reach by more than 5 feet by using this ability in conjunction with other maneuvers.

The proper application of force to just the right part of a foe's anatomy allows you to disrupt his actions. While he stumbles back, senseless, you press the advantage. You make a single melee attack as part of this strike. If this attack hits, the target takes melee damage normally and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 + your Str modifier) or be dazed for 1 round.

If this attack hits and deals damage, you can also attempt to disarm your opponent (PH 155). This disarm attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity, nor is there any risk that your foe can disarm you.

Your mastery of the Iron Heart style has taught you much about the power within a blade, and you can use this knowledge to not only enhance your own ability but also to deprive others of that power. When you initiate this maneuver, you attack your opponent's weapon (PH 158). This attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you succeed, your foe takes a -4 penalty on melee damage rolls for 1 minute. The wielder of the weapon can attempt a Will save (DC 13 + your Str modifier) to halve this penalty.

Iron Heart teaches that it is best to finish off a foe with as little effort as possible, the better to save your strength for your remaining enemies. When you use this maneuver, you throw yourself on the offensive with little thought to your defenses. If this attack strikes home, it might end a fight several crucial seconds early. As part of this maneuver, you make a melee attack against a creature. This attack deals an extra 4d6 points of damage. If the target's current hit points are less than its full normal hit points, the attack instead deals an extra 6d6 points of damage.

If your result is greater than your foe's attack roll, you bat aside the strike and direct it against a target of your choice that stands adjacent to you. You must decide whether to initiate this maneuver after the enemy attacks, but before you know whether or not the attack you are attempting to deflect actually hits.

However, this fighting stance leaves you vulnerable to an opponent's attacks. Only an initiate of the Iron Heart tradition can manage the perilous balance between trading attack power for defense. A lesser warrior would leave himself nearly helpless to resist an opponent's attacks. While you are in this stance, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with all melee attacks.

Your blade lashes out to absorb or deflect each attack you face, blunting the force of your enemies' blows. As a student of the Iron Heart discipline, you learn that a simple flick of the wrist or turn of the blade can transform a deadly strike into a wild miss. In battle, you enter a steady rhythm that makes you frustratingly difficult to fight. You disrupt each attack with a perfectly timed counter, leaving your foes' strikes weak and ineffectual. While you are in this stance, you gain damage reduction 5/- against any opponent that does not catch you flat-footed. To gain this benefit, you must be proficient with the weapon you carry. You gain this benefit while unarmed only if you have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.

With the speed of a thunderbolt, you clash your weapon against your foe's blade as he attempts to attack. Your weapon mastery transforms your blade into an extension of your arm, allowing you to wield it with the speed and timing needed to make a precise block. When an enemy makes a melee or ranged attack against you, you can initiate this counter to oppose that attack by making an attack roll with any melee weapon you are holding. Use the higher of your AC or your attack roll as your effective AC against the incoming attack. You can't use this maneuver if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacker. You can decide to use this ability after you learn the result of your opponent's attack.

You make a melee attack, and while your opponent is slightly off balance from your blow, you find the leverage needed to pull him into your space while moving into his space. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against a target. If your attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a Reflex save (DC 12 + your Dex modifier). If this save fails, you swap positions with the target. If the target is Large or larger, you can occupy any of the squares that make up its space. The target must in turn occupy the square, or one of the squares, you previously occupied. You cannot use this maneuver if you or the target would end up sharing the same space as another creature or an impassable terrain feature, such as a wall.

This maneuver functions like mighty throw (page 73), except as noted here. As part of this maneuver, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against your foe. You can then make a trip attempt against your enemy. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 10 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. You select your enemy's destination square. The target falls prone in that space and takes 4d6 points of damage. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw range. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you. You can throw your opponent into a space occupied by a second foe. In this case, the opponent in the target square also takes 4d6 points of damage and is knocked prone. A Reflex save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) halves this damage and allows the second target to remain standing. The thrown creature then falls prone in a clear space of your choice adjacent to the second target.

With this counter, you can attempt to redirect a creature that intends to make a charge attack against you. Immediately before the creature makes its charge attack, make your choice of an opposed Strength or Dexterity check against it. The target makes its check using the same ability you chose for your check. If you are of a larger size category than the attacking creature, you use your superior bulk to redirect your foe and gain a +4 bonus on your Strength check (if you opt for a Strength check). If you are of a smaller size category, you use leverage, misdirection, and trickery to gain a +4 bonus on your Dexterity check (if you use that option). If you succeed on the Strength or Dexterity check, the creature does not get to attack you. You can then move it up to 2 squares in a direction of your choice away from you. If you fail the Strength or Dexterity check, the creature gains a +2 bonus on its charge attack, in addition to the normal +2 bonus from taking the charge attack action.

As part of this maneuver, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against your foe. You can then make a trip attempt against your enemy. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 10 feet away from you. The target falls prone in the destination space and takes 2d6 points of damage. You choose where he lands. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw distance. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you. You must place the target in an empty space. If you lack the distance to throw your target into a clear space, he falls prone in his current space.

As she fights to regain her balance, you make a swift counterattack. You can use this maneuver when an opponent attempts an attack of opportunity against you. As you provoke the attack of opportunity, you position yourself in such a way as to force your opponent to throw herself off balance to strike you. Even if she succeeds in striking you, your foe might regret her attack as your allies leap in to finish her. When your enemy makes an attack of opportunity against you, but before you know the result of the attack, you can initiate this maneuver. If her attack misses, she provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If her attack of opportunity hits you, she provokes an attack of opportunity from any of your allies who threaten her.

When an enemy attacks you on its turn, you can attempt to block the blow and send it back at that creature. You step into the attack and redirect it. This maneuver pits your skill against that of your foe. If an opponent attacks you, you can initiate this maneuver to make an opposed attack roll as an immediate action. If your foe's result is higher, he attacks you as normal. If your result is higher, your foe rolls damage as normal for the attack and takes that much damage.

You are a ghost in the mist, capable of turning a foe against her allies. By gauging your opponent's fighting stance, timing your dodge correctly, and placing yourself in the right position, you can lead her into attacking one of her allies rather than you. When your foe strikes, you duck out of the way. As she follows through with her attack, she inadvertently attacks an ally. You gain this stance's benefit when an opponent's attack against you has a miss chance, such as from concealment. Whenever an opponent's melee or ranged attack misses you because of this miss chance, you can choose to change the target of the attack from you to another eligible target (other than your attacker). For a melee attack, the new target must be within your opponent's reach and adjacent to you. For a ranged attack, the new target must be adjacent to you, and your opponent must have line of effect to him. Use the result of the original attack to determine if it hits the new target. Your foe does not check again for a miss chance, as you guide the attack directly to the new target. This ability applies only once per attack. If you use ghostly defense to redirect an attack against a foe using this stance, he does not have the option to redirect the attack again. You must be aware of an opponent's attack to gain the benefit of this stance. You cannot use it against attacks that catch you flat-footed.

The Setting Sun school teaches a fighting style that emphasizes using an opponent's strength and momentum against him. The giant killing strike epitomizes this approach. By sizing up a larger opponent and studying his fighting stance and tendencies, you aim your strikes at vulnerable points on his lower body that he cannot defend effectively. You slice at tendons on your foe's feet, smash his knees, and cut into his hamstrings. When you are in this stance, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage rolls against opponents of a larger size category than yours. This bonus applies to all attacks you make for the rest of your turn.

You take careful aim at an enemy creature, striking it with the precise amount of force needed to push it off guard and leave it unable to bring all of its attacks to bear. Your opponent must spend critical seconds adjusting its guard and reevaluating its surroundings. As part of this maneuver, make a single melee attack. If this attack hits, your target takes normal damage and cannot make a full attack on its next turn. Otherwise, it can act normally.

As part of this maneuver, you must succeed on a melee touch attack against your foe. Resolve the throw as a trip attempt (PH 158), but you do not provoke attacks of opportunity, and your opponent cannot try to trip you if you lose the opposed check. You can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is higher. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw it up to 10 feet away from you. The target falls prone in the destination space. You choose where it lands. You must place the target in an empty space. If you lack the distance to throw your target into a clear space, it falls prone in its current space. An enemy you throw with this maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity for passing through enemies' threatened areas as part of the throw, and you can throw an enemy through occupied squares.

If an opponent attacks you, you can initiate this maneuver to make an opposed attack roll as an immediate action. If your foe's result is higher, he attacks you as normal.

Slowly but surely, each attack gives you the opportunity to move across the battlefield. Your ability to read your opponents' moves and use their strength against them allows you to shift your position during a battle. Each failed attack gives you the split-second you need to move without drawing attacks. While you are in this stance, you can make an immediate 5-foot step each time an opponent attacks you. Moving in this manner consumes one of your attacks of opportunity in the currrent round. You cannot move in this manner if you have no attacks of opportunity remaining.

You can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier, 74 Maneuvers and Stances whichever is better. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check. If you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 20 feet away from you. The target falls prone in the destination space and takes 8d6 points of damage. You choose where he lands.

You are so closely attuned to your environment that you easily pick out steady spots in rough terrain. While others struggle to move over broken ground, you slip across it with ease. When you fight on rough ground, you turn the uneven footing into an advantage. By gauging how an opponent distributes his weight, you strike at just the right moment and in the precise spot needed to send him tumbling to the ground. While you are in this stance, you ignore penalties to speed, movement, or skill checks associated with movement (such as Tumble, Jump, and Climb checks) incurred by moving through difficult terrain. If you attack an opponent standing on difficult terrain while you are in this stance, and if that foe takes a movement penalty for moving through difficult terrain, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on Strength or Dexterity checks made as part of a bull rush or trip attempt against that enemy.

If you fail in your throw attempt, you can still move afterward. After every 10 feet you move, you can attempt another throw against the same opponent or a different foe. To make your throw attempt, you must succeed on a melee touch attack.

For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw distance and the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you, and he takes a total of 4d6 points of damage. You must place the target in an empty space.

Even under the bright desert sun, you are difficult to spot as long as you remain in motion. As an initiate of the Shadow Hand school, you learn to channel and control dark, shadowy energies. This energy flows around you like a concealing robe, hiding you from your opponents as they attempt to strike you. If you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you gain concealment against all melee and ranged attacks until the start of your next turn. You also gain the standard benefits of concealment, but you cannot use this stance to hide in plain sight; you must still use some other terrain feature that normally allows you to use the Hide skill. The fluttering shadows make it difficult to specifically target you, but your enemies are aware of your position. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.

Roll a d20 and refer to the information below to determine toward which point of his body the freezing shadow spreads. This effect functions even if your opponent is not humanoid; once you have struck your foe's heart, the shadow produces the same effects even in a creature with a different anatomy.

In this case, the shadow blade discharges its magic and imbues your attack with cold energy. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent. Unlike on a normal attack, you roll 2d20 and select which of the two die results to use. If you use the higher die result, resolve your attack as normal.

A warrior with less skill would lose his balance and fall to the ground when using this fighting style.

You can enter the space of any creature of your size category or smaller. If you enter and occupy all of the space occupied by such a creature, it takes damage equal to 2d6 + 1-1/2 times your Str bonus (if any). You can deal trampling damage to a creature only once per round, no matter how many times you move into or through its space. You must move into every square a creature occupies to trample it.

Each of your attacks is precisely timed to maximize the carnage it inflicts. You must be wielding two or more weapons to initiate this maneuver. As you hack into your opponent, you use your weapons together to murderous effect. With a cruel twist of your blade, you widen the wounds you cause with each successive strike. You must initiate this maneuver before making any attacks in the current round. If you strike an opponent multiple times during your turn, you also deal rend damage. This damage is based on the number of times you strike your opponent during your turn (see the table below). Determine the rend damage dealt immediately after you make your last attack for your turn. If you attack multiple opponents during your turn, you gain this extra damage against each of them. A creature takes rend damage based on the number of attacks that hit it, not the number of successful attacks you make.
