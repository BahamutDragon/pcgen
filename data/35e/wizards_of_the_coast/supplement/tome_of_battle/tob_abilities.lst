Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Crusader ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:As a crusader, you are proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light, medium, and heavy armor, and all shields.

Maneuvers				KEY:Crusader ~ Maneuvers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You begin your career with knowledge of five martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to you are Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, and White Raven. Once you know a maneuver, you must ready it before you can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by crusaders is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. Your maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you initiate one. You learn additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown on Table 1-1. You must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. See Table 3-1, page 39, to determine the highest-level maneuvers you can learn. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered crusader level after that (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), you can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one you already know. In effect, you lose the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. You can choose a new maneuver of any level you like, as long as you observe your restriction on the highest-level maneuvers you know; you need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. For example, upon reaching 10th level, you could trade in a single 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level maneuver for a maneuver of 5th level or lower, as long as you meet the prerequisite of the new maneuver. You can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Crusader Maneuver|CrusaderManueversKnown		SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Maneuvers Readied			KEY:Crusader ~ Maneuvers Readied			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You can ready all five maneuvers you know at 1st level, but as you advance in level and learn more maneuvers, you must choose which maneuvers to ready. You ready maneuvers by praying for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to pray again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in prayer, you can change your readied maneuvers. You begin an encounter with all your readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times you might have already used them since you chose them. When you initiate a maneuver, you expend it for the current encounter, so each of your readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless you recover them, as described below). Crusaders are unique among martial adepts, relying on f lashes of divine inspiration to use their martial maneuvers. As such, you do not control access to your readied maneuvers. Before you take your first action in an encounter, two of your readied maneuvers (randomly determined) are granted to you. The rest of your readied maneuvers are withheld, currently inaccessible. At the end of each turn, one previously withheld maneuver (again, randomly determined) is granted to you, and thus becomes accessible for your next turn and subsequent turns. You can freely choose to initiate any maneuver that is currently granted when your turn begins, but you cannot initiate a withheld maneuver. If you choose not to employ a maneuver in a given round, your currently granted maneuvers remain available, and a previously withheld maneuver is granted, as described above. In other words, it doesn't matter if you use your maneuvers or not-at the end of each of your turns, one withheld maneuver from your  selection of readied maneuvers is granted to you. Over the course of a few rounds, all your maneuvers will eventually be granted. If, at the end of your turn, you cannot be granted a maneuver because you have no withheld maneuvers remaining, you recover all expended maneuvers, and a new pair of readied maneuvers is granted to you. Randomly determine which of your maneuvers are granted and which are withheld. At the end of your next turn, a withheld maneuver is granted to you, and the whole process of divine inspiration begins again. You begin an encounter with an additional granted maneuver at 10th level (bringing your total to three), and again at 20th level (bringing your total to four).																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Stances Known			KEY:Crusader ~ Stances Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You begin play with knowledge of one 1st-level stance from the Devoted Spirit, Stone Dragon, or White Raven discipline. At 2nd, 8th, and 14th level, you can choose an additional stance. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you currently use as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. Unlike with maneuvers, you cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one you already know.

Steely Resolve			KEY:Crusader ~ Steely Resolve				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:SteelyResolveBonus|0	DESC:Your supreme dedication and intense focus allow you to temporarily set aside the pain and hindering effects of injuries. When an opponent strikes you, the injury does not immediately affect you. You have a delayed damage pool that allows you to forestall the effects of many injuries. This pool begins at 0 with each encounter. When you are attacked, any hit point damage the blow deals is added to your delayed damage pool. At the end of your next turn, you take damage equal to the total stored in your delayed damage pool, which then resets to 0. Any healing you receive can either increase your current hit point total as normal or reduce the total damage in your delayed damage pool. When you receive healing, you choose whether it affects your damage pool, your hit points, or both (you can split the amount of healing as you wish). Most crusaders opt to keep as much damage in their delayed damage pool as possible to maximize the benefit of their furious counterstrike ability (see below). Special effects tied to an attack, such as energy drain, stun, and so forth, still affect you as normal, and their effects are not delayed by this ability. For example, if you are bitten by a venomous spider, you must still attempt a Fortitude save against the poison immediately, even though the bite damage shifts into your delayed damage pool. By the same token, any other special attack that imposes a condition, such as a medusa's petrifying gaze, takes immediate effect on you. At 1st level, your delayed damage pool can hold up to 5 points of damage. Any damage beyond that comes off your hit points as normal. The maximum damage your pool holds increases by 5 at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.

Furious Counterstrike		KEY:Crusader ~ Furious Counterstrike		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:You can channel the pain of your injuries into a boiling rage that lets you lash out at your enemies with renewed vigor and power. Each attack that strikes you only pushes you onward to greater glory. During your turn, you gain a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the current value of your delayed damage pool (see steely resolve, above) divided by 5, and rounding down (minimum +1). You can only gain a maximum bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls of +6 from furious counterstrike. Use the table below to quickly determine the attack bonus and damage bonus from furious counterstrike, based on the amount of damage in your delayed damage pool. This ability's benefits last until the end of your turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Indomitable Soul			KEY:Crusader ~ Indomitable Soul			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you draw upon the power of your unwavering faith to steel yourself against the enemies you face. Your personality, energy, and dedication to your faith make it possible for you to shrug off attacks that target your willpower. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) as a bonus on Will saves. This bonus does not stack with that from a paladin's divine grace ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Zealous Surge			KEY:Crusader ~ Zealous Surge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:Your boundless energy and dedication to your cause allow you to throw off the effect of a special attack, spell, or other attack that would otherwise hinder or harm you. Once per day, from 3rd level on, you can opt to reroll a single saving throw. You must abide by the result of the new, second saving throw, even if it is lower than the first. This ability does not require an action. You simply decide to use it after seeing the result of your saving throw roll but before the DM tells you if it fails or succeeds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Smite					KEY:Crusader ~ Smite					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:SmiteTimes|0		DESC:Driven by the courage of your convictions and the ironclad strength of your beliefs, you can strike back at those who dare stand against your cause. Starting at 6th level, once per day, you can concentrate all your anger, hatred, and determination into a single attack. On the next melee attack you make, you gain a bonus on your attack roll equal to your Charisma bonus (if any) and a bonus on damage equal to your crusader level. At 18th level, you gain an additional use of smite per day.

Die Hard				KEY:Crusader ~ Die Hard					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:At 10th level, you gain Die Hard as a bonus feat.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.11
Mettle				KEY:Crusader ~ Mettle					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Crusader Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:You can resist magical attacks with greater effectiveness than other warriors. Beginning at 13th level, by drawing on your boundless energy and dedication to your cause, you can shrug off effects that would hinder even the toughest warrior. If you succeed on a Fortitude or Will save against an attack that would normally produce a lesser effect on a successful save (such as a spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), you instead negate the effect. You do not gain the benefit of mettle when you are unconscious or sleeping.

# Swordsage
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Swordsage ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:As a swordsage, you are proficient with simple weapons, martial melee weapons (including those that can be used as thrown weapons), and light armor, but not with shields.

Maneuvers				KEY:Swordsage ~ Maneuvers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You begin your career with knowledge of six martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to you are Desert Wind, Diamond Mind, Setting Sun, Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon, and Tiger Claw. Once you know a maneuver, you must ready it before you can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by swordsages is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. Your maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you initiate one. You learn additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown on Table 1-2. You must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. See Table 3-1, page 39, to determine the highest-level maneuvers you can learn. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered swordsage level after that (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), you can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one you already know. In effect, you lose the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. You can choose a new maneuver of any level you like, as long as you observe your restriction on the highest- level maneuvers you know; you need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. For example, upon reaching 10th level, you could trade in a single 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level maneuver for a maneuver of 5th level or lower, as long as you meet the prerequisite of the new maneuver. You can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.

Maneuvers Readied			KEY:Swordsage ~ Maneuvers Readied			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You can ready four of your six maneuvers known at 1st level, and as you advance in level and learn more maneuvers, you are able to ready more, but you must still choose which maneuvers to ready. You ready your maneuvers by meditating and exercising for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to meditate again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in meditation, you can change your readied maneuvers. You begin an encounter with all your readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times you might have already used them since you chose them. When you initiate a maneuver, you expend it for the current encounter, so each of your readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless you recover them, as described below). You can recover an expended maneuver by using a fullround action to quickly meditate. Doing this does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you complete your meditation, you can choose one expended maneuver to refresh. It is now available for use in a subsequent round.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Stances Known			KEY:Swordsage ~ Stances Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You begin play with knowledge of one 1st-level stance from any discipline open to you. At 2nd, 5th, 9th, 14th, and 20th level, you can choose additional stances. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you currently use as a swift action.

This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you are flat-footed. However, you lose this bonus when you are immobilized or helpless.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Discipline Focus			KEY:Swordsage ~ Discipline Focus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:As a swordsage, you can focus your training to take advantage of each discipline's fighting style. Each time you gain the discipline focus ability, select one of the six swordsage disciplines to which that focus applies. You can select a different discipline each time you gain discipline focus, but you must know at least one martial maneuver from the selected discipline. Even if you select a different discipline at higher levels, your discipline choice for earlier abilities does not change. This focus manifests in the following ways.	DESC:&nl;Weapon Focus: At 1st level, you gain the benefit of the Weapon Focus feat for weapons associated with the chosen discipline. See the discipline descriptions in Chapter 4.	DESC:&nl;Insightful Strikes: At 4th level, you can add your Wisdom modifier as a bonus on damage rolls whenever you execute a strike from the chosen discipline. At 12th level, you can choose a second discipline to which this ability applies.	DESC:&nl;Defensive Stance: At 8th level, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws whenever you adopt a stance from the chosen discipline. At 16th level, you can choose a second discipline to which this ability applies. You gain a +2 bonus on Martial Lore checks made regarding a maneuver in a discipline in which you have discipline focus.

Sense Magic				KEY:Swordsage ~ Sense Magic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:Beginning at 7th level, you can spend 10 minutes focusing upon a weapon or suit of armor. If you succeed on a level check (DC 10 + the caster level of the weapon or armor), you can identify the properties of that item, including its enhancement bonus and special abilities. This ability does not reveal the properties of artifacts or legacy weapons, though it does indicate that such items are significantly powerful.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Evasion				KEY:Swordsage ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:At 9th level, you can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.17
Improved Evasion			KEY:Swordsage ~ Improved Evasion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Swordsage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:From 17th level on, you gain the benefit of improved evasion. You still take no damage if you make a successful Reflex save against an attack, and even if you fail the Reflex save, you take only half damage from the attack.

Maneuvers				KEY:Warblade ~ Maneuvers				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You begin your career with knowledge of three martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to you are Diamond Mind, Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, Tiger Claw, and White Raven. Once you know a maneuver, you must ready it before you can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by warblades is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in its description. Your maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you initiate one. You learn additional maneuvers at higher levels, as shown on Table 1-3. You must meet a maneuver's prerequisite to learn it. See Table 3-1, page 39, to determine the highest-level maneuvers you can learn. Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered warblade level after that (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), you can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one you already know. In effect, you lose the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. You can choose a new maneuver of any level you like, as long as you observe your restriction on the highest-level maneuvers you know; you need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. For example, upon reaching 10th level, you could trade in a single 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level maneuver for a maneuver of 5th level or lower, as long as you meet the prerequisite of the new maneuver. You can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.																																																																																																																																																																																																												BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Warblade Maneuver|WarbladeManueversKnown		SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Maneuvers Readied			KEY:Warblade ~ Maneuvers Readied			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You can ready all three of the maneuvers you know at 1st level, but as you advance in level and learn more maneuvers, you must choose which maneuvers to ready. You ready your maneuvers by exercising for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to exercise again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in practice, you can change your readied maneuvers. You begin an encounter with all your readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times you might have already used them since you chose them. When you initiate a maneuver, you expend it for the current encounter, so each of your readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (until you recover them, as described below). You can recover all expended maneuvers with a single swift action, which must be immediately followed in the same round with a melee attack or using a standard action to do nothing else in the round (such as executing a quick, harmless flourish with your weapon). You cannot initiate a maneuver or change your stance while you are recovering your expended maneuvers, but you can remain in a stance in which you began your turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.21
Stances Known			KEY:Warblade ~ Stances Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You begin play with knowledge of one 1st level stance from any discipline open to warblades. At 4th, 10th, and 16th level, you can choose additional stances. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you are currently using as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. Unlike with maneuvers, you cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one you already know.

Battle Clarity			KEY:Warblade ~ Battle Clarity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:You can enter a state of almost mystical awareness of the battlefield around you. As long as you are not flat-footed, you gain an insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (maximum equals your warblade level) on your Reflex saves.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Weapon Aptitude			KEY:Warblade ~ Weapon Aptitude			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warblade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:Your training with a wide range of weaponry and tactics gives you great skill with particular weapons. You qualify for feats that usually require a minimum number of fighter levels (such as Weapon Specialization) as if you had a fighter level equal to your warblade level -2. For example, as a 6th-level warblade, you could take Weapon Specialization, since you're treated as being a 4th-level fighter for this purpose. These effective fighter levels stack with any actual fighter levels you have. Thus, a fighter 2/warblade 4 would also qualify for Weapon Specialization. You also have the flexibility to adjust your weapon training. Each morning, you can spend 1 hour in weapon practice to change the designated weapon for any feat you have that applies only to a single weapon (such as Weapon Focus). You must have the newly designated weapon available during your practice session to make this change. For example, if you wish to change the designated weapon for your Weapon Focus feat from greatsword to longsword, you must have a longsword available to practice with during your practice session. You can adjust any number of your feats in this way, and you don't have to adjust them all in the same way. However, you can't change the weapon choices in such a way that you no longer meet the prerequisite for some other feat you possess. For instance, if you have both Weapon Focus (longsword) and Weapon Specialization (longsword), you can't change the designated weapon for Weapon Focus unless you also change the weapon for Weapon Specialization in the same way.

You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if you are caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if you are immobilized. If you already have uncanny dodge from a different class (barbarian or rogue, for example), you automatically gain improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

So long as the potential for victory exists, you fight on. Death has little meaning to you in light of the cause you fight for. So long as the mission stands before you uncompleted, or a battle remains in doubt, you fight on. Stories abound of crusaders who, while in the grips of this stance, fought for days on end to hold a mountain pass against orcs, trolls, and other fiends. So long as you remain in this stance, you cannot be killed or incapacitated by effects or attacks that reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points. If you take such damage, you can make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to your negative hit point total. If you fail this save, you die or fall unconscious (as appropriate). If this save is successful, you are still alive and conscious, with 1 hit point remaining. This stance provides no protection against effects that slay you without dealing hit point damage, or other effects that petrify, paralyze, and so forth. You can still be slain by a coup de grace if a spell or effect renders you helpless. After you attempt three saving throws to avoid death or unconsciousness, this stance automatically ends.

When your foe strikes, you duck out of the way. As she follows through with her attack, she inadvertently attacks an ally. You gain this stance's benefit when an opponent's attack against you has a miss chance, such as from concealment. Whenever an opponent's melee or ranged attack misses you because of this miss chance, you can choose to change the target of the attack from you to another eligible target (other than your attacker).

As you make your attack, both your true weapon and the illusion slash at your foe. This maneuver allows you to create a mystical double of your weapon. As you attack, your foe must decide which weapon to defend against. In most cases, the illusory weapon distracts your foe and allows your true attack to hit. In some cases, both attacks strike home. In this case, the shadow blade discharges its magic and imbues your attack with cold energy. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent. Unlike on a normal attack, you roll 2d20 and select which of the two die results to use. If you use the higher die result, resolve your attack as normal. (Your mystic double misses, but your true attack might hit.) If you use the lower die result, or if both die results are the same, your attack deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage as both the mystic double's attack and your true weapon strike home.

After a few short, barked orders from you, your allies switch positions and assume a tactically advantageous position. When you initiate this maneuver, all allies within 30 feet of you can immediately take a single move action to move up to their speed.

Combining this shout with a canny attack, you strip away a foe's defenses, allowing your allies to make potentially devastating attacks. As part of this maneuver, you make a single melee attack against an opponent.

Fired by your commanding presence and deftly led by your supreme grasp of tactics, you and your allies form an unstoppable wedge. You are an inspiring figure on the battlefield, allowing you to lead others on attacks that would strike fear and doubt into even the stoutest warrior's heart. Under your leadership, the group becomes much more than the sum of its parts. As part of this maneuver, you charge an opponent. In addition, all allies within 30 feet of you at the beginning of your turn can also charge this target as an immediate action. You and allied creatures do not block each other when determining if you can charge. Your charge attack deals an extra 50 points of damage, and those of your allies each deal an extra 25 points of damage.

Her initiative count immediately equals your initiative count -1. She then acts on her new initiative count as normal. If she has already acted in the current round, she can act again. If this maneuver would not change your ally's initiative count, it has no effect. If she has not yet acted during this round, her initiative count changes, and she acts on that count as normal.

While shifting, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength and you grow claws that can be used as natural weapons. These claws deal 1d4 points of damage with each successful attack. You can attack with one claw as a standard action or with two claws as a full attack action (as a primary natural weapon). You cannot attack more than once per round with a single claw, even if your base attack bonus is high enough to give you multiple attacks. You can attack with a claw as a light off-hand weapon while wielding a weapon in your primary hand, but doing so incurs the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons. Shifting is a free action and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Con modifier + your bloodclaw master class level.

Weapon Aptitude			KEY:Bloodstorm Blade ~ Weapon Aptitude			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Bloodstorm Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Your training with a wide range of weaponry and tactics allows you the opportunity to gain great skill with particular weapons. You can qualify for feats requiring a minimum number of fighter levels (such as Weapon Specialization) as if you had a fighter level equal to your combined warblade and bloodstorm blade levels -2. Furthermore, you have the flexibility to adjust your weapon training. Each morning, you can spend 1 hour practicing and change the weapons selected for any feat you have that applies only to a single chosen weapon. For example, you could change your Weapon Focus (greataxe) feat so its benefit applies to longswords instead. You can adjust any number of your feats in this way, and you don't have to adjust them all in the same way. You can't change the weapon choices in such a way that you no longer meet a feat's prerequisite. For instance, you must be proficient with a weapon chosen for Weapon Focus; and if you have both Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization with the longsword, you couldn't change Weapon Focus without also changing Weapon Specialization to the same weapon. You must also have that weapon available during practice; if you don't have a longsword handy, you can't assign your feats to affect longswords.

Thunderous Throw			KEY:Bloodstorm Blade ~ Thunderous Throw			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Bloodstorm Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you build up incredible tension as you ready yourself to throw your weapon, which becomes visible around you like heat waves. When you release your weapon, that power rushes out with your weapon. As a swift action, you can choose to treat your ranged attack rolls with thrown weapons as melee attacks for the rest of your turn. You use your melee attack bonus, including Strength bonus, feats, and so forth, to determine your attack bonus for each attack as normal, but you apply the standard modifiers for range penalties. Attacking into melee, through cover, and so forth incurs the standard penalties. In addition, you can apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage if you wield the thrown weapon with two hands, and you can use Power Attack with your thrown weapon attacks (adding two times the number subtracted from attack rolls as a bonus on damage rolls when throwing a twohanded weapon).

SOURCEPAGE:p.101
Blood Wind Ricochet		KEY:Bloodstorm Blade ~ Blood Wind Ricochet		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Bloodstorm Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:As a full-round action, at 5th level and higher, you can hurl a weapon at a foe and compel it to ricochet to other enemies before hurtling back to your waiting hand. The weapon you throw behaves as though it has the returning special ability (DMG 225), except that you determine the point during your turn when the weapon returns to you. When using this ability, you make a full attack with a thrown weapon, but each ranged attack must be resolved against a separate target. You can choose the order in which you attack your foes. Range and cover penalties are resolved for each attack after the first as though that attack originated from the space of the creature you last attacked. If a creature has total cover relative to you, you cannot attack it. When you use blood wind ricochet, you lose the use of one Iron Heart strike you have readied for the current encounter, just as if you had initiated the strike (except you do not also gain the strike's normal effect). Once you use this ability, you can recover the maneuver you expended and use it normally.

While you are in an Iron Heart stance, you can forgo its normal benefit as a swift action to gain the effect of eye of the storm. This ability lasts as long as you would maintain the Iron Heart stance, or as described below. You can also stop using eye of the storm and resume gaining the normal benefit of the stance as a swift action. When you use this ability, you gain a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks and a +2 competence bonus on Reflex saves. In addition, when a foe makes an attack of opportunity against you when you make a ranged attack while threatened, you can make a single melee attack against that foe as a swift action (assuming you're not unarmed and you threaten the foe). Such an attack does not count as an attack of opportunity. To retain this defensive posture, you can move no more than 10 feet on your turn.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.102
Blood Rain				KEY:Bloodstorm Blade ~ Blood Rain				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Bloodstorm Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:Beginning at 8th level, you can enter a state that enables you to inflict a terrible bleeding wound on any living creature you damage with a thrown weapon or a melee attack. While you are in an Iron Heart stance, you can forgo its normal benefit as a swift action to gain the effect of blood rain. This ability lasts as long as you would maintain the Iron Heart stance, or as described below. You can also stop using blood rain and resume gaining the normal benefit of the stance as a swift action. The creature you hit with your attack takes 3 points of damage due to blood loss at the beginning of your turn each round. This effect ends if you stop using the stance. An affected creature can end the effect by being the beneficiary of any healing (such as a cure spell) or a DC 15 Heal check. The bleeding effect of blood rain does not stack with itself or the blood rain ability of another bloodstorm blade.

Blade Storm				KEY:Bloodstorm Blade ~ Blade Storm				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Bloodstorm Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary							DESC:At 10th level, you can hurl your weapon as a full-round action to make it seem as if you are attacking a dozen foes at once. You become the center of a storm of steel as your thrown weapon flies out to strike a foe, returns to ricochet harmlessly off you, then flies out to attack another foe. You can make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon at your highest attack bonus against as many targets as you wish. You can attack each target just once with this attack, calculating range and cover penalties from your position on the battlefield. When you use blade storm, you lose the use of one Iron Heart strike you have readied for the current encounter, just as if you had initiated the strike (except you do not also gain the strike's normal effect). Once you use this ability, you can recover the maneuver you expended and use it normally.

Mountain Fortress Stance	KEY:Deepstone Sentinel ~ Mountain Fortress Stance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Deepstone Sentinel Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:As a novice deepstone sentinel, you learn to make yourself as impenetrable as a mountain fortress. This ability is a key component of this prestige class's combat abilities. While you are in a Stone Dragon stance, you can forgo its normal benefit as a swift action to gain the effect of mountain fortress stance. This ability lasts as long as you would maintain the Stone Dragon stance, or as described below. You can also stop using mountain fortress stance and resume gaining the normal benefit of the stance as a swift action. When you use this ability, you can choose to create a fortress of earth or rock, provided you are standing on earth, stone, rock, or a worked surface such as a cobblestone street or a flagstone floor (as long as natural earth or rock is no more than 1 foot below you). The square (or squares) that you occupy forms a pillar of earth or rock 5 feet tall, with you on top. Each square adjacent to you is buckled and steeply sloped, becoming difficult terrain. Any creature that attempts to enter or leave one of these squares must make a DC 10 Balance check or fall prone in the last square of the area it occupied. Creatures that ignore difficult terrain automatically succeed on this check, and flying creatures are unaffected. Creatures with four or more legs or the stability racial trait gain a +4 bonus on this Balance check. You retain the benefit of mountain fortress stance until you end your Stone Dragon stance or move more than 5 feet in a round. You are unaffected by the difficult terrain you create with this ability. If you move only 5 feet in a round, the pillar of earth you have created moves with you, creating new squares of difficult terrain in every square adjacent to your new position. If creatures occupy those newly adjacent squares, they do not need to immediately make Balance checks as described above. However, if on their turn they attempt to leave the area of difficult terrain, they are affected by mountain fortress stance as normal, and squares that are no longer adjacent to you return to their natural state. If you move more than 5 feet in a round while using mountain fortress stance, the effect ends, and the ground immediately returns to normal.

When you do so, the hill you created with mountain fortress stance suddenly sinks, sending any foes standing in squares adjacent to you crashing to the ground. In addition, you tumble down the crumbling hill like a living avalanche. When you use this ability, all creatures within the area of difficult terrain created by your mountain fortress stance must make DC 15 Balance checks or fall prone. The bonus for stability or having extra legs does not apply. In addition, you can use a charge to attack an enemy as part of this ability's activation. If your attack is successful, it deals an extra 2d6 points of damage owing to the momentum you gain as you hurtle down your temporary hill and slam into your opponent. You cannot activate mountain fortress stance on the same turn in which you use this ability.

The creature's speed for all movement modes except flight drops to 0 feet. A creature's fly speed remains unchanged.

The pillar occupies one square and is 5 or 10 feet tall (your choice). You can call forth a stone pillar only from natural, unworked earth or stone. A creature standing in the square must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or be knocked prone.

Once per encounter as a swift action, you cause the ground around you to shudder and churn as if rocked by an earthquake. All enemies within a 60-foot radius must make successful Reflex saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or take 12d6 points of damage and fall prone. A successful save allows an opponent to take half damage and remain standing. Improved stability (such as a dwarf's racial ability) does not help a creature avoid being knocked prone by this ability.

The blade guide is incorporeal, has hit points equal to your own, and is size Fine. Its AC is 18, and it can fly with perfect maneuverability and a speed of 30 feet. If your blade guide is destroyed, or it somehow moves out of your line of effect, it reappears in your space in 1d6 rounds. The guide is the physical manifestation of a spirit that resides on the Outer Planes. Destroying a blade guide's form merely severs its link to the Material Plane for a short time. A blade guide appears as a mote of white energy. It uses your senses to see and hear, and communicates with you by telepathy. Thus, it cannot interact with objects and creatures that you cannot see. Your blade guide is meant to aid you in combat, not serve as a scout. Sometimes, your guide appears as a ghostly image of how it looked in life. This manifestation requires tremendous effort, and your guide chooses to attempt it only when it must communicate with others under dire circumstances. When a blade guide manifests, it can speak with others as normal. A blade guide can appear in this manner for up to 10 minutes per day. While it manifests, you lose access to your blade guide and any class abilities that require it to function. If a blade guide must make a saving throw, it uses your save modifier. It lacks skill ranks, feats, Hit Dice, and ability score modifiers.

Each night when you enter trance, your blade guide enters your mind. In your dreams, the two of you spar and practice across a hundred different battlefields. You fight ogres, trolls, and other monsters that your guide creates from the ether of dreams. You practice maneuvers beyond your normal capacity. With each night that passes, you become more and more skilled in the fighting arts. Once per day, you can draw upon this nightly training to aid you in a single battle. You can choose one of two benefits. Each of these benefits lasts for one encounter. You gain an insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (if any) on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures of a single type. If you select humanoid or outsider as the type, you must also choose a subtype. Alternatively, you can gain the use of one maneuver from the Diamond Mind or Devoted Spirit discipline. You must meet the prerequisite for this maneuver as normal. A crusader/ eternal guardian who selects this option is immediately granted this maneuver. A maneuver gained with eternal training can be recovered with your normal recovery method (if you have one) during the encounter, but knowledge of the maneuver fades immediately after the encounter ends. You gain an additional use per day of this ability at 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level. Even if you have multiple uses of this ability per day, you can use this ability only once per encounter.

Defensive Insight			KEY:Eternal Blade ~ Defensive Insight			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Eternal Blade Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:Your blade guide's advice and insights grant you an intellectual edge in combat, but there is a fine line between knowing how to do something and executing it in combat.

In almost any situation you face, you have the experience, tactical lore, and knowledge needed to defeat your enemy. From 8th level on, as a swift action, you can assess a tactical situation and make an attack that improves the attacks of your allies. For the rest of your turn, any opponent you hit with a melee attack takes a penalty to AC equal to your Intelligence bonus (if any) for 1 round. This penalty applies only to attacks made by your allies.

If you have no monk levels, you gain the AC bonus of a monk whose level equals your Shadow Sun ninja level. In addition, you gain additional uses of the Stunning Fist feat as a monk. (Your non-monk, non-Shadow Sun ninja class levels provide one use per four levels and your monk, and Shadow Sun ninja class levels provide one use per level.) You do not count your class levels for the purpose of determining when you gain any other monk class features, such as bonus feats, evasion, or other special abilities.

Touch of the Shadow Sun		KEY:Shadow Sun Ninja ~ Touch of the Shadow Sun		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Sun Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A Shadow Sun ninja strikes a careful balance between light and dark, good and evil. Although your heart is dedicated to good, you know that the shadow of evil will always be a part of you. This realization, along with careful control of your ki energy, allows you to wield the energy of both the dark and light aspects of your being. This understanding and mastery allows you to deal damage with one attack, then turn and heal an ally with the reverse of that harmful energy. With a melee touch attack made as a standard action, you can deal negative energy damage equal to your base unarmed damage + your Wis modifier. Note that undead are healed by this attack, since it uses negative energy. In the round after you use this ability, you can touch a creature as a standard action and heal an amount of damage equal to the damage you dealt with your negative energy touch on the previous round. If the target of this healing touch makes no effort to prevent you from touching him, you can touch the creature as a swift action. You cannot use both aspects of this ability on the same round, nor can you use the negative energy touch again in a round after you have already successfully used it. After you channel negative energy into a creature, you convert that energy into a positive energy charge that prevents you from using the negative energy aspect of this ability until the positive energy has been discharged.

Flame of the Shadow Sun		KEY:Shadow Sun Ninja ~ Flame of the Shadow Sun		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Sun Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, you can create a protective cloak of negative energy by using your ki. This cloak absorbs cold damage. You can then gather this energy, transform it, and unleash it as a searing attack. As an immediate action, you can shroud yourself in shimmering, dark energy that provides resistance to cold 10 until the start of your next turn. If this resistance reduces the damage you take from any attack or effect, you can take a swift action on your next turn to hurl a bolt of fiery energy with a range of 60 feet. This bolt requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 2d6 points of fire damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Light within Darkness		KEY:Shadow Sun Ninja ~ Light within Darkness		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Sun Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:From 4th level on, the darkness cannot muffle your inner light. Rather, the shadows cause it to seethe and roil as the light within you struggles to break free. If you make a melee attack against an opponent on the round after you make a successful Hide check, you burst into a searing corona of light. All opponents within 60 feet of you that failed to detect you while you were hiding must make Fortitude saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or be blinded for 1 round. Creatures who are aware of the ninja, such as those who made successful Spot checks to notice her, are unaffected by this attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Darkness within Light		KEY:Shadow Sun Ninja ~ Darkness within Light		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Sun Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You know that while light cannot exist without darkness, the opposite is also true. By focusing your ki and closing your eyes, you view the world in a vague, shadowy form. Those also trapped within darkness appear clear and distinct before you. Starting at 5th level, you can close your eyes and willfully ignore any other senses that confer the ability to pinpoint the location of a creature (such as blindsense, blindsight, and scent). You become effectively blinded, but you gain a special benefit on attacks made against targets that are also blinded or effectively blinded. Against such foes, you ignore the drawbacks for fighting while blinded. Instead, you gain a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls and a +4 bonus on melee damage rolls against such enemies. In addition, if you have the Stunning Fist feat, blinded opponents take a -2 penalty on their saves to resist your stunning attacks. You suffer the penalties for being blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn. The blindness cannot be negated through any means, magical or mundane, until that time. You gain the benefit of this ability if you willingly turn off your sense of sight or if some effect, such as a blindness spell, robs you of your sight.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Void of the Shadow Sun		KEY:Shadow Sun Ninja ~ Void of the Shadow Sun		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Sun Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:You eventually learn to draw upon the power of light to shield you from attacks. Even if an opponent manages to breach this shield, it is not destroyed. Rather than fade away, the shield shifts into an aura of icy cold, black energy that can harm your enemies. Starting at 7th level, as a swift action you can wreath yourself in a halo of bright, flaming light. You gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC. This ability lasts until the start of your next turn. If an opponent successfully hits you despite your improved AC, you lose the deflection bonus to AC and you cannot use this ability again on your next turn. However, you can project a pulse of frigid, black energy in a 30-foot-radius burst around you as a standard action in the round after your shield is pierced. Enemies in this area take 8d6 points of cold damage, with a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) for half damage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Child of Shadow and Light	KEY:Shadow Sun Ninja ~ Child of Shadow and Light	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Sun Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:As you learn to harness the power of your ki, you become capable of spilling forth light and dark energy. Beginning at 8th level, you can focus your power, engulfing the area around you in alternating patterns of light and dark. While you are in a Setting Sun or Shadow Hand stance, you can forgo its normal benefit as a swift action to gain the effect of child of shadow and light. This ability lasts as long as you would maintain the Setting Sun or Shadow Hand stance, or as described below. You can also stop using child of shadow and light and resume gaining the normal benefit of the stance as a swift action. If you use this ability to exert light energy, the area around you fills with blinding light. All enemies within a 60-footradius burst become dazzled (DMG 300) for 1 round. This is a 9th-level spell for purposes of determining how it interacts with magical darkness. If you exert dark energy, the area around you is cast into total darkness for 1 round in a 60-foot-radius burst. This ability is considered a 9th-level spell for the purpose of determining how it interacts with magical light. As long as you maintain this stance, you alternate between projecting light and darkness. If this ability is active at the beginning of your turn, its effects reverse. If it projects light, it now projects darkness, and vice versa. You cannot activate this ability in the same round in which you end its effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.127
Balance of Light and Dark	KEY:Shadow Sun Ninja ~ Balance of Light and Dark	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Shadow Sun Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:As a Shadow Sun ninja, you strive to control your dark side, even as you use it to power your martial arts. Sometimes, particularly when you face a truly daunting foe, you can allow your inner shadow to run rampant. In such cases, you undergo a terrible transformation. When you adopt this wrathful battle aspect, your foes are doomed. Yet, each time you use this ability, you teeter closer to damnation. At 10th level, once per day as a swift action, you can transform into a creature of pure darkness for 1 minute. Your body and all items you carry when you transform become a deep, inky black. You gain immunity to critical hits, mind-affecting abilities, death attacks, energy drain, and poison. You also gain a +8 bonus on Hide checks. Negative energy attacks, such as inf lict spells, heal rather than harm you. You gain a +4 bonus on attacks against creatures in areas of darkness or shadowy illumination. In addition to these benefits, with each successful unarmed attack you make, you can choose to bestow one negative level on your opponent. You heal 5 points of damage for each negative level you bestow. These negative levels disappear in 1 hour. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as HD, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from her highest available level. Negative levels stack. At the end of your transformation, you take 1 point of Constitution damage per negative level you bestowed. If this damage drops your Constitution to 0 or lower, your body dissipates into an inky cloud. Unless you are restored to life by true resurrection, you rise in 1d4 days as a vampire. Your alignment becomes evil, though your alignment on the law-chaos axis remains the same. You are now a dedicated champion of evil and an NPC. You retain access to all your abilities in this prestige class and lack a normal vampire's vulnerability to sunlight. Your vampiric body forms in the spot where your mortal form perished. Legend holds that the souls of Shadow Sun ninjas who are corrupted in this manner are imprisoned within the Iron City of Dis, Dispater's capital within the depths of Hell. A successful quest to free the soul from its prison cell destroys the vampire and restores the Shadow Sun ninja to life. Legend holds that several mighty Shadow Sun heroes languish within Dispater's prison, waiting to be freed.											SOURCEPAGE:p.128
