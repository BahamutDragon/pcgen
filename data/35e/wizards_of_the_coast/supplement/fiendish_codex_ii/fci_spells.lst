###Block - Full Description			|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Denounce.MOD					DESC:You point your finger and pronounce judgment. You instill feelings of shame and guilt in a target outsider, imposing a -4 insight penalty on its attack rolls, saves, and checks. Each round on its turn, the subject can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.) Outsiders with the good subtype are immune to denounce.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Devil's Ego.MOD					DESC:You intone profane words of prayer and run your fingers across your face. As they pass, your features soften, becoming attractive and appealing. You feel a powerful confidence building inside you. You gain a +4 profane bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. If you have levels in a noncleric spellcasting class that relies on Charisma, this spell does not grant additional bonus spells, though it could increase the save DCs for spells you cast from that class. In addition, for the duration of this spell, your type changes to outsider, making you immune to spells and effects that specifically target humanoids, such as charm person and hold person.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Devil's Eye.MOD					DESC:With a few words and a gesture, the darkness melts away, and you can see with perfect clarity. You gain the visual acuity of a devil. You can see in darkness and magical darkness out to 30 feet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hellfire.MOD					DESC:Calling upon the raw energies of Baator, you cause hellish fires to fill an area you designate. You create a small explosion of brimstone and fire. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to creatures in the affected area. The damage is not fire damage, and is not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield), and similar magic.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hellfire Storm.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like hellfire, except it deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8) to creatures in the affected area.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Amnizu.MOD			DESC:With a flash of red light and a sound like the screams of a thousand suffering souls, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from an amnizu to power the spell. You infuse a target with the intellect-sapping power and slippery mind of an amnizu. While under the effect of this spell, the target can, each round as a standard action, make a single melee touch attack. A touched creature takes 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. The subject of this spell can use this touch attack once per two caster levels. The subject of this spell also becomes immune to any effect that would damage, drain, or otherwise reduce its own Intelligence score. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the amnizu). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Barbed Devil.MOD		DESC:With brisk arcane gestures that glow with a fiery red light, you imbue a target with the might of a barbed devil, causing long thorns to sprout all over its body. You cause the target of this spell to grow a number of long barbs similar to those found on a barbed devil. While under the effect of the spell, the target does not provoke attacks of opportunity when initiating a grapple. If the subject already has improved grab or the Improved Grapple feat, it instead gains a +4 profane bonus on grapple checks. Whenever the subject successfully makes a grapple check to grab a foe, pin a foe, or deal damage, it impales its foe on its barbs, dealing extra damage based on its size. Size Damage Tiny or smaller 1d8 Small 2d8 Medium 3d8 Large 4d8 Huge 5d8 Gargantuan 6d8 Colossal 7d8 The subject also gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the barbed devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Bearded Devil.MOD	DESC:With a rush of sinister green light, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from a bearded devil to fuel the spell. You cause the target to grow a long, ropy mass of callused tissue from its chin that vaguely resembles a beard. This beard flails about as though it were alive. If the subject successfully hits an adjacent opponent with at least one melee attack in a round, it also automatically hits with its beard, dealing an extra 2d8 points of damage. The subject also gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the bearded devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the target of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Chain Devil.MOD		DESC:With a rush of red light and the faint clanking of many chains, you invest the target with the power of a chain devil. While under the effect of this spell, the target is infused with the magical energies and malignant will of a chain devil. While the spell is in effect, the subject's reach increases by 5 feet, and the subject's maximum number of attacks of opportunity made each round increases by one. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the chain devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Erinyes.MOD		DESC:With the sound of flapping wings, you grant the target the power of an erinyes. The target gains the sinister allure of an erinyes. While the spell is in effect, the subject can beckon a creature it can see clearly, forcing it to approach unless the creature succeeds on a Will save against the spell's save DC. On a failed save, the creature can do nothing on its next action except to attempt to move closer to the subject of investiture of the erinyes. The beckoned creature will not take obviously suicidal actions, such as walking off the edge of a cliff. However, it will move normally through squares threatened by other creatures. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Once the beckoned creature enters an adjacent square, or if it was already in an adjacent square, it takes no further action that round. The subject of this spell can use this effect once per three caster levels. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the erinyes). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Harvester Devil.MOD	DESC:A deep chuckle sounds as you complete the incantation, and motes of violet light surround the target, imbuing it with infernal energy drawn from a harvester devil. The target of this spell deals horrific, lingering wounds with its melee attacks. If it successfully strikes an opponent with a melee attack, it causes an infernal wound that deals an extra 1d6 points of damage each round until the creature dies, or until the struck creature is the recipient of a DC 20 Heal check, a cure spell, or a heal spell. A creature can be affected by the lingering damage of only one such infernal wound at a time. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the harvester devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Hellfire Engine.MOD	DESC:Upon the casting of this spell, the target's flesh transforms, assuming a dull metallic hue. Its eyes erupt with unholy flame, and when it opens its mouth, you see the fires of Hell roiling within. A creature affected by investiture of the hellfire engine gains all the benefits described under the iron body spell (PH 245), except that its flesh transforms into living cold iron. Its unarmed natural attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, the subject can breathe a 30-foot cone of hellfire that deals 8d10 points damage. This damage is not fire damage, and is not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by protection from energy (fire), fire shield (chill shield), and similar magic. All creatures in the area are entitled to a Reflex save against the spell's DC for half damage. The subject must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of this breath weapon. The subject also gains resistance to fire 20. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the chain devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Horned Devil.MOD		DESC:With a flash of red light, you invest the target with infernal energy, drawing power from a horned devil to fuel the spell. This spell infuses a creature with the terrible essence of a horned devil. Whenever the subject successfully strikes another living creature with the first melee attack that it makes in a round, the struck creature must succeed on a Will save against the spell's DC or be stunned for 1 round. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the horned devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Ice Devil.MOD		DESC:Malevolent blue light suffuses the target as the temperature nearby drops ominously. You infuse a creature with the savage brutality and cold cunning of an ice devil. While under the effect of this spell, whenever the subject hits a living creature with a melee attack, that creature must succeed on a Will save against the spell's DC or be slowed for 3 rounds. The subject also deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with each successful melee attack that it makes with a weapon or natural weapon. In addition, the subject gains resistance to cold and fire 10. The resistance to fire stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the ice devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Malebranche.MOD		DESC:A fearsome roar splits the air when you conclude the arcane words that invest the target with hellish power drawn from a malebranche. You infuse a creature with the raw power of the mighty malebranche, causing it to grow twisted horns of blackened bone from of its brow. While under the effect of this spell, the subject deals extra damage whenever it successfully hits with a charge attack, depending on its size. Size Damage Tiny or smaller - Small 1d6 Medium 2d6 Large 3d6 Huge 4d6 Gargantuan 6d6 Colossal 8d6 In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the malebranche). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Narzugon.MOD		DESC:A moan precedes the transformation that results when you imbue the target with the baleful power of a narzugon. You bind the dread essence of a narzugon to a target creature, filling it with the misery and horror that defines the devil's existence. The subject of this spell can use a baleful gaze as a standard action. The gaze affects a single creature within 20 feet. That creature must succeed on a Will save against the spell's save DC or be immobilized for 1 round as if affected by a hold monster spell. Baatezu are immune to this gaze attack. Once a creature has successfully resisted this effect, it cannot be affected by this gaze from the same creature for 24 hours. The subject also gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the narzugon). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Orthon.MOD			DESC:A dull humming noise sounds briefly, and the air crackles with the terrible power of an orthon. While under the effect of this spell, a creature is infused with the disruptive power of an orthon. As an immediate action, the subject of this spell can erect a 20-foot-radius field that disrupts teleportation spells or effects. All creatures in the area are prevented from using any spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that provides such movement, as if they were in the area of a dimensional lock spell. Each use of this field lasts 1 round. In addition, the subject of the spell gains the benefit of a sonic shield for as long as the spell remains in effect. This shield functions like the fire shield spell, except that it deals sonic damage instead of cold or fire, and the subject takes half damage from acid-based attacks. If exposed to an acid attack that allows a Reflex save for half damage, the subject takes no damage on a successful save. The subject gains resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the orthon). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Pit Fiend.MOD		DESC:The air shatters with a shriek of sorrow, and a flash of flame briefly limns the target of this spell as she receives a portion of the might of a pit fiend. You infuse a creature with the terrifying power of a pit fiend. The spell causes the subject's mouth to expand to accommodate new dripping fangs. To add to this devilish effect, a pair of red leathery wings tears free from the flesh of the subject's back, granting it a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. The subject of the spell gains these benefits regardless of his aspect choice (see below). The power granted to the subject by investiture of the pit fiend can manifest in one of three ways. At the beginning of each round, the invested creature chooses which aspect of the spell will be in place. Aspect of Tyranny: The invested creature's hands lengthen to horrific claws, and the creature gains powerful melee attacks. While the aspect of tyranny is in effect, the invested creature can attack with both its claws and wings. Each attack deals base damage of 2d6 points. The claws are treated as primary melee attacks with a natural weapon, and the wing attacks are treated as secondary attacks with a natural weapon. When making attacks with these claws and wings, the invested creature has a base attack bonus equal to its character level (or Hit Dice, if the invested creature has a level adjustment). When taking a full attack action and using only the natural weapons granted by the aspect of tyranny, the secondary attacks are made with only a -2 penalty rather than the normal -5. Because these are natural attacks, the invested creature cannot make multiple attacks because of a high base attack bonus. Aspect of Pestilence: When the invested creature chooses to manifest the aspect of pestilence, it can, as a standard action, release a cloud of disease-ridden air. Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw against the spell's DC or take 2 points of Strength damage. Aspect of Terror: When the invested creature chooses to manifest the aspect of terror, it can, as a standard action, release a powerful wave of fear. Creatures within 10 feet of the subject when it generates this effect must succeed on a Will saving throw against the spell's DC or become frightened for 2 rounds. This wave of fear is a mind-affecting fear effect. The subject gains immunity to poison and resistance to fire 20. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the pit fiend). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Spined Devil.MOD		DESC:The air stinks of sulfur and brimstone as you use the essence of a spinagon to imbue a creature with the power of Baator. You cause a creature to suddenly bristle with spines. The subject can snap its body forward to unleash a volley of up to three spines as a standard action (make a separate attack roll for each spine). The spines each deal 1d6 points of damage plus the subject's Strength modifier. This attack has a range of 60 feet with no range increment. The spines can be directed against different targets if desired, but all targets must be within 30 feet of one another. The subject can launch up to fifteen spines per casting of this spell. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the spined devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Investiture Of The Steel Devil.MOD		DESC:With the sound of low chanting, you invest the target with the power of a steel devil. While under the effect of this spell, the target is infused with the magical energy and deadly skill of a steel devil. While the spell is in effect, the target gains a +3 profane bonus on attack rolls and to Armor Class. This bonus increases by 1 for every adjacent creature that is also under the effect of an investiture of the steel devil spell. In addition, the subject gains resistance to fire 5. This resistance stacks with the resistance granted by other evil investiture spells (but not with multiple castings of investiture of the steel devil). While this spell is in effect, magic weapons with the evil outsider bane special ability have full effect against the subject of the investiture. After the spell's duration expires (or if it is dispelled or ended through some other means), the subject is fatigued for 1 minute. Material Component: A fist-sized chunk of brimstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Righteous Exile.MOD				DESC:With a word, your body gives off an explosion of divine energy, scorching the flesh of those creatures despised by good beings. All evil creatures in the area take 20d6 points of damage. In addition, evil outsiders that fail a Will saving throw (DC equal to spell's save DC - creature's HD + your caster level) are instantly transported back to their home planes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
