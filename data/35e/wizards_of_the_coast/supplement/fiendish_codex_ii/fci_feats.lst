Brand Of The Nine Hells	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:You gain an infernal brand, a symbol proclaiming you as the property of an archdevil. This brand might be a physical symbol, or it could be a strange change in your body's structure.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Lawful evil, devil.	BENEFIT:When you select this feat, choose an archdevil to whom you have sworn fealty. You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks made against denizens of that archdevil's layer, but take a -2 penalty on the same checks made against denizens of other layers. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. The brand grants an additional benefi t, depending upon the archdevil with which it is associated.	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:STRING|Bel|Dispater|Mammon|Fierna and Belial|Levistus|Glasya|Baalzebul|Mephistopheles|Asmodeus	DESC:&nl;Bel: The brand of Bel is a cold iron longsword or greatsword (your choice) that glistens with green hellfi re. This weapon deals normal damage appropriate to your size, plus an extra 1d6 points of damage against good-aligned creatures, or an extra 2d6 points of damage against demons. You are profi - cient with this weapon, even if you normally lack weapon profi ciency with the longsword or greatsword.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Bel)	DESC:&nl;Dispater: In keeping with your lord's fearful paranoia, you grow a pair of eyes in the back of your head. You cannot be fl anked, nor can you be caught fl at-footed.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Dispater)	DESC:&nl;Mammon: The brand of Mammon allows you to better play the careful game of balance necessary of all devils. When faced with mighty foes, you grovel and ask for mercy. Against weaker enemies, you show no quarter. If you attack an opponent with more HD than you, you automatically begin to project an aura of pity in a 30-foot radius around you. All creatures in this area must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifi er) or take a -2 penalty on attacks against you. They see you as weak, pathetic, and barely worth the effort of slaying. Creatures with fewer HD than you, or any creature at half its maximum hit points or less (even one with more HD than you), suffer a different effect from this aura. These creatures become shaken (Will negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifi er) as you take on a ghastly, enraged aspect in their eyes. A creature with more HD than you that is subsequently reduced to half hit points must make a new save against this version of your aura. If it fails, the creature becomes shaken but it no longer takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls described above (if it failed its save against the fi rst aura effect). This aura is a mind-affecting ability. A creature needs to save against each version of the aura only once every 24 hours. The aura's effect last as long as a creature is within its area.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Mammon)	DESC:&nl;Fierna and Belial: The brand of Fierna and Belial consumes you, infesting your thoughts with sinister urges. Once per round, you can use a melee touch attack to bestow these dark impulses on another creature. The target of this ability must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifi er). If it fails this save, the target is dazed for 1 round, lost in starry dreams of endless treasure, arcane might, and wishes fulfi lled. You can use this mind-affecting ability once every 1d4 rounds.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Fierna and Belial)	DESC:&nl;Levistus: The brand of Levistus grants you a mystical link to that trapped archdevil's prison. Once per day as a swift action, you become encased in armor of ice. You gain resistance to cold 20, and all of your natural attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of cold damage. This benefi t lasts for 10 minutes.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Levistus)	DESC:&nl;Glasya: The brand of Glasya fi lls you with power, drawn from the shuddering remains of the Hag Countess. Once per day, you can activate this ability as a swift action. You gain fast healing 3 for 1 minute. Pulpy, tumorous fl esh erupts from your wounds to seal your injuries.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Glasya)	DESC:&nl;Baalzebul: This brand causes your body to sweat a glistening slime. You gain a +4 bonus on grapple and Escape Artist checks. Your natural attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of acid damage.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Baalzebul)	DESC:&nl;Mephistopheles: The brand of Mephistopheles burns with unholy energy. Three times per day, as a swift action, you can invoke those fl ames to wreathe your body. For 1 round, all of your natural attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of fi re damage. If you are grappled or struck by an unarmed attack, your attacker takes 1d6 points of fi re damage. At the start of each of your turns, any creatures in squares adjacent to you take 1d6 points of fi re damage.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Mephistopheles)	DESC:&nl;Asmodeus: The brand of Asmodeus fi lls you with power and authority. Three times per day as a swift action, you can use command, as the spell, as a spell-like ability. Special: Once a character gains a brand of the Nine Hells, it can never gain the brand of another archdevil. Nondevils can gain this feat, and the feats that require it as a prerequisite, by performing a particularly useful act for an archduke of Hell. This option is unavailable to player characters (unless a DM rules otherwise).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Brand Of The Nine Hells(Asmodeus)

PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Con 15, Devil's Favor.	BENEFIT:You gain a bonus to your natural armor and on Intimidate checks equal to half the number of devil-touched feats you have selected, including this one.

Devil's Tongue		TYPE:Devil-Touched	CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:You gain a devil's talent for trickery and deceit. Your words form a verbal maze that clouds your opponent's mind. As a physical mark of this ability, your tongue becomes forked like a serpent's.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Cha 15, Devil's Favor.	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can speak soothing words of friendship and amity to any opponent within 60 feet. The target must be able to hear and understand you. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifi er) or be dazed for 1 round. In addition, he is rendered fl at-footed. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of devil-touched feats you possess. You can choose to spend two uses of this ability to use it as a swift action rather than as a standard action. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent, supernatural ability.
Dilate Aura			TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:You can extend the range of your aura.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Aura ability.	BENEFIT:Once per encounter, you can double the range of your aura. The expanded aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifi er (minimum 1 round).
Disrupting Spell		TYPE:Metamagic		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:You can cast spells that disrupt other caster's magical capabilities.	BENEFIT:You can alter a spell so it interferes with one or more targets' supernatural and spell-like abilities, as well as any spells they cast. A disrupting spell temporarily reduces the save DC of any spell, spell-like, or supernatural ability the affected creature or creatures can cast or use by 2. The effect of a disrupting spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell's unmodifi ed level. Multiple disrupting spells do not stack. A disrupting spell has no effect on magic items. A disrupting spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
Divine Censure		TYPE:Divine			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:You can channel divine energy to instill fear in evil outsiders.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to turn undead, good alignment.

PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Divine caster level 3rd, ability to turn or rebuke undead.	BENEFIT:You can spend one of your turn or rebuke undead attempts as an immediate action to counter a spell or spelllike effect. For example, if an evil cleric targets Jozan with a hold person spell, as an immediate action, Jozan can spend a turn undead attempt to counter the spell if he had prepared a hold person or dispel magic spell. You must have the relevant spell prepared as normal (or dispel magic), and you must make a Spellcraft check to identify the target's spell if applicable. (See PH 170 for details on counterspells.) Normal: You must typically use a readied action to counter an enemy's spell.
Divine Justice		TYPE:Divine			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:You can channel divine energy to deal extra melee damage to evil outsiders.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Mark Of Avernus		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Your unfailing allegiance to Bel gives you special strategic insights into the best ways to overcome your enemies. By examining your opponents, you can land telling blows.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Bel.	BENEFIT:You are a master strategist. Once per encounter, you can make a single ranged attack, melee attack, or use one of your spell-like abilities as an immediate action. In addition, whenever you successfully hit an opponent with an attack made as part of a readied action, you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll and damage roll, and you automatically confi rm a critical threat on such an attack.
Mark Of Cania		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Behind Mephistopheles's mask of civility and quick wit burns the fi re of frustration and hatred. You acquire this archdevil's temperament, and you can channel it to destroy your foes.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Mephistopheles.	BENEFIT:The passionate anger for which Mephistopheles is famed burns brightly in you. Each round when you miss on an attack roll or a target successfully saves against a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability you have cast or used, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and checks. This bonus lasts until you successfully hit a target or until a target fails a saving throw against one of your spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural effects. For every +1 bonus you gain, you also take a -1 penalty to Armor Class. This penalty disappears when the bonus no longer applies.
Mark Of Dis			TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:The infernal attention of Dispater has made you paranoid and cautious, giving you decided advantages in combat. Your attention to detail in battle leaves few openings for your opponents to attack.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Dispater.	BENEFIT:The only devils that survive for long in the labyrinthine streets of Dis are those with Dispater's preparedness and unfl agging paranoia.

Mark Of Maladomini	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Maladomini is a sinking mire of corruption and filth. Those who serve the Lord of Flies acquire some of his most unsavory characteristics. You exude stinking ichor like your master.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Baalzebul.	BENEFIT:You share the curse of your foul master, Baalzebul. Your body issues forth a steady stream of filth that collects about you. Any creature that enters or leaves a square adjacent to you must succeed on a Balance check (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifier) or immediately stop moving. A creature that fails this check and attempts to keep moving immediately falls prone in its current space. In addition, this slime reeks of decay, excrement, and worse, forcing any living creature within 10 feet of you to succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifi er) or become sickened for 10 rounds. Regardless of the outcome of the save, a creature cannot again be affected by your stench for 24 hours.
Mark Of Malbolge		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Malbolge has transformed into a place of disturbing growth and decay.

Each round, as a swift action, you can draw strength from one of these cancerous growths to gain one of the following benefi ts: * +10-foot enhancement bonus to your base speed for 1 round. * Heal 2d6 points of damage +1 point per Hit Die. * Increase your natural reach with your melee attacks by 5 feet for 1 round. * Spray a stream of noxious fi lth at an adjacent target, forcing that creature to succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifier) or become sickened for 1 round. Spent tumors regrow in 10 rounds.
Mark Of Minauros		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Mammon is an expert at managing the various powers of Hell. From service to this archdevil, you know when to use explosive violence and when to beat a hasty retreat.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Mammon.	BENEFIT:Like your master, you know when to fi ght and when to fl ee. When making a charge attack, you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll at the end of the charge for every 10 feet you move as part of the charge (in addition to the normal attack bonus from charging). In addition, when you move (and only when you move), the square in which you start your movement is not considered threatened. Normal: You gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll at the end of a charge. Withdrawing is a full-round action.
Mark Of Nessus		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:All bow before Asmodeus. The Lord of Nessus grants you a hint of his commanding nature.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Asmodeus.	BENEFIT:Few have the resolve necessary to confront Asmodeus himself, and you have learned to tap into this commanding authority. Whenever a creature would attack you, target you with a spell, or use spell-like or supernatural ability against you, it must fi rst succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Cha modifi er). If it fails, it must select another target or take some other action. Once an opponent succeeds on the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by your Mark of Nessus for 24 hours. In addition, once per round as a swift action, you can infuse a single natural attack with hellfi re, dealing an extra 1d6 points of damage.
Mark Of Phlegethos	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:The disturbing infatuation of physical pleasure and pain has indelibly touched your mind, enabling to draw strength from your own suffering, as well as that of others.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Belial or Fierna.	BENEFIT:You gain your master's or mistress's penchant for perverse sensuality. Whenever you take or deal damage, you gain 1 pleasure point. You can spend a single pleasure point as a swift action to gain a +4 bonus on your next attack roll, save, or ability or skill check. Accumulated pleasure points disappear at the end of the encounter.
Mark Of Stygia		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:Levistus demands that his servants work endlessly to extract him from his icy tomb. From your time on the glacier, you have learned to use your environment to best advantage.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Brand of the Nine Hells, allegiance to Levistus.	BENEFIT:Those who serve Levistus are accustomed to the inhospitable cold and ice of Stygia. You never need to make Balance checks when on slippery or severely slippery surfaces, and you can move at full speed over any terrain that would ordinarily require a Balance check. Whenever both you and an opponent stand on icy or frozen surfaces, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. Finally, each round as a swift action, you can limn a weapon you wield with Stygian cold for 1 round. On a successful hit, this weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage. If the weapon is made of Baatorian green steel (see page 99), it deals an extra 2d6 points of cold damage instead.
Persistent Refusal	TYPE:Divine			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:You can channel divine energy to make a second save against an effect that specifi cally targets you.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to turn or rebuke undead.	BENEFIT:As a swift action, spend one of your turn or rebuke undead attempts to make another save against any effect that targets you and has a continuing duration.

Pious Defiance		TYPE:Divine			CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:You can channel positive or negative energy to firm your resolve.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ability to turn or rebuke undead.	BENEFIT:You can spend a turn or rebuke attempt as an immediate action to gain a bonus on Will saves equal to 1/2 your character level for 1 round.

BENEFIT:The amount of nonlethal damage removed by your regeneration ability increases by 1. Special: You can select this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.
Supernatural Instincts	TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:Your uncanny insight enables you to take advantage of the subtle opportunities created when an opponent uses supernatural abilities against you.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Combat Refl exes.	BENEFIT:When a creature you threaten uses a supernatural ability, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. Unlike a spell or spell-like ability, though, a successful hit does not require the target to succeed on a Concentration check to continue to make use of the supernatural ability. Normal: Supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Undo Resistance		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:You learn to use cold iron weapons to unravel your opponent's magical defenses with a well-placed sneak attack.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Sneak attack, sudden strike, or skirmish ability.	BENEFIT:If you successfully deal sneak attack damage with a cold iron weapon, you reduce the target's spell resistance by 1 point per die of sneak attack damage. Multiple uses of this feat stack. Undo Resistance can reduce a target's spell resistance to 0, but not below 0. Spell resistance reduced in this manner returns to normal 1 hour after the last sneak attack. Special: You also gain this benefit with skirmish and sudden strike damage. Your DM might also allow you to use this feat with similar special abilities that grant you extra dice of damage against fl at-footed or fl anked opponents.
Vengeful Surge		TYPE:General		CATEGORY:FEAT	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:Opponents who target you with magical effects risk sparking your ire.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Iron Will.	BENEFIT:Whenever you make a successful saving throw against a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect, for 1 round you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls against the creature that targeted you.
