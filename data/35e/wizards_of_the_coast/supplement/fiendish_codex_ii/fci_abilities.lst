Evil Exception		KEY:Hellbred ~ Evil Exception			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbred Race Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:Regardless of alignment or class restrictions, a hellbred can cast spells with the evil descriptor and never gains negative levels while wielding evil magic items, such as unholy weapons or demon armor. This ability does not shield a hellbred from losing access to class features if he violates a class's code of conduct. For example, using a +1 unholy longsword to slay orcs would not violate a hellbred paladin's code of conduct, though using the weapon to kill another paladin would.
Hellbound			KEY:Hellbred ~ Hellbound			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbred Race Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:A devil has a claim on a hellbred's soul. As a result, a hellbred can be restored to life only by a resurrection spell or greater magic.

###Block - Hellbreaker
Mantle of Darkness		KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Mantle of Darkness			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:You can make Hide checks in any kind of darkness, even when observed by creatures that can see in darkness.
Telepathic Static			KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Telepathic Static				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, you emit a field of psychic chatter out to a range of 20 feet, negating the telepathy ability of all creatures within range. In addition, divination spells and spell-like abilities cast or used in the area are impeded. To use divination magic, a caster must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell or spell-like ability does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell, spell slot, or daily use. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally. You can suppress this ability for 1 round as a free action.
Steal Spell-Like Ability	KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Steal Spell-Like Ability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal a creature's spelllike ability. If you hit an opponent with a sneak attack, you can choose to forgo 2d6 dice of sneak attack damage and instead gain one use of one of the target's spell-like abilities. If the target is willing, you can steal a spell-like ability with a touch as a standard action (you do not need to damage a willing target). This spell-like ability can originate from the target's class, race, template, or any other source, and can be of any spell level up to a maximum of 1/2 your class level. You can select a specific spell-like ability to borrow; otherwise, the DM chooses the ability at random. If the ability has a limited number of uses per day, the target must have at least one such use left, or you can't steal the ability. If the target can't use its ability (such as a summoned devil's summon ability), you can't steal it. If you steal and use an ability with limited uses per day, your use of the ability also counts as one use for the target creature. You can use a stolen spell-like ability once. For all purposes (caster level, save DC, and so on), treat the spell-like ability as if the creature whose ability you stole were using it. You must use the stolen spell-like ability within 1 minute of acquiring it, or it is lost. Until you use the ability (or until 1 minute elapses), the target cannot use the stolen ability. If you have a similar ability, such as the spellthief's steal spell-like ability (Complete Adventurer 19), you can steal two spell-like abilities at once, but each is subject to its respective spell level restriction. Once you have stolen a spell-like ability, you cannot use neutralize spell-like ability (see below) until you have used the stolen ability.
Sneak Attack			KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Sneak Attack				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, you deal extra damage when you are fl anking an opponent or at any time when a target would be denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if a target is within 30 feet. (See the rogue class feature, PH 50.) This extra damage increases to +2d6 at 6th level and +3d6 at 9th level. If you have levels in another class that grants sneak attack damage, the extra damage stacks.
Stowaway				KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Stowaway					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:From 4th level on, you can hitch a ride on a conjuration (teleportation) spell or spell-like ability cast or used within 30 feet of you. If the target is unwilling, you must succeed on a level check with a DC of 10 + the caster level of the effect as an immediate action. If the target is willing, this ability functions automatically. When the spell is cast, you appear wherever the caster appears, in the same position you were at the time of the spell's casting. If this would force you to appear in a solid object, you appear in the nearest open available space. If the conjuration spell has variable results, such as teleport, you suffer the same effect as the caster.
Neutralize Spell-Like Ability	KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Neutralize Spell-Like Ability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, you gain the ability to neutralize one of a target's spell-like abilities. This ability functions like the steal spell-like ability class feature, except you do not gain the ability to use the spell-like ability. Instead, you prevent the target from using the ability for a number of rounds equal to your class level. You cannot use this ability while holding a stolen spell-like ability. You can neutralize any number of spell-like abilities.
Foil Summoning			KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Foil Summoning				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 7th level, your telepathic static intensifies so that you also impede conjuration (calling) and conjuration (summoning) spells and spell-like effects within 20 feet. See telepathic static, above, for details.
Steal Supernatural Ability	KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Steal Supernatural Ability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:From 8th level on, you can steal supernatural abilities. This ability functions like the steal spell-like ability class feature. While in possession of a stolen spell-like or supernatural ability, you cannot use steal spell-like ability, steal supernatural ability, or neutralize spell-like ability again until you lose access to the stolen ability (by discharging it or after 1 minute, whichever comes first).
Plane Hop				KEY:Hellbreaker ~ Plane Hop					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellbreaker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 10th level, you can use plane shift as an immediate action once per day. This ability functions like the spell, but it has a range of personal and a target of you.

###Block - Hellfire Warlock
Hellfire Blast		KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Hellfire Blast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:Whenever you use your eldritch blast ability, you can change your eldritch blast into a hell fire blast. A hellfire blast deals your normal eldritch blast damage plus an extra 2d6 points of damage per class level. If your blast hits multiple targets (for example, the eldritch chain or eldritch cone blast shape invocations), each target takes the extra damage. This damage is not fire damage. Hellfire burns hotter than any normal fire, as described in the sidebar on page 119. Each time you use this ability, you take 1 point of Constitution damage. Because the diabolical forces behind the power of hellfire demand part of your essence in exchange for this granted power, if you do not have a Constitution score or are somehow immune to Constitution damage, you cannot use this ability.
Invoking			KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Invoking				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At each level, you gain new invocations known, increased damage with eldritch blast, and an increase in invoker level as if you had also gained a level in the warlock class. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.	BONUS:VAR|CasterLevelBLWarlock|HellfireWarlockLVL	BONUS:VAR|WarlockEldritchBlastLVL|HellfireWarlockLVL
Resistance to Fire 10	KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Resistance to Fire 10		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:At 2nd level, you gain resistance to fire 10. This resistance stacks with any resistance to fire you have gained from warlock class levels.	BONUS:VAR|FireResistanceBonus|10
Hellfire Infusion		KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Hellfire Infusion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, you can infuse magic items that you wield with the power of hellfire. Whenever you use a charged magic item (such as a wand or a staff ), you can apply one of the following metamagic effects to your next use of the item: empower, enlarge, widen, or energy substitution. These effects work just like the metamagic feats of the same name (the Energy Substitution feat is described on page 79 of Complete Arcane). Using hellfire infusion is a swift action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one). When you infuse an item with hellfire, it glows briefl y with fiery symbols that are disturbing to look upon.
Hellfire Shield		KEY:Hellfire Warlock ~ Hellfire Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellfire Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.90	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you can call up hellfire to surround yourself with a protective barrier. Whenever someone directs a melee attack against you, you can, as an immediate action, aim a blast of hellfire at that creature. This blast deals damage equal to your eldritch blast (including bonus damage from the hellfire blast ability). This blast automatically strikes the target, which can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). Each time you use this ability, you take 1 point of Constitution damage. Because the diabolical forces behind the power of hellfire demand part of your essence in exchange for this granted power, if you do not have a Constitution score or are somehow immune to Constitution damage, you cannot use this ability.

###Block - Hellreaver
Holy Fury			KEY:Hellreaver ~ Holy Fury				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:When you face your enemies, a raging anger fills your mind. Avenging, divine power surges through you, allowing you to generate magical effects. Entering this state is a free action. While in a holy fury, your melee attacks are good-aligned. You also gain immunity to fear effects. In addition, you gain a number of holy fury points equal to your hellreaver level plus your Charisma modifier. You spend these points to activate many of your hellreaver class abilities. You can use holy fury once per encounter. It lasts until the end of the encounter.
Furious Strike		KEY:Hellreaver ~ Furious Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:As a swift action, you can spend 1 holy fury point to pour divine energy into your weapon. Your blade crackles with a divine aura that is baneful to your foes. You gain a +2 bonus and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage on your next attack. These bonuses apply only to an attack that targets an evil creature. If you accidentally use furious strike against a creature that is not evil, or your attack misses, the furious strike has no effect, but the holy fury point is still spent. At 4th level, these bonuses increase to +4 on your attack roll and an extra 2d6 points of damage. At 7th level, these bonuses increase to +6 on your attack roll and an extra 3d6 points of damage. At 10th level, these bonuses increase to +8 on your attack roll and an extra 4d6 points of damage.
Divine Succor		KEY:Hellreaver ~ Divine Succor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:Just as your divine power can slay evil creatures, it can also mend wounds suffered by the just. Beginning at 2nd level, as a swift action, you can spend 1 holy fury point to heal 10 points of damage. You can apply this healing to yourself or any good-aligned creature within 20 feet. At 5th level, you can heal 20 points of damage. At 8th level, you can heal 30 points of damage.
Divine Resolve		KEY:Hellreaver ~ Divine Resolve			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:From 3rd level on, you can draw upon your fury to push aside the effect of a spell cast by your foes, a monster's poison, and so forth. As an immediate action, you can spend 1 holy fury point to gain a +2 bonus on your next saving throw. You can use this ability after attempting a save but before you learn whether it succeeded or failed.
Divine Shield		KEY:Hellreaver ~ Divine Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:When you attain 3rd level, you can focus your divine power into a shield that knocks aside a foe's attack with a mighty shout. As an immediate action, you can spend 1 holy fury point to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against the next attack you face. You can use this ability after a foe attacks you but before you learn whether this attack hit or missed.
Mettle			KEY:Hellreaver ~ Mettle					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, if you make a successful Fortitude or Will save that would normally reduce (rather than negate) a spell's effect, you suffer no effect from the spell at all. Only those spells with a Saving Throw entry of "Will partial," "Fortitude half," or similar entries can be negated through this ability.
Heroic Sacrifice		KEY:Hellreaver ~ Heroic Sacrifice			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:From 5th level on, as a swift action, you can voluntarily take 2 points of Constitution damage to fully replenish your holy fury points.
Call to Judgment		KEY:Hellreaver ~ Call to Judgment			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:With your foe near defeat, you cry out to the gods for justice. Gleaming white chains appear around your enemy, preventing it from using dimensional travel. At 6th level and beyond, as a swift action, you can spend 3 holy fury points to charge your weapon with divine power. If your next melee attack hits an evil outsider, the target suffers the effect of a dimensional anchor spell, with a caster level equal to your hellreaver level.
Improved Divine Resolve	KEY:Hellreaver ~ Improved Divine Resolve		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:At 9th level, your divine resolve ability improves. This ability functions like the divine resolve class feature, except that you can now spend 2 holy fury points as an immediate action to gain a +4 bonus on a saving throw.
Improved Divine Shield	KEY:Hellreaver ~ Improved Divine Shield		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:When you reach 9th level, your divine shield grows stronger. This ability functions like divine shield, except that you can now spend 2 holy fury points as an immediate action to gain a +4 bonus to AC.
Divine Retribution	KEY:Hellreaver ~ Divine Retribution			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hellreaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:By channeling divine energy into an evil outsider, you can destroy its physical form in a spectacular explosion. As your weapon cuts into its body, you funnel holy energy into it. At 10th level, once per day as a swift action, you can spend 4 holy fury points to imbue your next attack with a mighty aura of avenging divine power. If this attack hits an outsider that has the evil subtype, the target must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). If it fails this save, the target explodes in a fl ash of light. It is slain, and all evil creatures in a 60-foot-radius burst around it are blinded for 1 round. There is no saving throw to resist this blindness. On a successful save, the target instead takes 10d6 points of damage as holy energy burns through its body, and the blinding effect does not trigger. This damage is in addition to your attack's normal damage.

###Block - Soulguard
Spellcasting		KEY:Soulguard ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulguard Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At each level above 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a soulguard, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.
Pierce Deception		KEY:Soulguard ~ Pierce Deception			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulguard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:You gain the ability to channel your spell power to pierce all deceptions. For a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one), as a standard action, you can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot to use true seeing, as the spell (no material component needed). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, and you can target only yourself with this spell-like ability. The caster level equals your caster level.
Divine Rebuke		KEY:Soulguard ~ Divine Rebuke				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulguard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, as a swift action, you can sacrifice a spell slot or a prepared spell to rebuke an evil outsider within 30 feet.

Absolution			KEY:Soulguard ~ Absolution				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulguard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:Starting at 4th level, you gain the ability to use atonement once per day as a spell-like ability. Alternatively, if you are using the corruption mechanics from this book, you can purify a creature to redeem it from evil. Only a creature that desires absolution can be affected. Furthermore, any gains (monetary, political, personal, and so on) a creature has attained through evil acts must be abandoned. If the target creature has 3 or fewer corruption points, they are all removed. If the creature has 4 or more corruption points, you can reduce the total by 1. A single creature cannot receive the benefit of absolution more than once unless the DM permits it for exceptional story-driven reasons. For more information on corruption, see page 30.
Immunity to Compulsion	KEY:Soulguard ~ Immunity to Compulsion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Soulguard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 5th level, you gain immunity to enchantment (compulsion) spells and effects.
