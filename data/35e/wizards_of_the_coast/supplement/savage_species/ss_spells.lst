Material Component: The brain of a humanoid that has been dead less than 8 hours. XP Cost: 5,000 XP.
Awaken Undead		KEY:Awaken Undead					SOURCEPAGE:p.63	SCHOOL:Necromancy	DESCRIPTOR:Evil	CLASSES:Cleric=6|Sorcerer,Wizard=7	COMPS:V, S, M, XP	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:All mindless undead within a circle 25 ft. in radius plus 5 ft./ 2 levels	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:None (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell grants Intelligence to mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies. Undead with Intelligence scores are unaffected. Each mindless undead creature within the radius gains an Intelligence score of 1d6+4. A subject of the spell cannot gain a higher Intelligence than is typical for its original kind. A skeletal dog simply has Intelligence 2, while a skeletal orc uses the 1d6+4 die roll but can't have a score higher than 8. Awakened undead do not regain any skills, feats, or extraordinary abilities they had in life, but they do gain skill points ([4 + Int mod] x HD)and feats (one for first Hit Die, one for each three HD thereafter) normally after being awakened. Undead regain the armor and weapon proficiencies they had in life (assume the undead were formerly NPC warriors unless your DM specifies otherwise) and will don armor and take up weapons while obeying your commands. A zombie fighter can wear any armor and wield any simple or martial weapon, while a zombie warhorse can wear any armor. Awakened undead gain a +2 profane bonus on their Will saving throws to resist being controlled. Material Component: A humanoid fingerbone. XP Cost: 200 XP.

The subject may do so every round while the spell is in effect. The subject gestures with the natural weapon as if making a melee attack. The effect of this attack always emanates from the subject's location. The attack does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. The subject uses its highest melee attack bonus, and deals damage normally if it hits. All normal modifiers to ranged combat apply. If the subject has more than one natural weapon, it may choose which weapon to use during each round the spell is in effect.
Bridge Of Sound		KEY:Bridge Of Sound					SOURCEPAGE:p.63	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	DESCRIPTOR:Sonic	CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=3	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:One bridge of sound 5 ft. wide, 1 in. thick, and up to 10 ft./ level long	DURATION:Concentration plus 1 round/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create a ribbonlike, weightless, unbreakable, invisible bridge of sound. The bridge must be anchored to solid objects at both ends, but otherwise can be at any angle. Like a wall of force, it must be continuous and unbroken when formed. It is typically used to cross a chasm or a hazardous space. Creatures can move on the bridge of sound without penalty, sinced it is no more slippery than a typical dungeon floor. It is only a physical barrier to solid objects and has no effect on spells, line of sight, gaze attacks, ethereal creatures, or incorporeal creatures and objects. The bridge of sound can support a maximum of 200 pounds per caster level. Creatures that cause the total weight on the bridge of sound to exceed this limit sink through the bridge as if it weren't there. A bridge of sound is temporarily negated within the area of a silence spell, causing anything on it to fall. If the silence effect ends or is dispelled before the bridge's duration expires, the bridge is once again whole.
Buoyant Lifting		KEY:Buoyant Lifting					SOURCEPAGE:p.64	SCHOOL:Evocation	CLASSES:Druid=2	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One willing swimming or floating creature or object (total weight up to 200 lb./level)	DURATION:10 minutes/level (D) (see text)	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You command the water supporting or surrounding a swimming or floating creature or object to rise and hold the creature above the surface of the water. An object so lifted may contain creatures or other objects (for example, a boat). The creature must be willing to be lifted in this manner, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. The spell causes a smooth wave of water to rise under the subject and hold it 20 feet above the rest of the water's surface. If obstructions prevent the subject from being raised that high (such as being in a cave with a low ceiling), the wave lifts the subject until it touches the obstruction. The subject is otherwise resting at the top of this wave (rescuing it from drowning if it was a sinking air-breather) and can swim away under its own power or be moved by others (such as with a rope). If the subject is removed from the wave, it collapses gently and the spell ends.
Cacophonic Burst		KEY:Cacophonic Burst					SOURCEPAGE:p.64	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Sonic	CLASSES:Bard=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=5	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)	TARGETAREA:20-ft.-radius burst	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex half	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You cause a burst of low, discordant noise to erupt at the chosen location.

The subject retains whatever form he or she had when the spell was cast for the duration; even death does not cause reversion to normal form until the spell ends. Natural lycanthropes gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw against this spell. Material Component: A hair, scale, or other cast-off item from the creature to be affected.
Crawling Darkness		KEY:Crawling Darkness					SOURCEPAGE:p.64	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation	CLASSES:Cleric=5	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 full round	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)	DESC:You bring into being a shroud of dark, writhing tentacles around your body. The tentacles do not interfere with your movement or spellcasting, but they provide you one-half concealment (20%% miss chance) and totally hide your features. You get a +4 competence bonus on grapple checks, Climb checks, and Escape Artist checks. Crawling darkness automatically protects you with a feather fall effect if you ever fall more than 3 feet and allows you to use water walk at will.
Dawn				KEY:Dawn							SOURCEPAGE:p.64	SCHOOL:Abjuration	CLASSES:Druid=0|Ranger=1	COMPS:V	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:All creatures within a 15-ft.- radius burst centered on you	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:All sleeping creatures in the affected area awaken. Those who are unconscious because of subdual damage wake up and become staggered (see Subdual Damage in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). This spell does not affect dying creatures.
Desiccating Bubble	KEY:Desiccating Bubble				SOURCEPAGE:p.65	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2	COMPS:S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:3-ft.-radius sphere of air	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:A globe of supernaturally dry air rolls in whichever direction you point and engulfs those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round and can leap up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d4 points of damage as it evaporates moisture from the target. (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save.) Oozes, creatures composed of water (such as water elementals), and creatures with the aquatic subtype take 2d6 points of damage. The bubble moves as long as you actively direct it (a move-equivalent action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest. The surface of the bubble has a spongy, yielding consistency (similar to that of a soap bubble, but not fragile and allowing objects to pass through it without affecting the spell) and so does not cause damage except by absorbing moisture. It cannot batter down large obstacles. The bubble winks out if it exceeds the spell's range. Arcane Material Component: A tiny bag or bladder filled with air, and a sprinkle of dust.
Dissonant Chant		KEY:Dissonant Chant					SOURCEPAGE:p.65	SCHOOL:Abjuration	DESCRIPTOR:Sonic	CLASSES:Bard=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=2	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:100-foot radius emanation	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	SAVEINFO:None (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create a distracting and discordant chant. Affected creatures that attempt spellcasting or other activities that require concentration must make Concentration checks (DC 18 + Int or Cha modifier, for wizards or sorcerers respectively) to succeed. Activities that already require Concentration checks, such as casting defensively, have their DC increased by the save DC of this spell -10. For example, this spell cast by a wizard with 14 Intelligence would have a DC of 14; a cleric trying to cast spiritual weapon within the area would have to succeed on a Concentration check against DC 21 (15 + 2 for spiritual weapon spell level + 14 for dissonant chant save DC - 10 = 21). Creatures within the area gain a bonus on saving throws against language- dependent effects equal to this spell's DC -10. While this spell does not allow a saving throw, the save DC for the spell is calculated normally (10 + spell level + Int or Cha modifier) to determine the modifier to the Concentration checks of those within the spell's area.
Dream Casting		KEY:Dream Casting					SOURCEPAGE:p.65	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Phantasm	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=6	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 hour	RANGE:Unlimited	TARGETAREA:You and one dreamer	DURATION:1 day/level (see text)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless) and Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless) and yes	DESC:As the dream spell, except as noted above; also, you can alter the sleeping person's dreams to produce a specific desired effect. The dreamer gets a Will saving throw to resist the additional effects of this spell; if he succeeds, the dream casting spell can only send a message in the manner of the dream spell. If the saving throw fails, you decide what additional effect the message carries. Fear: Your image in the dream is surrounded by intimidating imagery and an aura of power. For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he is shaken. This is a compulsion and fear effect. &nl;Charm: Your image in the dream appears particularly helpful and kind. For the duration of the spell, the dreamer is under the effect of a charm monster spell. This is a charm effect. Rage: Your image in the dream taunts and harasses the dreamer. For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he preferentially attacks you if in a combat situation. The dreamer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls while under this effect. This is a compulsion effect. &nl;Harrow: Your image in the dream behaves in a bizarre and irrational manner. For the duration of the spell, the dreamer behaves in an unusual manner, gaining two random traits from Table 5-5: One Hundred Traits in the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide (reroll any physical traits, such as baldness). If the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he acts bewildered.

Embrace The Wild		KEY:Embrace The Wild					SOURCEPAGE:p.65	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Druid=3|Ranger=3	COMPS:V, F	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:10 minutes/level	DESC:This spell allows you to adopt the nature and some abilities of a wild animal. You retain your own form, but you gain the natural and extraordinary senses of the creature you choose, as well as its skill ranks (though these do not stack with any ranks you already have in the same skills), for the duration of the spell. Thus, depending on your choice of animal, you could gain blindsight, scent, and ranks in Listen, Spot, or other skills. Embrace the wild does not grant you the animal's natural attacks, methods of locomotion, feats, or nonsensory extraordinary abilities, such as trample or improved grab. Focus: Hide, skin, or feathers of the selected animal, or an item or component of its lair. You must have obtained the focus from the animal yourself.
Extend Tentacles		KEY:Extend Tentacles					SOURCEPAGE:p.66	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=4|Sorcerer,Wizard=4	COMPS:V, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round/level	DESC:Originally developed by medusas, this spell lengthens your tentacles, increasing the reach of your tentacle attacks by 5 feet. The tentacles attack as normal. This spell can also increase the length of a medusa's snakes so they may make normal attacks with a 10-foot reach, or they may start a grapple after a successful attack as if you had the improved grab ability. If the snakes get a successful hold, they can constrict on any following round for 1d3 points of damage plus your Strength modifier with a successful grapple check.
Fins To Feet		KEY:Fins To Feet					SOURCEPAGE:p.66	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=2	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 minute	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell transforms tails or finned extremities into humanoid legs and feet.

Attacks with these flaming whips replace any natural attacks you had with those limbs, and deal 5d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20) each. While this spell is in effect, you may not cast spells with material components, nor may you carry items with your forelimbs. Any items worn on your forelimbs cease functioning while the spell is active.

The spell grants an enhancement bonus to Intelligence of 1d4+1 points, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-related skills.

Fuse Arms			KEY:Fuse Arms						SOURCEPAGE:p.66	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=3	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature with at least four arms or tentacles touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You cause a creature's multiple arms or tentacles to fuse together into a single pair of stronger limbs. Only limbs that the creature can use as arms or grasping limbs are affected by the spell (so basilisks and monstrous centipedes, neither of which use their limbs to attack or manipulate objects, are unaffected). For every set of limbs fused into the primary set of limbs, the creature gains +4 to Strength when using those fused limbs (affecting activities that would use those limbs, but not activities relying on its bite, legs, and so on). For example, a girallon under the effect of this spell would have one pair of arms and Strength 30 for the purpose of using those arms. A behir, which has three pairs of limbs that it can use as arms, wound end up with one pair of arm-limbs with a +8 bonus to Strength for those arms (its six legs would be unaffected). The loss of limbs reduces the number of attacks available to the subject.
Girallon's Blessing	KEY:Girallon's Blessing				SOURCEPAGE:p.66	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=3	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You give the subject one additional pair of arms for every four caster levels. Each arm ends in a hand with fingers and an opposable thumb. The spell can create a maximum of five pairs of arms, but the size of the subject limits the number of pairs of additional arms it can have: one for Small, two for Medium-size, three for Large, or four for a Huge or larger creature. The creature's original arms (if any) are its primary arms, and all others are secondary limbs (if the subject had no arms, the arms created by the spell are its primary arms). The new limbs can be confusing. In a stressful or demanding situation, such as combat, the subject must make a Will save (DC 19) or take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks until the situation passes. Nonmagical clothing or armor is destroyed by the transformation, but magic armor and clothing shifts to accommodate the new arms. The additional arms do not allow additional attacks or several simultaneous physical tasks. They do not increase the subject's reach. However, they do allow the subject to use items designed for creatures with more than two arms, or to use a two-handed item and another piece of equipment. For instance, a subject could wield a greatsword while using a shield. Material Component: A few strands of girallon hair.
Hailstones			KEY:Hailstones						SOURCEPAGE:p.67	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Cold	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=3	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One frigid globe/five levels	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:See text	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You create frigid globes that strike your enemies. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack roll to hit. The hailstone deals 5d6 points of cold damage (Reflex save half ).

Material Component: A handful of crystal globes.
Holy Star			KEY:Holy Star						SOURCEPAGE:p.67	SCHOOL:Abjuration	CLASSES:Cleric=7	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:Protective star of energy	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	DESC:You create a glowing mote of energy that stays near your shoulder, providing light equal to a candle. It has three functions, and you can designate which function to activate as a free action on your turn. Spell Turning: The holy star can turn 1d4+3 spell levels as the spell turning spell. Any spell levels turned are gone for the remainder of the spell (the holy star does not recover these spent levels every time you choose this function). If all spell levels are expended, this function no longer works, but the other functions still do. Cover: The holy star gives you a +10 cover bonus to Armor Class without affecting your actions. Fire Bolt: The holy star lashes out with a beam of energy as a ranged touch attack against a creature up to 90 feet away, dealing fire damage equal to 1d4 +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10).
Illusory Pit		KEY:Illusory Pit					SOURCEPAGE:p.67	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Figment	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Image 10 ft. by 10 ft. by 20 ft.	DURATION:Permanent	SAVEINFO:Will disbelief (if interacted with)	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell creates the illusion of a pit 10 feet square and 20 feet deep. It may be cast on a flat surface (such as a floor) or in an open space (such as on an actual pit to conceal its contents). It appears absolutely real when viewed. If it is cast on a solid floor, objects dropped into the pit do not fall, instead resting in place on top of the pit as if levitating or as if the pit were covered with a wall of force. If it is cast in an open space, objects dropped into the pit appear to fall into it until they pass below the bottom of the spell's area (at which point they vanish) or come to rest on a solid object within the spell's area (at which point they appear to float within the pit). Detection abilities that do not require sight work normally on the pit, instantly revealing it to be illusory (for example, a creature with blindsight or a character feeling the ground with a pole would realize that there is no pit) or covered in some invisible way. Touching the illusion does not cause it to disappear. The bottom of the illusory pit may be bare, or it may contain metal spikes, a humanoid skeleton, filth, or any combination you desire, chosen at the casting of the spell.

This field of energy has the following effects upon anything that touches or enters it. First, all creatures except you take 1 point of damage per caster level. Spell resistance applies to the damage (but not the other effects of the spell). Those affected by the spell make a Will saving throw every round. A successful saving throw halves the damage in that round. Second, the chaotic energy makes it difficult to concentrate. Any activity that involves concentration (such as casting a spell or using a spell-like ability) requires a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to succeed. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this spell. Material Component: A jawbone with teeth.

You can also animate masses of raw matter, such as water, a rock from a wall, or a rock on the ground, as long as the volume of material does not exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. For each cubic foot of volume, the animated object has 1 Hit Die. The object gains an Intelligence score (roll 3d6) and a Charisma score (roll 1d3) from the spell. Other statistics for animated objects are found in the Monster Manual. Material Component: A piece or handful of material of the same type as the object to be animated. XP Cost: 250 XP per cubic foot of material affected.
Plant Body			KEY:Plant Body						SOURCEPAGE:p.69	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Druid=6	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You imbue the subject with powerful transformative magic, granting it some of the characteristics of the plant type. The subject's skin becomes covered over with moss and ivy, not unlike the appearance of a shambling mound. Any spell or effect that affects plant creatures also affects the subject. A plant creature is immune to critical hits, mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. The subject's ability scores, skills, and feats are unaffected (although its new form may make it difficult or impossible for the subject to use certain skills or feats).
Rapid Burrowing		KEY:Rapid Burrowing					SOURCEPAGE:p.69	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=2|Druid=1|Ranger=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=2	COMPS:V, S, F/DF	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell increases the touched creature's burrow speed by 20 feet. It has no effect on other modes of movement, nor does it allow the subject to burrow if it cannot already do so or the ability to burrow through stone if it cannot already do so.
Rejection			KEY:Rejection						SOURCEPAGE:p.69		CLASSES:Cleric=6	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:Cone	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	DESC:As repulsion, except as noted above.
Scent				KEY:Scent							SOURCEPAGE:p.69		SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Druid=2|Ranger=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=2	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 hour/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You give the subject an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of some monsters. This ability allows the creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. For more details, see Scent in the introduction to the Monster Manual. Arcane Material Component: A sprinkle of mustard and pepper, and a drop of sweat.
Skeletal Guard		KEY:Skeletal Guard					SOURCEPAGE:p.69	SCHOOL:Necromancy	DESCRIPTOR:Evil	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One or more fingerbones	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:You create a number of loyal skeletons from fingerbones. All skeletons are Medium-size, with the normal Monster Manual statistics for their kind, except that their effective Hit Dice as far as turning is concerned is equal to your caster level. You can create one skeleton per caster level. These skeletons count toward the number of Hit Dice of undead you can have in your control (2 HD worth per caster level, as with the animate dead spell). Unlike the animate dead spell, these skeletons try to remain within 60 feet of you. If this distance is exceeded, a skeleton becomes inert until you return to within 60 feet of it. Material Component: One fingerbone from a Medium-size creature and one onyx gem worth 50 gp per skeleton to be created. The skeleton that forms from the fingerbone is that type of creature.
Sonorous Hum		KEY:Sonorous Hum					SOURCEPAGE:p.69	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Sonic	CLASSES:Bard=2|Cleric=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=3	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 minute/level (D)	DESC:After you cast this spell, the next spell you cast within the duration that requires concentration to maintain is maintained for you until the sonorous hum spell expires. This effect allows you to cast other spells, even another spell that also requires concentration. If the spell maintained by the sonorous hum has a shorter duration than that of this spell, the maintained spell expires as it normally would and you gain no further benefits from this casting of sonorous hum. The sound created by the spell is as loud as a person in armor walking at a slow pace trying not to make noise (normally a DC 5 Listen check to detect). You may end the sonorous hum as a free action. For example, you could cast this spell, then cast detect thoughts, and this spell maintains the concentration on detect thoughts while you cast discern lies and maintain concentration on that spell yourself. You control all aspects of both spells, so you could change the orientation of the detect thoughts effect and select a different target for your discern lies spell in the same round.
Sound Lance			KEY:Sound Lance						SOURCEPAGE:p.70	SCHOOL:Evocation	DESCRIPTOR:Sonic	CLASSES:Cleric=3|Sorcerer,Wizard=3	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:One creature or object	DURATION:Instantaneous	SAVEINFO:Fortitude half	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:Sound lance causes a projectile of intense sonic energy sound to leap unerringly from you to a target within range. The sound does 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level, to a maximum of 10d6. The sound lance strikes unerringly, unless the target has total cover or total concealment. A sound lance cannot penetrate the area of a silence spell.
Speak To Allies		KEY:Speak To Allies					SOURCEPAGE:p.70	SCHOOL:Transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:Language-Dependent	CLASSES:Bard=2|Sorcerer,Wizard=2	TARGETAREA:Any number of allied creatures, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart	DESC:As message, except as noted above and that you and the recipients don't have to mouth the words or whisper, which means that those skilled in reading lips have no opportunity to learn the messages.
Spell Flower		KEY:Spell Flower					SOURCEPAGE:p.70	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=1|Sorcerer,Wizard=1	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round/level	DESC:You are able to hold the charge on one touch spell per forelimb of your body as long as you don't use that limb to cast other spells or touch anything with it. Each touch spell you cast resides in a different forelimb. For the duration of this spell, any touch spells you cast are only discharged if you cast another spell with that forelimb or touch something with that forelimb. For example, a human sorcerer casts this spell, then casts chill touch and holds the charge in his left hand, then casts shocking grasp and holds the charge in his right hand. Because of the spell flower, he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he cast another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he may immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he may make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round (with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons). A marilith spellcaster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could hold the charge on up to six touch spells. She could also use any of her spell-like or supernatural abilities, since those do not interfere with holding the charge. If the spell flower ends, the most recent touch spell cast remains as a held charge and all other held spells dissipate.
Spider Plague		KEY:Spider Plague					SOURCEPAGE:p.70	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	CLASSES:Cleric=8	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 full round	RANGE:Close	TARGETAREA:1d4+1 summoned creatures	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell summons 1d4+1 celestial (NG) or fiendish (NE) Huge monstrous spiders. They appear where you designate and act immediately, on your turn. They attack your opponents to the best of their ability. If you can communicate with the spiders, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. When you use a summoning spell to summon an evil or good creature, it is a spell of that type.
Stalking Spell		KEY:Stalking Spell					SOURCEPAGE:p.71	SCHOOL:Illusion	SUBSCHOOL:Glamer	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=8	DURATION:1 hour/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	DESC:As improved invisibility, except as noted above and that the creature is hidden from hearing and scent as well. The subject radiates silence to a radius of 5 feet and neither leaves a scent nor can be detected by the scent ability.
Stone Body			KEY:Stone Body						SOURCEPAGE:p.71	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:You	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	DESC:This spell transforms your body into living stone. You gain damage reduction 10/. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from cold and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect stone golems. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a -4 penalty to Dexterity as well (to a minimum Dexterity score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50%% and a -8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attacks deal 1d6 points of normal damage, and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks (a Small caster deals 1d4 points of damage, not 1d6). If your natural attacks already deal more than 1d6 points of damage, use the greater value. Your weight increases by a factor of three, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the oceanat least until the spell expires. Material Component: A small piece of stone that was once part of either a stone golem, a greater earth elemental, or a castle.
Superior Resistance	KEY:Superior Resistance				SOURCEPAGE:p.71	SCHOOL:Abjuration	CLASSES:Bard=5|Cleric=5|Druid=5|Sorcerer,Wizard=5	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:1 hour/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:You imbue the subject with a powerful magical energy that protects him from harm, granting a +6 resistance bonus on saves. Arcane Material Component: A miniature cloak of fine cloth.
Undead Mask			KEY:Undead Mask						SOURCEPAGE:p.71	SCHOOL:Necromancy	DESCRIPTOR:Evil	CLASSES:Cleric=7	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:Creature touched	DURATION:10 minutes/level	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You imbue the subject with powerful transformative magic, granting it some of the characteristics of the undead type. The subject's flesh seems necrotic and rotting, much like that of a zombie. Nonintelligent undead ignore the subject unless the subject attacks the undead. Any spell or effect that affects undead also affects the subject. The subject can be turned, destroyed, rebuked, or commanded as an undead of its Hit Dice (and gets no saving throw to resist the result). Negative energy effects (such as inflict spells) heal the subject, while positive energy effects (such as cure spells) harm her. An undead creature is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. It is immune to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. The subject loses its Constitution score while the spell is in effect, along with any bonus hit points from Constitution. The subject is immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect also works on objects. An undead spellcaster uses its Charisma modifier when making Concentration checks. The subject's other ability scores are unaffected. The subject retains its skills and feats. Material Component: A pinch of vampire dust.
Vile Death			KEY:Vile Death						SOURCEPAGE:p.71	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Calling	DESCRIPTOR:Evil	CLASSES:Cleric=9|Sorcerer,Wizard=9	COMPS:V, S, M/DF	CASTTIME:1 hour	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:One corporeal undead creature	DURATION:Permanent (D)	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:You summon the spirit of a fiend from the depths of Hell or the Abyss and bind it into the body of a corporeal undead creature. Both the undead creature and the fiend get a Will saving throw to negate the effects of vile death. Some fiends may voluntarily fail the save if you swear to dismiss the effect after a certain task or an amount of time. Similarly, some undead may voluntarily fail the save in order to gain the fiend's power, even temporarily. Binding the fiend applies the fiendish template from the Monster Manual to the undead creature. The resulting creature is independent of you, and may act on its own, and its initial attitude toward you is indifferent. Arcane Material Component: A bit of brimstone.
Vipergout			KEY:Vipergout						SOURCEPAGE:p.72	SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Summoning	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=7	COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Personal	TARGETAREA:1d4+3 summoned creatures	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No	DESC:This spell summons 1d4+3 fiendish (CE) or celestial (CG) Medium-size vipers (snakes), which leap forth from your location to attack your enemies. If you can communicate with the vipers, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. When you use a summoning spell to summon an evil or good creature, it is a spell of that type. Material Component: A snakeskin.
Wall Of Limbs		KEY:Wall Of Limbs					SOURCEPAGE:p.72	SCHOOL:Evocation	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=5	COMPS:V, S	CASTTIME:1 full round	RANGE:Medium	TARGETAREA:Wall of whirling limbs up to 20 ft. long/caster level, or a ring of whirling limbs with a radius of up to 5 ft./two caster levels, either form 20 ft. high	DURATION:1 round/level (D)	SAVEINFO:Reflex half or Reflex negates (see text)	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling limbs springs into existence. The limbs resemble your own forelimbs. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save. The wall of limbs provides one-half cover (+4 AC, +2 Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.
Weapon Of Energy		KEY:Weapon Of Energy					SOURCEPAGE:p.72	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=4|Sorcerer,Wizard=4	COMPS:V, S, DF	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Person	TARGETAREA:One weapon	DURATION:1 round/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude (object, harmless)	SPELLRES:None	DESC:You cause a weapon to gain the ability to deal energy damage in addition to its other abilities, similar to how a flaming burst weapon deals extra fire damage on a hit or critical hit. The weapon can deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, chosen by you at the time of casting. The weapon deals +1d6 damage of that energy type on a successful hit. On a critical hit, the weapon deals an additional +1d10 points of energy damage. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add +2d10 points of energy damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add +3d10 points of bonus energy damage. This spell can be cast on a weapon that already deals energy damage, but if the weapon already creates the same type of damage as the spell, the effects do not stack. For example, if cast on a +1 flaming longsword to give it additional fire damage, the spell has no effect, but it can give the weapon any of the other types of energy damage. This spell has a subtype that is the same as the energy created by the target weapon. For example, weapon of energy is a fire spell when used to give a weapon bonus fire damage.
Wings Of The Sea		KEY:Wings Of The Sea					SOURCEPAGE:p.72	SCHOOL:Transmutation	CLASSES:Cleric=2|Druid=1|Ranger=1|Sorcerer,Wizard=2	COMPS:S, M	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch	TARGETAREA:You or person touched	DURATION:1 minute/level	SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates (harmless)	SPELLRES:Yes (harmless)	DESC:This spell increases the touched creature's swim speed by 30 feet. It has no effect on other modes of movement, nor does it give the subject a swim speed if it does not already have one. Material Component: A drop of water.
