Summon Swarm	KEY:Master of Flies ~ Summon Swarm			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	DESC:A master of flies can use summon swarm as a sorcerer of her character level. She can use this ability once per day per level she has attained in this prestige class. The creatures summoned must be vermin; roll 1d20 on the following table. d20 Swarm Type	DESC:&nl;1-6 Spiders (vermin, poisonous)	DESC:&nl;7-13 Centipedes (vermin, poisonous)	DESC:&nl;14-20 Flying beetles (vermin)
Swarm Shape		KEY:Master of Flies ~ Swarm Shape			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a master of flies can take the form of a swarm of vicious little vermin and return to her own form. This effect is similar to that of a summon swarm spell, except that the swarm is of the same size category as the caster (and it has the same face statistic as the caster). The master of flies can choose the type of vermin from the table above. In swarm shape, she can move at a speed of 15 feet, or up to 45 feet if the swarm flies (poor maneuverability). The swarm has the same number of hit points as the original creature and can be damaged by fire and area-effect spells and abilities. If the swarm is dispersed (by gust of wind, for example), the master of flies must return to her own shape. To do so, the dispersed creatures must first coalesce (at the swarm's speed); the master of flies must take a standard action on the following round to transform. A master of flies can use this ability once per day at 2nd level and more times per day at 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 9th level, as shown on Table 7 3: The Master of Flies. At 5th level, a master of flies is able to take the shape of a swarm identical to that produced by an insect plague spell, except that the swarm can be no more than one size larger than the master of flies (you can choose the face if more than one is available). This swarm can move at half the master of flies' normal speed and can fly at the same speed (clumsy maneuverability). At 8th level, a master of flies is able to take the shape of a swarm identical to that produced by a creeping doom spell, except that the swarm can be no more than two size categories larger than the master of flies (you can choose the face statistic if more than one is possible). This mass of vermin can only move at 10 feet per round and cannot fly. In all other respects, the swarm shape ability is identical to the druid's wild shape ability (see Chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook).
Pied Piper		KEY:Master of Flies ~ Pied Piper			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 3rd level, a master of flies is able to influence vermin to a limited extent. She can use this ability once per day per level in this prestige class to charm a number of Hit Dice of vermin equal to or less than her character level, starting with the lowest Hit Dice vermin within range and moving up in Hit Dice until the limit is reached. The range of this effect is 10 feet x the master of flies' level. The vermin are allowed Will saves against this effect (DC 14 + Cha modifier), and any that make their save cannot be affected again by the pied piper ability of that master of files for one day. Charmed vermin move toward the master of flies at their land speed, taking the most direct path available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, the creatures get another saving throw. Charmed vermin can take no actions other than to defend themselves. If the master of flies moves, the charmed vermin follow. This effect lasts for as long as the master of flies concentrates. Once concentration is broken, those vermin cannot be affected again by the pied piper ability of that master of flies for one day.
Insect Plague	KEY:Master of Flies ~ Insect Plague			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality		SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:Beginning at 5th level, a master of flies can use the spell-like ability insect plague as a sorcerer of her class level. She can use this ability once per day per level in this prestige class.
Flyblown		KEY:Master of Flies ~ Flyblown			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 7th level, a master of flies can shift to a swarm shape and back as a free action.
Creeping Doom	KEY:Master of Flies ~ Creeping Doom			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality		SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a master of flies can use the spell-like ability creeping doom as a sorcerer of her class level. She can use this ability once per day per level in this prestige class.
Awaken Vermin	KEY:Master of Flies ~ Awaken Vermin			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality		SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 9th level, a master of flies gains the ability to awaken humanlike sentience in a vermin. She can use this ability once per week. This ability is identical to the 5thlevel druid spell awaken, except that only vermin can be affected and there is no XP cost.
Swarm Leap		KEY:Master of Flies ~ Swarm Leap			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Master of Flies Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 10th level, a master of flies becomes completely attuned to the throb and hum of vermin swarms, gaining the supernatural ability to instantaneously transport herself over great distances through that medium. Once per day as a standard action, she can enter any swarm of mundane vermin whose size equals or exceeds her own and travel to another such swarm in a single round, regardless of distance. The master of flies merely designates a distance and direction ("a swarm 50 miles south of here"), and the swarm leap ability transports her to a destination swarm as close as possible to the desired location. She can attempt to name a specific swarm ("a beehive in an apiary just outside the city of Greyhawk"), but if no such target exists, the ability fails and the master of flies is ejected from the entry swarm. Both the entry swarm and the destination swarm must be alive, but they can be either naturally occurring or summoned. A master of flies in swarm shape cannot use herself as the entry point, but she could enter through an insect plague she created in a previous round. She could even use another master of flies in swarm shape as the entry or destination swarm. When exiting a swarm, the master of flies must choose an adjacent 5-foot-by-5-foot space in which to appear (or a correspondingly larger space if it is larger than Medium-size). Except as noted here, this ability functions like the 6thlevel druid spell transport via plants.

In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top and up to 50 feet tall. The djinni controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet. A djinni's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the djinni enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the djinni moves into or through the creature's space. Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the djinni might take damage when caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 20 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A creature with a fly speed is allowed a DC 20 Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racial adjustment. Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the djinni carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The djinni can have only as many trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume. The djinni can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be.  If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the djinni and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. A djinni in whirlwind form cannot make melee attacks and does not threaten the area around it.

Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles [5d%%] from your intended destination. Note: Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.

Holding you at bay like this requires your opponent to take a standard action. You are also unable to cross running water, though you can be carried over it while resting in your coffin, or aboard a ship. You are utterly unable to enter a home or other building unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. You may freely enter public places.	CATEGORY:Special Ability
