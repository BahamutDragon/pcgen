Area Attack									SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can wield improvised weapons to attack several spaces at once.	PRETEXT:Str 19, Huge size, Power Attack.	PRESTAT:1,STR=19	PRESIZEGTEQ:H	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack	BENEFIT:You can use your great size and strength to pick up a heavy object and attack an area as a standard action. Such an attack may consist of swinging a large log or smashing a door down on opponents' heads. The area affected is a half-circle with a radius equal to your reach. You deal damage to all creatures two or more size categories smaller than you within the area. The base damage dealt depends on your size category, as given on the table below. Add 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack. Size Category Damage Huge 1d8 Gargantuan 2d6 Colossal 2d8 Though it can deal significant damage, this form of attack is awkward and unbalancing. You incur a -2 penalty to your Armor Class and on Reflex saves until your next action.
Assume Supernatural Ability									SOURCEPAGE:p.30	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You learn to use a supernatural ability of an assumed form.	PRETEXT:Wis 13, ability to assume a new form magically.	PRESTAT:1,WIS=13	BENEFIT:You learn to use a single supernatural ability of another kind of creature while assuming its form through a polymorph self spell or a similar effect. The saving throw DC against this ability is based on your ability scores, not those of a standard creature of the kind whose form you've assumed. For a breath weapon, the saving throw DC is 10 + your Constitution modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice (rounded down). For all other supernatural abilities, the saving throw (if any) DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice (rounded down). If a creature, such as an undead, has no Constitution score, use its Charisma modifier or its Constitution modifier (+0 for a nonability), whichever is higher, to determine the save DC. Using this alien ability is disorienting. You take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Additionally, in a stressful or demanding situation (such as combat), you must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or be unable to use the ability. Normal:Without this feat, you cannot use the supernatural abilities of a creature whose form you assume. Special: You can take this feat multiple times. You cannot apply it more than once to the same special ability in order to improve the Will save DC. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different special ability.
Blowhard									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can blow targets over with your breath.	PRETEXT:Con 20, Huge size, Power Attack.	PRESTAT:1,CON=20	PRESIZEGTEQ:H	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack	BENEFIT:As an attack action, you can use your breath to affect all creatures in a cone 5 feet in length per point of your Constitution bonus. Each creature in the area is affected as through struck by a wind effect (see Table 3-17: Wind Effects in the DUNGEONMASTER's Guide). The strength of the wind effect depends on your size category, as given on the table below. Size Category Wind Effect Huge Strong Gargantuan Severe Colossal Windstorm If you have a breath weapon, you cannot use this feat and your breath weapon at the same time.
Bonus Breath									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can use your breath weapon one more time per day than you normally could.	PRETEXT:Breath weapon with limited uses per day, Extend Spell or Extend Spell-Like Ability.	BENEFIT:You can breathe one additional time per day. The interval you must wait between breaths is 1 hour. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you can breathe one additional time per day.
Controlled Respiration									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can stay out of water longer than you otherwise could.	PRETEXT:Time limit on how long you can remain out of water, Endurance.	BENEFIT:You can control your breathing so as to remain out of water for a longer period of time than you otherwise could. Double the normal time limit after which you must begin making Constitution checks to avoid suffocation. This feat does not allow creatures that cannot normally breathe air, such as fish, to do so.
Crush									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Like a dragon, you can hurl your body onto opponents to deal tremendous damage.	PRETEXT:Huge size.	PRESIZEGTEQ:H	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can jump or fall onto opponents, using your whole body to crush them. This attack is useful only against creatures at least three size categories smaller than yourself. The base damage for a crush attack depends on your size category, as given on the table above. Add 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus to this base damage to determine the total damage for the attack. A crush attack deals bludgeoning damage and affects as many creatures as can fit under your body (see Large and Small Creatures in Combat in Chapter 8 of the Player 's Handbook). Each creature in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + your Str modifier + your size modifier for grapple attacks). On a failure, the opponent is pinned and automatically takes crush damage each round the pin is maintained. Size Category Crush Base Damage Huge 2d8 Gargantuan 4d6 Colossal 4d8
Cumbrous Dodge									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a chance to dodge attacks that hit you, but at a cost.	PRETEXT:Dodge, Tumble 4 ranks.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge	PRESKILL:1,Tumble=4	BENEFIT:You may activate this feat as a free action. You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class for the rest of the current encounter. At the end of the encounter, you are fatigued. For details on fatigue, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide.
Cumbrous Fortitude									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a greater chance than normal to resist attacks against your vitality, but at a cost.	PRETEXT:Great Fortitude.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Great Fortitude	BENEFIT:Before rolling a Fortitude save, you can decide to activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the result, you are staggered until the end of the encounter. A staggered character can take only a partial action when he or she would normally be able to take a standard action.
Cumbrous Reflexes									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a greater chance to resist attacks against your agility, but at a cost.	PRETEXT:Lightning Reflexes.	PRESTAT:1,Lightning Reflexes	BENEFIT:Before rolling a Reflex save, you can decide to activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the result, you are prone and dazed. For details on these conditions, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide.
Cumbrous Will									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have a greater chance to resist attacks against your willpower, but at a cost.	PRETEXT:Iron Will.	PRESTAT:1,Iron Will	BENEFIT:Before rolling a Will save, you can decide to activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the result, you are shaken until the end of the encounter. A shaken character takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saving throws.
###prexxx Incomplete Below This Point
Deadly Poison									SOURCEPAGE:p.31	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your poison attack deals more damage than normal.	PRETEXT:Con 19, poison special attack that deals ability damage as secondary damage, Virulent Poison.	BENEFIT:Your poison attack has the potential to deal more potent secondary damage than it otherwise could. If the subject of the attack fails the second saving throw, the poison deals double its normal secondary damage.
Deep Denizen									SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adapted to a subterranean environment.	PRETEXT:Underground as sole terrain type.	BENEFIT:Living underground has made you more reliant on nonvisual senses than surface dwellers. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Listen checks and a +4 competence bonus when tracking by scent.
Desert Dweller									SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adapted to a desert environment.	PRETEXT:Desert terrain type.	BENEFIT:As a desert dweller, you are more hardy than those who live in more gentle climates. Your Fortitude save DC to avoid subdual damage from heat is reduced to 10 (see Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide). In addition, you can go without water for a number of hours equal to 24 + twice your Constitution score (see Starvation and Thirst Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide).
Detach									SOURCEPAGE:p.32	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can remove a part of your body and use it as a ranged weapon.	PRETEXT:Con 19, regeneration.	BENEFIT:As an attack action, you can detach a portion of your body that can make a melee attack other than a bite (such as a paw, tail, or tentacle) and use it as a thrown weapon (range increment 20 feet). The thrown member deals its base damage plus your Strength bonus (not 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus). Special attacks that deal damage, such as poison and acid, take effect normally from the thrown member. Ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain attacks cannot be made with the detached body part. Special: Tearing off a piece of yourself is traumatic. You take subdual damage equal to one-quarter of your full normal hit point total. Damage reduction cannot reduce the amount of damage taken in this way.
Dust Cloud									SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can sweep dust into the air to hide from opponents.	PRETEXT:Dex 19, Int 19, Huge size, Combat Reflexes, wings or tail.	BENEFIT:As an attack action, you can sweep a limb across the ground and create a dust cloud. This hemispherical cloud has a radius in feet equal to 20 × your Hit Dice. Creating the cloud has a 50% chance to snuff unprotected flames (candles, torches, small campfires) of nonmagical origin in the area. The cloud obscures vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for 1 round after emerging. Any creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Str modifier) to cast a spell. The cloud lasts a number of rounds equal to 1 + your Dexterity modifier. Special: A flying creature with this feat must be within reach of the ground to create the effect, but need not actually be in contact with it.
Empower Spell-Like Ability									SOURCEPAGE:p.33	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can use a spell-like ability with greater effect than normal.	PRETEXT:Spell-like ability caster level 4th.	BENEFIT:Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. You can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When you use an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by one-half. An empowered spel-like ability does half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so on as appropriate. For example, a night hag's empowered magic missile deals 1 1/2 times normal damage (roll 1d4+1 and multiply the result by 1 1/2 for each missile). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to one-half yourcaster level (round down), -2. See the table below. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 13th-level caster can only empower spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 4th level or lower. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to another one of your spell-like abilites.
Extended Reach									SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your flexible body allows you to reach farther than normal.	PRETEXT:Small or larger size, nonrigid body or a nonrigid attack form such as a tentacle, feeler, or pseudopod.	BENEFIT:Your body or a part of your body with which you can deliver a melee attack is boneless and flexible, allowing you to threaten a larger than normal area with melee attacks. Add +5 feet to your normal reach.
Extra Item Space									SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can wear more magic items than are normally allowed.	PRETEXT:Multiple limbs or heads.	BENEFIT:You can wear one additional magic item beyond the normal limit for the item type in question. The multiple limbs you have must correspond to the limb on which that item type is normally worn. For example, a character is normally limited to two rings, but a marilith (with six arms) could wear three rings with this feat. Likewise, an ettin (with two heads) could wear two periapts or necklaces instead of the one normally allowed. Normal: Usually only one or two magic items that are restricted to a particular body part can be used at once. Special: You can take this feat more than once. Each time, it adds a new item space. You cannot have more item spaces than you have limbs or body parts of the appropriate kind.
Final Strike									SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your death throes are destructive.	PRETEXT:Acid, air, cold, earth, electricity, fire, or water subtype.	BENEFIT:When you are killed (that is, when your hit points drop to -10 or lower), your body explodes in a final strike—a blast of elemental destruction—according to the table below. Everything within 60 feet is subject to the effect. Your final strike deals 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die, up to a maximum of 20d6. Each creature in the area may make a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modifier) to halve the damage dealt. The blast also has a secondary effect, which can be reduced or negated (as shown on the table below) by a second successful save of the type indicated (same DC_as the save against the primary damage). Subtype Primary Damage Secondary Damage Acid Acid Blindness for 2d4 rounds, Fortitude negates Air Blast of wind Destructive harmonics (bludgeoning damage) (1d6 sonic damage per 2 Hit Dice; Reflex half) Cold Cold Ice shards (1d6 piercing damage per 2 Hit Dice; Reflex half) Earth Blast of rock shards Earthquake (as spell, Reflex save according to effect) Electricity Lightning Thunderclap (1d6 sonic damage per 2 Hit Dice, stun for 1 round, deafen for 4d6 rounds; Reflex half and no deafness) Fire Fire Light blast (1d6 damage per 2 Hit Dice; Reflex half) Water Blast of water Drench (extinguish (bludgeoning damage) nonmagical fire automatically, or magical fire as dispel magic cast by a sorcerer whose level equals your HD total) Special: A final strike renders your corpse unsuitable for raise dead or resurrection spells. Only true resurrection, miracle, or wish can restore life.
Fling Enemy									SOURCEPAGE:p.34	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can pick up an opponent and fling it.	PRETEXT:Str 23, Huge size, improved grab.	BENEFIT:You can make a grapple check at a -20 penalty against an opponent at least two size categories smaller than you. If you succeed, on your next action you can use an attack action to fling the held opponent. The range increment for the thrown creature is 120 feet. A creature may be thrown horizontally or vertically. If thrown vertically, it takes normal falling damage. If thrown horizontally, it takes damage as if it had fallen half the distance thrown (rounded down). For example, if a hurled orc is thrown horizontally 170 feet, it takes 8d6 points of damage. You may also fling the creature at another creature. To do so, make an attack roll at a -4 penalty, with appropriate range penalties, against the target creature. If you hit, both creatures take the amount of damage that the thrown creature would have taken otherwise, as given above.
Gape Of The Serpent									SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can swallow larger creatures than normal.	PRETEXT:Swallow whole.	BENEFIT:You can swallow a creature of up to your own size category. Like a snake, you can stretch your mouth to an outlandish extent to accommodate immense prey. However, this process is time-consuming. If your second grapple check is successful after you have established a hold against a creature larger than you could swallow normally, you begin to swallow the held creature. On the following round, you must make an additional grapple check to complete the swallowing. The held creature can fight or try to break the grapple as normal while you are attempting to swallow it. Normal: Unless otherwise noted, a creature can swallow opponents no larger than two size categories smaller than itself. Special: Your gullet can hold one creature of the maximum size; other maximum numbers of swallowed creatures remain the same.
Grass Trekker									SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adapted to a plains environment.	PRETEXT:Plains terrain type.	BENEFIT:You are a nomad of the steppes, used to traveling long distances, often on foot. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Jump checks. In addition, you do not need to make Fortitude saves when making a forced march until you have traveled for 12 hours (see Movement in Chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook). The save DC for longer travel is 10 + 1 per hour beyond 12.
Great Flyby Attack									SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can make multiple flyby attacks in a round.	PRETEXT:Fly speed, Flyby Attack.	BENEFIT:Using this feat is a full-round action. When flying, you can move up to your fly speed in a straight line and attack a number of opponents equal to your Dexterity bonus. All targets must be within your reach along the line of your movement. Make one attack roll, add the appropriate modifiers, and compare the result to the AC of each opponent you are attacking. If any hits are successful, make one damage roll and add the appropriate modifiers. Each successful hit does the full damage to that creature; do not divide the result of the damage roll among the targets. Targets of your attack do not get attacks of opportunity against you, but other opponents that would be entitled to attacks of opportunity may take them. Normal: Without this feat, a creature can make a single flyby attack in a round.
Greater Multigrab									SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can grapple enemies effortlessly with your natural weapons.	PRETEXT:Str 19, Dex 15, improved grab, Multigrab.	BENEFIT:When grappling an opponent with only the part of your body that made the attack, you take no penalty on grapple checks to maintain the hold. Normal: Without this feat, you take a -20 penalty (or a -10 penalty with Multigrab) on grapple checks to maintain a hold with only the part of your body used to make the attack.
Greater Multiweapon Fighting									SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:A creature with three or more arms can fight with a weapon in each hand. The creature can make up to three attacks per round with each extra weapon.	PRETEXT:Dex 19, three arms, base attack bonus +15, Improved Multiweapon Fighting, Multiweapon Fighting, Multidexterity.	BENEFIT:You may make up to three attacks with each offhand weapon that you wield, albeit with a -10 penalty on the third attack with each such weapon. Special: This feat replaces the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat (originally presented in Masters of the Wild) for creatures with more than two arms.
Greater Mighty Roar									SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You unsettle opponents with a dreadful roar as you attack.	PRETEXT:Animal or magical beast; Large size, Mighty Roar.	BENEFIT:This feat functions like Mighty Roar, except that each opponent that fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Cha modifier) is panicked for 2d6 rounds. A panicked creature takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks, has a 50% chance to drop what it is holding, and runs away from you as quickly as it can. The effects of being panicked supersede the effects of being shaken.
Improved Assume Supernatural Ability									SOURCEPAGE:p.35	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You gain skill with using a supernatural ability of an assumed form.	PRETEXT:Wis 17, Assume Supernatural Ability, ability to assume a new form magically.	BENEFIT:This feat functions like Assume Supernatural Ability, except that you do not take the -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks when using it. Special: You can take this feat multiple times, but you cannot apply it more than once to the same special ability. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different special ability.
Improved Flyby Attack									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can attack on the wing with increased mobility.	PRETEXT:Fly speed, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Mobility.	BENEFIT:When flying, you can take a move action (including a dive) and another partial action at any point during the move. If this partial action is an attack, you incur no attacks of opportunity for moving through areas threatened by your target. You cannot take a second move action during a round when you make a flyby attack. Normal: Without this feat, you can take a partial action either before or after your move. Even with the Flyby Attack feat, you incur attacks of opportunity for moving through areas threatened by the target of your flyby attack.
Improved Multiattack									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You are particularly adept at using all your natural weapons at once.	PRETEXT:Three natural weapons, Multiattack.	BENEFIT:The usual -5 penalty on attack rolls for secondary attacks does not apply to your secondary attacks with natural weapons. The damage bonus for such attacks is still only 1/2 your Strength bonus, if any. Normal: Without this feat, your secondary natural attacks take a -5 penalty (or a -2 penalty if you have the Multiattack feat).
Improved Multiweapon Fighting									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You are expert at fighting with a weapon in each of your three or more hands. You can make up to two attacks per round with each off-hand weapon.	PRETEXT:Dex 15, three arms, base attack bonus +9, Multidexterity, Multiweapon Fighting.	BENEFIT:In addition to the single extra attack you get each round with each off-hand weapon from Multiweapon Fighting, you get a second extra attack with each such weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty. Normal: With only Multiweapon Fighting, you get only a single attack with each off-hand weapon. Special: This feat replaces the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.
# Prexxx Complete Below This Point
Improved Scent									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can detect and track creatures by smell at greater distances than normal.	PRETEXT:Scent ability.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Scent	BENEFIT:You can detect approaching enemies and sniff out hidden foes within 60 feet. For strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, double these ranges. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. Normal: Without this feat, you can detect creatures by smell only within 30 feet.
Improved Turn Resistance									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You have a better than normal chance to resist turning.	PRETEXT:Undead.	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Undead	BENEFIT:You are less easily affected by clerics or paladins than you normally would be (see Turn and Rebuke Undead in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook). When resolving a turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add 4 to your character level (monster Hit Dice plus class levels) to determine your Hit Dice for turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts. For example, a 4 HD wight with this feat is treated as an 8 HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command, and bolster attempts, even though it is a 4 HD creature for any other purpose.
Improved Web									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You gain additional utility from your webs.	PRETEXT:Ability to create webs as an extraordinary ability at least twice per day.	BENEFIT:Add +2 to the DC to escape or burst your webs. You may take a full-round action to attack with your webs, and if you do so, you may attack one additional target per point of Dexterity bonus you have. No such target may be more than 10 feet from another target. Using this feat requires two of the daily uses of your web ability.
Inured To Energy									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can resist energy attacks more efficiently than normal.	PRETEXT:Resistance to the energy type you specify when taking the feat.	BENEFIT:Your existing resistance to one type of energy increases by 10. You can use this feat only to enhance existing resistances, not to gain resistance to a new type of energy. For example, a demon can increase its resistance to acid, cold, or fire, but it cannot gain sonic resistance with this feat. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack. Each time you take the feat, you can either apply it to another type of energy to which you already have resistance, or increase an existing resistance.
Involuntary Rage									SOURCEPAGE:p.36	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Extreme pain drives you berserk.	PRETEXT:Con 20, Toughness.	PRESTAT:1,CON=20	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Toughness	BENEFIT:If you survive 50 points of damage from a single attack and make your Fortitude save (see Massive Damage in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook), on your next action you gain +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and -2 to Armor Class. These adjustments last until the end of the combat, at which time you become fatigued. For details on being fatigued, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide.
Irresistible Gaze									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your gaze attack is more potent than normal.	PRETEXT:Gaze attack.	BENEFIT:Add +2 to the DC of all saving throws against your gaze attack. Special: The benefit of this feat stacks with the benefit provided by the Ability Focus feat (see above).
Mighty Leaping									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You have developed your leg muscles and trained yourself to make mighty leaps.	PRETEXT:Str 21, Dodge, Mobility, Jump 9 ranks or a racial bonus on Jump checks.	PRESTAT:1,STR=21	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dodge,Mobility	PREMULT:1,[PRESKILL:1,Jump=9],[PRETEXT:Jump racial]	BENEFIT:You gain a +10 competence bonus on Jump checks. If you intentionally jump down from a height, a successful Jump check (DC 15) lets you take damage as if you had fallen 20 feet less than you actually did. Normal: Without this feat, a successful Jump check lets you take damage as if you had fallen 10 feet less than you actually did. Special: A creature with this feat is not limited by its height when jumping.
Mighty Roar									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You unsettle opponents with a dreadful roar as you attack.	PRETEXT:Animal or magical beast; Large size.	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Animal,RACETYPE=Magical Beast	PRESIZEGTEQ:L	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can use this feat as a standard action. Your mighty roar affects every opponent within 30 feet of you that can hear your roar and has a character level lower than yours. An affected opponent must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Cha modifier) to negate the effect. Failure means that opponent becomes shaken for 1d6 rounds. A shaken creature takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saving throws.
Multigrab									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can grapple enemies more firmly than normal with your natural attacks.	PRETEXT:Str 17, improved grab.	PRESTAT:1,STR=17	BENEFIT:When grappling an opponent with the part of your body that made the attack, you take only a -10 penalty on grapple checks to maintain the hold. Normal: Without this feat, you take a -20 penalty on grapple checks to maintain a hold with the part of your body used to make the attack.
Multitasking									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can perform different tasks with different limbs.	PRETEXT:Dex 15, Int 15, four or more arms, Improved Multiweapon Fighting, Multiattack, Multiweapon Fighting.	BENEFIT:If you have four or more arms, you can use each pair of arms to perform a distinct partial action. All such partial actions occur simultaneously. Thus, you could attack with one or two arms while using a magic item, reloading a crossbow, or casting a spell with two other arms.	PRESTAT:2,DEX=15,INT=15	PREHANDSGTEQ:4	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Multiweapon Fighting,Multiattack,Multiweapon Fighting
Multivoice									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:If you have two or more heads, you can cast more spells than usual in a round.	PRETEXT:Dex 15, Int 15, two or more heads, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Multiattack, Quicken Spell, Two-Weapon Fighting.	PRESTAT:2,DEX=15,INT=15	PREVARGTEQ:Heads,2	PREABILITY:4,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Two-Weapon Fighting,Multiattack,Quicken Spell,Two-Weapon Fighting	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can cast one additional spell (or use a spell-like ability in combination with a spell or another spell-like ability) each round. Each spell used in this way must have a casting time of 1 action; a spell-like ability must also take no more than a standard action to use. Using this feat provokes an attack of opportunity. If your concentration is interrupted during this simultaneous casting or spell-like ability use, whether by taking damage or by some other means, a Concentration check is required for each spell or spell-like ability. Failing either Concentration check negates both spells or spelllike abilities. You can also use one head to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while another head activates a head-based special attack, such as a breath weapon or an eye ray. Normal: Without this feat, you can cast only one spell per round and cannot combine spellcasting with other actions. Special: You still cannot exceed the limit of one quickened spell per round (assuming you also have the Quicken Spell feat) when using this feat.
Narrowed Gaze									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your gaze attack has a limited field of effect.	PRETEXT:Int 13, gaze attack.	PRESTAT:1,INT=13	BENEFIT:You may choose to limit your gaze attack to an active gaze. Doing so prevents you from accidentally affecting friends with your gaze. Normal: A gaze attack functions constantly on all those within range, and it can also be used actively as an attack action.
Pain Mastery									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Injuries send you into a fury, increasing your physical power.	PRETEXT:Con 20, Toughness.	PRESTAT:1,CON=20	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Toughness	BENEFIT:You take damage normally, but every 50 points of damage you take (if you survive the attack) automatically increases your Strength by +2. This bonus lasts until the end of the encounter, after which you are exhausted. See the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide for the effects of being exhausted.
Peak Hopper									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adapted to a hilly or mountainous environment.	PRETEXT:Hill or mountain terrain type.	BENEFIT:Your alpine environment has made you more surefooted. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Balance and Climb checks.
Pervasive Gaze									SOURCEPAGE:p.37	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your gaze attack is more effective than normal.	PRETEXT:Int 13, gaze special attack.	PRESTAT:1,INT=13	BENEFIT:A creature that averts its eyes has only a 25% chance to avoid the need for a saving throw against your gaze attack. Normal: A creature that averts its eyes normally has a 50% chance to avoid the need for a saving throw against a gaze attack. Special: This feat does not affect eye rays, such as those of a beholder.
Piercing Gaze									SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your gaze attack has a greater range than normal.	PRETEXT:Cha 15, Int 13, gaze special attack, Irresistible Gaze.	PRESTAT:2,CHA=15,INT=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Irresistible Gaze	BENEFIT:Because of the sheer force of your presence, you add 30 feet to the range of your gaze attack.
Poison Immunity									SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can ignore the effects of poison.	PRETEXT:Poison special attack as an extraordinary ability, Poison Resistance.	BENEFIT:Your poisonous nature grants you immunity to poison attacks.
Poison Resistance									SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can resist poison better than you otherwise could.	PRETEXT:Poison special attack as an extraordinary ability.	BENEFIT:Your poisonous nature grants you a greater than normal ability to withstand poison attacks. You gain a +2 competence bonus on your Fortitude saves to resist the effects of poison. If a creature of the same kind as you produces the poison, this bonus is +4 instead, assuming that you are not already immune to the poison of your own kind.
Power Dive									SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can fall upon an opponent from the sky.	PRETEXT:Str 15, fly speed (average maneuverability).	PRESTAT:1,STR=15	BENEFIT:When flying, you can dive and land on an opponent to deal additional damage. Using this feat is a standard action, and it can affect only creatures one or more size categories smaller than you. To use this feat, make an overrun attack, but the opponent cannot choose to avoid you. If you knock down the target, you may make an additional slam attack (at the usual +4 attack bonus against prone opponents). The attack deals the base damage given on the table below for your size category plus 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus (rounded down). Size Category Power Dive Base Damage Fine 1d2 Diminutive 1d3 Tiny 1d4 Medium-size 1d6 Large 1d8 Huge 2d6 Gargantuan 2d8 Colossal 4d6 Normal: Without this feat, you can attack with just one natural weapon and do not have a chance to knock down the opponent. Special: If you fail in your overrun attempt and are tripped in turn, you are knocked down, and you deal the slam damage for the attack to yourself.
Prehensile Tail									SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can use your tail to manipulate objects.	PRETEXT:Str 13, tail attack, Two-Weapon Fighting.	PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Two-Weapon Fighting	BENEFIT:You can use your tail as an extra “hand.” It can grasp melee weapons and use them in combat, although the normal penalties for using an off-hand weapon apply. If you have two hands, your tail counts as a third hand for the purpose of the Multiweapon Fighting feat and all feats that use Multiweapon Fighting as a prerequisite. You can also use your tail as a “hand” to assist in grapple checks and Climb checks. You gain a +2 competence bonus on all such checks.
Quick Change	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									SOURCEPAGE:p.38	DESC:You can shift to an alternate form faster and more easily than you otherwise could.	PRESTAT:1,DEX=15	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Dex 15, alternate form special quality.	BENEFIT:The time it takes for you to change forms is reduced as follows. Normal Reduces to More than one round Half as many rounds, rounded up Full round action Standard action Standard action Move equivalent action Move equivalent action Free action This feat cannot reduce the time it takes to change forms to less than the time required for a free action.
Quicken Spell-Like Ability									SOURCEPAGE:p.38	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can use a spell-like ability with a moment's thought.	PRETEXT:Spell-like ability caster level 8th.	BENEFIT:Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described below. You can use that ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). Quicken Spell-Like Ability Spell Caster Level Level to Quicken 0 8th 1st 10th 2nd 12th 3rd 14th 4th 16th 5th 18th 6th 20th 7th — 8th — 9th — Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You can perform another action—including the use of another spell-like ability—in the same round that you use a quickened spelllike ability. You may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round. You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to one-half your caster level (round down), -4. See the table below. For example, a creature that uses its spell-like abilities as a 15th-level caster can only quicken spell-like abilities duplicating spells of 3rd level or lower. In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened. Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless noted otherwise. Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to another one of your spell-like abilities.
Rapid Breath									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You do not have to wait as long to reuse your breath weapon as you normally would.	PRETEXT:Breath weapon, Quicken Spell or Quicken Spell-Like Ability.	BENEFIT:The required interval between uses of your breath weapon is reduced by 1 round. For instance, a dragon with this feat can use its breath weapon once every 1d4-1 rounds instead of every 1d4 rounds. If the 1d4-1 result is 0, the dragon can breathe again in the following round (but not twice in the same round). If the interval is a fixed period of time, such as once per hour, the interval is halved. Special: If you have multiple heads with breath weapons, all your breath weapons use the new interval.
Rending Constriction									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can pull grappled enemies apart.	PRETEXT:Str 19, Dex 15, constrict ability, improved grab, Greater Multigrab, Multigrab, two constricting limbs.	PRESTAT:2,STR=19,DEX=15	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Improved Grab,Constrict	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Greater Multigrab,Multigrab	BENEFIT:If you maintain a hold with more than one appendage on an opponent and are able to constrict, you can make an additional rend attack in the same round. This attack automatically deals double the base damage for a constrict attack, and the damage bonus is 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus. However, making this rend attack automatically releases the held creature on its next action. You must reestablish the hold to constrict again.
Reverberation									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your sonic attack is more potent than normal.	PRETEXT:Sonic special attack.	BENEFIT:Add +2 to the DC of all saving throws against your sonic attack. Special: If you have more than one form of sonic attack, you can take this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different one of your sonic attacks.
Roll With It									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adept at lessening the effects of blows.	PRETEXT:Con 20, Toughness.	PRESTAT:1,CON=20	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Toughness	BENEFIT:You gain damage reduction 2/-. This applies in addition to any damage reduction you have from other sources. Damage reduction cannot reduce damage you take to less than 0. Special: You may take this feat multiple times.
Scramble									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your slippery ways allow you to evade a damaging blow.	PRETEXT:Dex 15, Small size or smaller, improved evasion.	PRESTAT:1,DEX=15	PRESIZELTEQ:S	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Improved Evasion	BENEFIT:The effects of this feat resemble those of the rogue's defensive roll, but you can use Scramble to avoid a potentially fatal attack entirely. Once per day, when you would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), you can attempt to scramble out of the way. This requires a Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt). If the save is successful, you avoid the damage entirely. You must be aware of the attack and able to react to it; you cannot use Scramble if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Special: Since you cannot normally make a saving throw to avoid the damage from a blow, improved evasion does not apply. That is, you cannot save twice against the same attack.
Stamp									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can stamp the ground to crush and disrupt opponents.	PRETEXT:Huge size, feet, trample special attack.	PRESIZEGTEQ:H	PRELEGSGTEQ:2	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trample	BENEFIT:You may, as a full-round action, strike a solid surface with one of your limbs and create a shock wave that radiates out from your position and continues for a number of feet equal to 5 × your base creature's Hit Dice. Make a single unarmed attack roll. Every creature in the affected area compares its Balance check result to your attack roll result. Those who fail this opposed check are knocked down. Special: Each structure and unattended object that is at least partially within the shock wave takes damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength bonus + the object's hardness (maximum 5).
Supernatural Transformation									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You convert a spell-like ability to a supernatural ability.	PRETEXT:Innate spell-like ability.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.SpellLike	BENEFIT:One of your innate spell-like abilities becomes a supernatural ability. It is no longer subject to spell resistance, though it can still be suppressed in an antimagic field. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The number of uses, if limited, does not change. The effective caster level equals your total Hit Dice or the effective caster level of the original ability, whichever is higher. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take it, it applies to a new spelllike ability.
Surrogate Spellcasting									SOURCEPAGE:p.39	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You use substitute verbal and somatic components when casting spells.	PRETEXT:Wis 13, nonhumanoid or nonhumanlike form.	PRESTAT:1,WIS=13	BENEFIT:You complete the verbal and somatic components of spells by substituting vocalizations and gestures appropriate to your shape. You must still have suitable appendages and vocal organs. For example, a giant eagle could substitute screeches and waves of its talons for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell. You can use any material component or focus that you can hold. This feat does not permit the use of magic items by a creature whose form could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak if you cannot already.
Swamp Stalker									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adapted to a marshy environment.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Marsh terrain.	BENEFIT:You move easily through the sucking bogs and stagnant water of the swamps. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Swim checks and on Strength checks to break free of nets, webs, entangle spells, and similar hindrances. This feat does not grant a bonus on grapple checks.
Thick-Skinned									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your tough hide grants improved damage reduction.	PRETEXT:Damage reduction.	BENEFIT:Your existing damage reduction improves by 2, as indicated on the table below. Existing DR After Thick-Skinned x/silver x+2/silver x/+1 x+2/+1 x/+2 x+2/+2 x/+3 x+2/+3 x/+4 x+2/+4 Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, it improves your damage reduction by 2, up to a maximum of twice your original damage reduction.
Thunderclap									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You create a cone of deafening sound by clapping two limbs together.	PRETEXT:Str 30, Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack.	PRESTAT:1,STR=30	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike,Power Attack	BENEFIT:You may, as a full-round action, clap two of your limbs together and create a cone of sound that starts at your position and continues out for a number of feet equal to 5 × your Hit Dice. A storm giant using this feat creates a cone 95 feet (5 × 19 Hit Dice) long. Creatures in the cone get a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Con modifier) to resist the effect. Those who fail their save are deafened for the duration of the encounter. Those who fail their save by 5 or more are also knocked down. See the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide for the results of being deafened and knocked down. Special: This effect automatically extinguishes unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like).
Treefriend									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adapted to a forest environment.	PRETEXT:Forest terrain.	BENEFIT:You are completely at home in the forest. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost in the forest.
Uncanny Scent									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can pinpoint scents at a greater distance.	PRETEXT:Scent ability, Improved Scent.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Scent	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Scent	BENEFIT:You can pinpoint the location of a scent when within 20 feet. Normal: You can pinpoint the location of a scent when within 5 feet.
Vicious Wound									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Damage you deal causes wounds that bleed excessively.	PRETEXT:Expertise, wounding special attack.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Expertise	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Wounding	BENEFIT:When using an attack that has a wounding special ability, the wounds you cause bleed for an additional +1 point of damage each round. For instance, a hit from a barbazu's glaive causes the victim to bleed for 3 points of damage each round, not 2.
Virulent Poison									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:Your poison attack is more effective.	PRETEXT:Poison attack as an extraordinary ability.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Poison	BENEFIT:Add +2 to the DC for Fortitude saving throws against your poison attack.
Wingstorm									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Monstrous	DESC:You can flatten targets with blasts of air from your wings.	PRETEXT:Str 13, fly speed 20 ft., Large size, Hover, Power Attack.	PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PREMOVE:1,Fly,20	PRESIZEGTEQ:L	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Hover,Power Attack	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can hover in place and use your wings to create a blast of air in a cylinder with a radius and maximum height based on your size. The wind strength also depends on your size, as shown on the table below. Size Wind Effect Radius Max. Height Large Severe 10 feet 40 feet Huge Windstorm 20 feet 80 feet Gargantuan Hurricane 30 feet 100 feet Colossal Tornado 40 feet 120 feet Because the blast of air only lasts for your turn, creatures ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which case they are blown back 1d6×5 feet). Special: You can use this feat for a full round instead of as a full-round action. If you do, the wind lasts until your next turn (and you can choose to continue the effect during your next turn). Anyone in or entering the cylinder is affected. Because you are producing a continuous blast of air, the checked effect works normally while the wind lasts (checked creatures cannot move forward against the force of the wind, or they are blown back 1d6×5 feet if airborne).
Winter's Child									SOURCEPAGE:p.40	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are adapted to a cold environment.	PRETEXT:Cold terrain.	BENEFIT:As an arctic dweller, you are more hardy. The DC of your Fortitude save to avoid subdual damage from cold is reduced to 10 (see Cold Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEONMASTER's Guide). In addition, you can make a saving throw each minute (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) to resist the effects of hypothermia in very cold water.
