###Block: Full Spell Descriptions
# Spell Name					Description
Absorb Weapon.MOD					DESC:The weapon you hold in your hand begins to fade from existence as you complete the spell. With the last words of the spell it disappears completely. At the same moment, a weapon-shaped red blotch appears on your arm. You can harmlessly absorb a weapon you are touching (even a poisoned one) into your arm, as long as it is not in another creature's possession. The weapon must be a light weapon for you at the time you cast the spell. The absorbed weapon cannot be felt under the skin and doesn't restrict your range of motion in any way. An absorbed weapon cannot be detected with even a careful search, although detect magic reveals the presence of a magical aura. The only evidence of its presence is a faint blotch on your skin shaped vaguely like the weapon. When you touch the spot (an action equivalent to drawing a weapon), or when the spell duration expires, the weapon appears in your hand and the spell ends. If you attack with the weapon in the same round that you retrieve it from its hiding place, you can attempt a Bluff check to feint in combat as a free action, and you gain a +4 bonus on the Bluff check. An intelligent magic weapon gets a saving throw against this spell, but other weapons do not.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Absorption.MOD					DESC:As you complete the spell's intricate gestures, you detect a slight buzz at the edge of your hearing. Your body feels warmer, and a feeling of security fills you. Spells and spell-like effects that target you are absorbed, their energy stored to power spells of your own. Absorption absorbs only ranged spells that have you as a target. Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed. Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance to be affected. For example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person cast as a 5th-level spell. Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40%% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. If affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you're struck by disintegrate cast as a 6th-level spell with four levels of absorption remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33%% (1/3) of the damage you would normally take from the spell. You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used). The levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Abyssal Army.MOD					DESC:You complete the spell and a hot fog rises from the ground, coiling round you. Stepping out of the billowing steam comes a handful of squat, blubbery demons. Other, greater silhouettes loom behind them, answering your call. This spell summons a pack of demons from the Infinite Layers of the Abyss to serve you. When the spell is complete, 2d4 dretches (MM 42) appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 babau demons (MM 40) appear. Ten minutes after that, one vrock demon (MM 48) appears. Each creature has maximum hit points per Hit Die. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell. The demons obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the demons. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Accelerated Movement.MOD			DESC:An azure glow surrounds you as you complete the motions that unleash the spell. You immediately feel lighter of foot. While this spell is in effect, you can move at your normal speed when using Balance, Climb, Hide, Move Silently, and Tumble without taking any penalty on your check. This spell does not affect the penalty for using these skills while running or charging. Material Component: A dead cockroach.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Acid Breath.MOD					DESC:You pop the fire ants into your mouth and exhale quickly. The ants distill into drops of pure acid in midair, spattering against your foes and leaving smoking holes. You breathe forth a cone of acidic droplets. The cone deals 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Material Component: A handful of fire ants (alive or dead).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Acid Sheath.MOD					DESC:You crush the fire ants between your fingers and rub the smashed mixture over your exposed flesh. The smashed ants liquefy, and the liquid covers your body in a thick, translucent sheath. You enclose yourself in a fluid sheath of acid that does not harm you. You can breathe normally and cast spells while the acid sheath is present. Any creature striking you deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 2 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 30 points). Reach weapons, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. The acid sheath does not protect you against other attack forms, such as fire. If you are in a grapple, other creatures in the grapple takes acid damage once per round at the beginning of their turn. Any spell you cast with the acid descriptor while the sheath surrounds you deals an extra 1 point of damage per die. Material Component: A handful of fire ants (alive or dead). Focus: A glass sculpture of a humanoid (worth 50 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Acid Storm.MOD					DESC:A dark green cloud whirls into being before unleashing a shower of foul-smelling, yellow-green rain. Acid rain deals 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. Material Component: A flask of acid (10 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aid (Mass).MOD					DESC:You hold your holy symbol aloft and cast the spell. A silvery radiance dances from your hands, leaping over all the nearby party members and strengthening them. This spell functions like aid (PH 196), except that it affects multiple subjects at a distance and each subject gains temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+15).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aiming at the Target.MOD			DESC:As you intone the words of power to release this spell, you feel far more focused on the spell on which you have been concentrating. When you cast this spell, you increase your ability to concentrate on a spell you have already cast. You can cast this spell while maintaining concentration on another spell. Aiming at the target gives you a +10 circumstance bonus on Concentration checks you make to maintain concentration on the other spell, and its effect lasts as long as you concentrate on the other spell (to a maximum of 20 minutes).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Air Breathing.MOD					DESC:Tiny bubbles form on your hands as you complete the spell. As you touch each subject, its chest heaves and shudders, then begins to rhythmically expand and contract. The transmuted creatures can breathe air freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. This spell does not make creatures unable to breathe water. Arcane Material Component: A short reed or piece of straw.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Alarm (Greater).MOD				DESC:Uttering a low chant, you ring a crystal bell with the drumming of your fingernails, bringing into being an invisible warded area. This spell functions like alarm (PH 197), and in addition the spell works on creatures traveling through the area on coterminous or coexistent planes (DMG 150), such the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow. Focus: A bell made of carved crystal, worth at least 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Align Fang.MOD					DESC:You kneel beside your animal companion and press a sprig of mistletoe against its forehead, calling upon the power of nature. Align fang makes a creature's natural weapons good-, evil-, lawful-, or chaotic- aligned, as you choose. A natural weapon that is aligned can overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment. This spell has no effect on a natural weapon that is already treated as being aligned, such as the claw or bite attack of most demons. You can't cast this spell on a manufactured weapon, such as a sword. When you cast this spell to make a natural weapon good-, evil-, lawful-, or chaotic-aligned, align fang is a good, evil, lawful, or chaotic spell, respectively.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Align Fang (Mass).MOD				DESC:You hold a sprig of mistletoe aloft and invoke the powers of nature. Your animal allies glow pale blue at their muzzles and paws. This spell functions like align fang, except that it affects multiple allies at a distance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Align Weapon (Mass).MOD				DESC:You hold your holy symbol high and speak old words of power. Your party's weapons take on a pale blue radiance. This spell functions like align weapon (PH 197), except that it affects multiple weapons or projectiles at a distance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Allegro.MOD						DESC:With a quick wiggle of your fingers and a few arcane words, you release the feather in your hand to complete the spell. Suddenly, translucent blue motes burst outward from you and collect on yourself and your nearby allies before fading away. Each creature within the spell's area gains a 30-foot enhancement bonus to its land speed, up to a maximum of double the creature's land speed. Affected creatures retain these effects for the duration of the spell, even if they leave the original area. Material Component: A tail feather from a bird of prey.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Amanuesis.MOD					DESC:You point at the writing and then move your hand as though holding a stylus or quill. As you intone the spell, the script appears on a sheet of paper close at hand. You cause writing from one source (such as a book) to be copied into a book, paper, or parchment. This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook, a spell scroll, or a sepia snake sigil). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with explosive runes), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied. The spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied. Blank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages. The spell does not translate the copied writing. If you do not understand the original, you have no additional ability to understand the copy.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Amorphous Form.MOD				DESC:You dust your ally with gelatin and silently evoke the spell. Immediately her bones begin to soften and she and her belongings slump, becoming malleable ooze. The subject and all its gear become amorphous and oozelike. This new form is boneless and fluid, enabling the subject to pass through holes or narrow openings as small as 2 inches in diameter. While amorphous, the subject is immune to poison, polymorphing, and stunning, it cannot be flanked, and it is not subject to extra damage from critical hits. It gains a swim speed (if it does not have one already) equal to its land speed. The subject can remain submerged as long as desired without breathing. The subject's armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its modifiers for size, Dexterity, and deflection still apply to Armor Class, as do armor bonuses from force effects (for example, from the mage armor spell). While amorphous, the subject can't attack or cast spells that require verbal, somatic, material, or focus components. (This limitation does not rule out the casting of any spells that the subject might have prepared using the metamagic feats Eschew Materials, Silent Spell, and Still Spell.) The subject loses all supernatural abilities while in amorphous form, and its magic items, aside from those bonuses noted above, cease functioning as long as it remains amorphous. Material Component: A pinch of gelatin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Amplify.MOD						DESC:You need to hear what's going on. A hand motion or two, and the voices become louder to your ears. You cause an amplification of all sounds within the spell's area. This decreases the DC to hear those sounds by 20. Those creatures within the spell's area do not notice the increased amplification. Thus, anyone whose voice is amplified remains unaware of the increase in volume. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can apply spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. Amplify counters and dispels silence, and is also countered and dispelled by silence.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Analyze Portal.MOD				DESC:Seeing with a magic eye, you sense the portal. Studying it, knowledge about the portal comes into your mind as though it was a memory you could not recall until now. You can tell whether an area contains a magical portal or the effect of a gate spell. If you study an area for 1 round, you know the sizes and locations of any such portals in the area. Once you find a portal, you can study it. (If you find more than one portal, you can study only one at a time.) Each round you study a portal, you can discover one property of the portal, in this order. . Any key or command word needed to activate the portal. . Any special circumstances governing the portal's use (such as specific times when it can be activated). . Whether the portal is one-way or two-way. . A glimpse of the area where the portal leads. You can look at the area where the portal leads for 1 round; the range of your vision is the spell's range. Analyze portal does not allow other divination spells or spell-like abilities to extend through the portal. For example, you cannot also use detect magic or detect evil to study the area where the portal leads while viewing the area with analyze portal. For each property, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 17. If fail, you can try again in the next round. Analyze portal has only a limited ability to reveal unusual properties, as follows. . Random Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is random and whether it can be activated now. It does not reveal when the portal starts or stops functioning. . Variable Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is variable. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals only the destination to which the portal is currently set. . Creature-Only Portals: The spell reveals this property. If you study the portal's destination, the spell reveals where the portal sends creatures. If it is the kind of portal that sends creatures to one place and their equipment to another place, the spell does not reveal where the equipment goes. . Malfunctioning Portals: The spell reveals only that the portal is malfunctioning, not what sort of malfunction the portal produces. Material Components: A crystal lens and a small mirror.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anarchic Storm.MOD				DESC:You call upon the powers of chaos, and a heavy rain begins to fall around you, its drops a rainbow of soft radiances. Above you, a multicolored lightning bolt flashes. The downpour created by this spell falls in a fixed area once created. The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks. It also applies a -4 penalty on ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm. Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50%% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns). The rain damages lawful creatures, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round (lawful outsiders take double damage). In addition, each round, a bolt of lightning strikes a randomly selected lawful outsider within the spell's area, dealing 5d6 points of electricity damage. After the spell's duration expires, the water disappears. Material Component: A flask of anarchic water (see the anarchic water spell, below).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anarchic Water.MOD				DESC:You speak the ancient, slippery words as you pour the iron and silver into the flask. Despite the fact that there is more powder than room in the bottle, all of it dissolves, leaving a flask of water swirling with motes of gold. This transmutation imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with the energy of chaos, turning it into anarchic water. Anarchic water damages lawful outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders. A flask of anarchic water can be thrown as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, the bearer must open the flask and pour the anarchic water out onto the target. Thus, a character can douse an incorporeal creature with anarchic water only if he is adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A direct hit by a flask of anarchic water deals 2d4 points of damage to a lawful outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash. Material Component: 5 pounds of powdered iron and silver (worth 25 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Angelskin.MOD					DESC:You touch your ally with the holy symbol and invoke the blessed words. An opalescent glow spreads across her skin, imbuing it with a pearl-like sheen. The subject gains damage reduction 5/evil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anger of the Noonday Sun.MOD			DESC:Any creature within the area of the spell that can see you must make a saving throw or be temporarily blinded. The blindness lasts for 1 minute per caster level. An undead creature caught within the spell's area takes 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), or half damage if a Reflex save is successful. In addition, the beam results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light (such as a vampire) if it fails its save. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes as if they were undead creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Breath.MOD				DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue the energy of your breath weapon with coherence, mobility, and a semblance of life. The animated breath then attacks whomever or whatever you designate. The spell works only on breath weapons that deal energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) damage. The animated breath uses the statistics of a Huge fire elemental (MM 99), with the following exceptions. . The creature's subtype changes to match the energy damage dealt by the breath weapon. . The creature deals 2d8 points of damage of the same type as the breath weapon with each successful slam attack, instead of 2d8 points of fire. . The creature has immunity to its own energy type, but no vulnerability to another energy type. . The creature does not have the burn ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Fire.MOD					DESC:You animate a fire, which must be approximately the size of a campfire. The animated fire has the statistics of a Small fire elemental (MM 98), and attacks as you direct. It cannot move beyond the range of its source fire (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). Material Component: A handful of charcoal, sulfur, and soda ash.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Snow.MOD					DESC:You cause snow in the area to become 1d3+2 Large animated objects, 1d3 Huge animated objects, or one Gargantuan animated object (MM 14). The animated snow attacks as directed by your vocal commands. Animated snow does not have a hardness score. It possesses improved speed as if it had legs, granting it a speed of 30 feet, as well as the blind special ability (MM 13). In addition, each animated snow object has the cold subtype and deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit. Animated snow objects take 1d6 points of damage per round in a place where the temperature is above freezing.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Water.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like animate fire, but you can instead animate a quantity of water of at least 4 cubic feet into a Small water elemental (MM 100). Material Component: A vial of pure spring water mixed with cinnabar oil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Animate Wood.MOD					DESC:This spell imbues a Small or smaller wooden object with mobility and a semblance of life, then causes it to immediately attack whomever or whatever you initially designate. Statistics for the animated wood are as for a Small animated object (MM 13). Wooden objects animated by this spell have hardness 5. The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. Material Component: A mixture of powdered cinnabar and ground peach pit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anticipate Teleportation.MOD			DESC:The subject of the spell is surrounded with an invisible aura that anticipates and delays the teleportation of any creature into the spell's area. Any teleportation spell or effect (including all spells with the teleportation descriptor) can be anticipated, making the spell's recipient instantly aware of the exact location where the teleporting creature will arrive (subject to the restrictions below), the creature's size, and how many other creatures (and their sizes) are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrival of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it arrives on its initiative count immediately before its next turn), generally giving the recipient of the spell and anyone else made aware of the information 1 round to act or ready actions. The teleporting creature does not perceive this delay. Since a teleporting creature doesn't necessarily arrive at the precise location it intends, the spell also functions against a creature that arrives in range even though its intended destination was elsewhere. For a creature that intends to teleport into range but inadvertently arrives outside the spell's area, the spell gives the recipient awareness that a creature has attempted to teleport into range and delays the creature as normal, but doesn't give any awareness as to the actual location of its imminent arrival. The spell has no effect on creatures attempting to teleport away from the spell's area, although if their destination is within the area, the spell will affect their reentry as normal. Focus: A tiny hourglass of platinum and crystal costing at least 500 gp, which must be carried or worn by the spell's recipient while the spell is in effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anticipate Teleportation (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like anticipate teleportation, except that greater anticipate teleportation identifies the type of the arriving creature (and any companions accompanying it) and creates a delay of 3 rounds, providing the recipient with even more warning and preparation time. Focus: A tiny hourglass of platinum and crystal filled with diamond dust, costing at least 1,000 gp. The hourglass must be carried or worn by the spell's recipient while the spell is in effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anticold Sphere.MOD				DESC:All creatures within the area of the spell gain immunity to cold damage. In addition, the emanation prevents the entrance of any creature with the cold subtype. The effect hedges out such creatures in the area when it is cast. Note: Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier (PH 172).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Antidragon Aura.MOD				DESC:All subjects gain a +2 luck bonus to Armor Class and on saving throws against the attacks, spells, and special attacks (extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like) of dragons. This bonus increases by 1 for every four caster levels above 5th (to +3 at 9th, +4 at 13th, and a maximum of +5 at 17th). Material Component: A chunk of platinum worth at least 25 gp (slightly less than 1 ounce).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Antimagic Ray.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The target, if struck, functions as if it were inside an antimagic field (PH 200) if it fails its Will save. If this spell is used against a creature, the subject can't cast spells or use supernatural or spell-like abilities, nor do such abilities have any effect on the creature. However, the creature can still use spell completion items (such as scrolls) or spell trigger items (such as wands), even though it can't cast the spells required. If this spell is used against an object, that object's magical powers are suppressed-including any spells previously cast and currently in effect on the item, as well as any spells or magical effects targeted on the object during the antimagic ray's duration. The spell doesn't affect any objects other than the subject itself, even if those objects are worn, carried by, or in contact with the subject. For instance, if a creature is the target, its equipment remains unaffected. Material Component: A pinch of iron filings mixed with ruby dust worth 100 gp|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anyspell.MOD					DESC:Anyspell allows you to read and prepare any arcane spell of up to 2nd level. You must have an arcane magical writing (a scroll or spellbook) on hand to cast anyspell. During the spell's 15-minute casting time, you can scan the spells available and choose one to read and prepare. Once you choose and prepare an arcane spell, you retain it in your mind. The prepared spell occupies your 3rd-level domain spell slot. If you read the spell from a spellbook, the book is unharmed, but reading a spell from a scroll erases the spell from the scroll. When you cast the arcane spell, it works just as though cast by a wizard of your cleric level except that your Wisdom score sets the save DC (if applicable). You must have a Wisdom of at least 10 + the arcane spell's level to prepare and cast it. Your holy symbol substitutes for any noncostly material component. If the spell has a costly material component (one to which a gold piece value is assigned), you must provide it. If the spell has another focus, you must provide the focus. If the spell has an XP component, you must pay the experience point cost.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Anyspell (Greater).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like anyspell, except you can read and prepare any arcane spell of up to 5th level, and the prepared spell occupies your 6th-level domain spell slot.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Appraising Touch.MOD				DESC:You gain an intuitive insight into the value of objects you come into contact with. You gain a +10 insight bonus on Appraise checks to determine the value of items you touch while this spell is in effect. Using the Appraise skill in this fashion requires 2 minutes instead of the normal 1 minute. Even if you fail an Appraise check while this spell is in effect, you never mistakenly estimate the worth of an item by more than 50%%.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Arc of Lightning.MOD				DESC:This bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to both creatures and to anything in the line between them. Both creatures must be in range, and you must be able to target them both (as if this spell had them as its targets). Draw the line from any corner in one creature's space to any corner in the other's space. The bolt affects all squares in this line. Arcane Material Component: Two small iron rods.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Armor of Darkness.MOD				DESC:The shroud grants the subject a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class plus an additional +1 for every three caster levels above 7th (for a total of +5 at 10th level, +6 at 13th, +7 at 16th, to a maximum of +8 at 19th level). The subject can see through the armor as if it did not exist and is also afforded darkvision out to 60 feet. The subject gains a +2 saving throw bonus against any holy, good, or light spells or effects. Undead creatures that are subjects of armor of darkness also gain +4 turn resistance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Arrow Mind.MOD					DESC:While this spell is in effect and you are wielding a projectile weapon that fires arrows, such as a longbow or shortbow, you threaten all squares within your normal melee reach (5 feet if Small or Medium, 10 feet if Large) with your bow, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity with arrows shot from the bow. In addition, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when you shoot a bow while you are in another creature's threatened square. Material Component: A flint arrowhead|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Arrow of Bone.MOD					DESC:When thrown or fired at a creature as a normal ranged attack, the weapon gains a +4 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. In addition, any living creature struck by an arrow of bone must succeed on a Fortitude save or be instantly slain. A creature that makes its save instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Regardless of whether the attack hits, the magic of the arrow of bone is discharged by the attack, and the missile is destroyed. Material Component: A tiny sliver of bone and an oil of magic weapon (50 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Arrow Storm.MOD					DESC:You can cast this spell only at the beginning of your turn, before you take any other actions. After casting arrow storm, you can use a full-round action to make one ranged attack with a bow with which you are proficient against every foe within a distance equal to the weapon's range increment. You can attack a maximum number of individual targets equal to your character level. If you choose not to spend a full-round action in this fashion after casting the spell, the spell has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aspect of the Earth Hunter.MOD		DESC:When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a bulette (MM 30). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to magical beast, and your size changes to Huge. You have the space and reach of a bulette (15 feet/10 feet). You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution of an average bulette (Str 27, Dex 15, Con 20), but you retain your own mental ability scores. Your base land speed becomes 40 feet, and you gain a burrow speed of 10 feet. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You also gain low-light vision, scent, and tremorsense out to 60 feet. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base saving throw bonuses all remain the same. You lose any extraordinary special abilities of your own form, as well as spell-like and supernatural abilities. You keep all extraordinary special attacks derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage or a rogue's sneak attack), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. You cannot speak or cast spells while in bulette form. However, if you have the Natural Spell feat, you can cast spells normally. Your natural armor bonus becomes +12, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form. You can make two claw attacks, which are natural weapons that deal 2d8+8 points of damage. While in bulette form, you gain the bulette's leap extraordinary attack form, allowing you to make four claw attacks instead of two. Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional. Material Component: A small piece of a bulette's armored shell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aspect of the Wolf.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a wolf (MM 283). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to animal, and your size changes to Medium. You have the space and reach of a wolf (5 ft./5 ft.). You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution of an average wolf (Str 13, Dex 15, Con 15), but you retain your own mental ability scores. Your base land speed becomes 50 feet. You gain low-light vision and scent. You gain a bite attack, which is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6+1 points of damage with each successful hit. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base saving throw bonuses all remain the same. You lose any extraordinary special abilities of your own form, as well as spell-like and supernatural abilities. You keep all extraordinary special attacks derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage or a rogue's sneak attack), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. You cannot speak or cast spells while in wolf form. However, if you have the Natural Spell feat, you can cast spells normally. Your natural armor bonus becomes +2, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form. While in wolf form, you gain the wolf's trip extraordinary attack form, allowing you to make a free trip attempt against any opponent that you hit with your bite attack. Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional. Arcane Material Component: A whisker from a wolf.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Assay Spell Resistance.MOD			DESC:This spell gives you a +10 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of a specific creature. Assay resistance is effective against only one specific creature per casting, and you must be able to see the creature when you cast the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Astral Hospice.MOD				DESC:This spell can be cast only upon the Astral Plane (DMG 154). It opens up a small planar portal to a demiplane where natural healing can occur (unlike on the Astral Plane itself). The firm surface of the demiplane is roughly 50 feet square, and the demiplane extends 50 feet above the surface. The demiplane's traits (including time, gravity, and magic) match those of the Material Plane, and the demiplane is self-contained; walking to one end returns a character to the point from which he began. The demiplane has no unusual planar traits. The only way in or out of the demiplane is through the entrance created by you, and only those named or described by you upon the casting of the spell can enter. The portal continues to exist and remains visible on the Astral Plane only while the hospice demiplane exists. When you leave the demiplane, the portal seals shut and vanishes. Anyone still in the hospice demiplane at that time appears on the Astral Plane at the location of the hospice's entrance. Material Component: A single flawless gemstone of at least 250 gp value.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Attune Form.MOD					DESC:This spell allows you to attune the affected creatures to the plane you are currently on, negating the harmful effects of that plane. Affected creatures gain the protections described in the avoid planar effects spell (page 19). Arcane Material Component: A bit of stone or earth from your home plane.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Augment Familiar.MOD				DESC:This spell grants your familiar a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, damage reduction 5/magic, and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura Against Flame.MOD				DESC:You create an aura of blue mist that protects you against fire, absorbing the first 10 points of fire damage as a resist energy (fire) spell (PH 272). In addition to the resist energy (fire) effect, the spell can be used to snuff out fires. Any nonmagical flame that the aura contacts is immediately extinguished if the flame's maximum damage is 10 or fewer points per round. This means that torches, small fires, and hurled alchemist's fire are snuffed out and cause no damage if used against you or if you touch them. You can use a standard action to touch an existing magical fire (such as a flaming sphere or a wall of fire) and attempt to dispel it as if using a dispel magic spell against it (use the caster level of aura against flame for the caster level check). If you succeed, you take no damage from the touch and the magical fire and aura both vanish. If you fail, you take damage from the magical fire source normally (reduced by your aura against flame), and both spells remain. With a readied action, you can use the aura as a dispel magic effect to counterspell a magical fire attack against you. If successful, the spell is counterspelled and the aura disappears. If you fail the dispel check, or if the attack is not a fire attack, the aura remains.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura of Evasion.MOD				DESC:You and all creatures within 10 feet of you gain evasion, but only against breath weapons. (If a breath weapon would normally allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a creature within an aura of evasion that successfully saves takes no damage instead.) Creatures within the spell's area that already have evasion or improved evasion get a +4 bonus on Reflex saving throws against breath weapons. Material Component: Powdered emerald worth 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura of Glory.MOD					DESC:You channel divine power into yourself, spreading glory to your comrades. This spell removes any fear effect from all allies within your aura of courage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura of Terror.MOD				DESC:You become surrounded by an aura of fear, granting you a frightful presence not unlike that of a dragon. Whenever you charge or attack, you inspire fear in all creatures within 30 feet that have fewer Hit Dice than your caster level. Each potentially affected opponent must succeed on a Will save or become shaken-a condition that lasts until the opponent is out of range. A successful save leaves that opponent immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. If you cast this spell when you already have the frightful presence ability or a fear aura, the existing ability becomes more effective in the following ways: . The radius of the area affected by the ability increases by 10 feet. . The DC of your frightful presence ability increases by 2. . Creatures that would normally be shaken by your fear aura are frightened instead, and creatures that would normally be frightened are panicked.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Aura of Vitality.MOD				DESC:All subjects receive a +4 morale bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Avascular Mass.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If the attack is successful, the subject loses half its hit points (rounded down) and is stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned. Oozes and plants are not affected by this spell. The avascular mass instantaneously erupts from the subject and must be anchored to at least two opposed points-such as floor and ceiling or opposite walls-or else the mass collapses and has no effect. Creatures caught within a 20-foot-radius avascular mass become entangled. The original target of the spell is automatically entangled. Because the avascular mass is magically animate and gradually tightens on those it holds, an entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 25 Concentration check or lose the spell. Anyone within 20 feet of the primary target when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the avascular mass and is free to act, though moving might be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either from making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature can progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. If you have at least 5 feet of avascular mass between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of avascular mass between you, it provides total cover. The avascular mass of entangling tissue persists for 1 round per caster level. When the duration elapses, the blood vessel mass becomes so much limp, decaying tissue.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Avasculate.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If the attack succeeds, the subject is reduced to half of its current hit points (rounded down) and stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw, the subject is not stunned.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Avoid Planar Effects.MOD			DESC:You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (DMG 150). Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a waterdominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can't be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character's full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don't deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects. In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects. In the D&amp;D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane. The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren't negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades). The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won't protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Awaken (Mass).MOD					DESC:You awaken one or more trees or animals to humanlike sentience. All awakened creatures must be of the same kind. To succeed, you must make a Will save (DC 10 + the HD of the highest-HD target, or the HD the highest-HD tree has once awakened, whichever is greater). Failure indicates that the spell fails for all targets. The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with it, but it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object (MM 13), except that its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all 3d6. Awakened plants gain the ability to move their limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and they have senses similar to a human's. An awakened animal has 3d6 Intelligence, a +1d3 bonus to Charisma, and +2 HD. An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of its Intelligence bonus, if it has one. (See MM 290 for information on skills and feats the creature gains.) XP Cost: 250 XP per creature awakened.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Awaken Construct.MOD				DESC:This spell awakens a humanoid-shaped construct to humanlike sentience. An awakened construct's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all 3d6. The spell does not work on constructs that are constructs only temporarily (such as objects affected by an animate objects spell). The awakened creature is independent of both you and the being who originally made it, though it is initially friendly toward both you and its maker. (See MM 290 for information on skills and feats the creature gains.) Material Component: The brain of a humanoid that has been dead less than 8 hours. XP Cost: 5,000 XP. Awaken Sin.MOD	DESC:The subject immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and is stunned for 1 round. If this knocks the subject unconscious, it also takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Awaken Undead.MOD					DESC:This spell grants intelligence to mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies. Undead creatures with Intelligence scores are unaffected. A mindless undead gains an Intelligence score of 1d6+4, subject to the limitation that an undead cannot be more intelligent than is typical of a living creature of the same kind. A dog skeleton simply has Intelligence 2 (no roll needed), while an orc skeleton makes the die roll but can't have more than Intelligence 8. (See MM 290 for information on skills and feats the creature gains.) Undead regain the armor and weapon proficiencies they had in life (assume the undead were formerly warriors unless the DM specifies otherwise) and will don armor and take up weapons while obeying your commands. A zombie fighter can wear any armor and wield any simple or martial weapon, and a warhorse zombie can wear any armor. Undead also regain any extraordinary racial abilities they had in life, such as poison or scent. Awakened undead gain a +2 profane bonus on their Will saving throws to resist control undead. Awakened undead also gain +2 turn resistance (or retain their own turn resistance, if any, and if it is better than +2). Material Component: A humanoid finger bone. XP Cost: 250 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Axiomatic Storm.MOD				DESC:A driving rain falls around you. It falls in a fixed area once created. The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks. It also applies a -4 penalty on ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm. Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50%% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns). The rain damages chaotic creatures, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round (chaotic outsiders take double damage). In addition, each round, a gout of acid strikes a randomly selected chaotic outsider within the spell's area, dealing 5d6 points of acid damage. After the spell's duration expires, the water disappears. Material Component: A flask of axiomatic water (see the axiomatic water spell, below).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Axiomatic Water.MOD				DESC:This transmutation imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with the order of law, turning it into axiomatic water. Axiomatic water damages chaotic outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders. A flask of axiomatic water can be thrown as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, the bearer must open the flask and pout the axiomatic water out onto the target. Thus, a character can douse an incorporeal creature with axiomatic water only if he is adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A direct hit by a flask of axiomatic water deals 2d4 points of damage to a chaotic outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash. Material Component: 5 pounds of powdered iron and silver (worth 25 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Babau Slime.MOD					DESC:This demon-inspired transmutation causes the subject to secrete a slimy red layer of jelly that coats its skin, armor, and equipment. A creature that strikes a slime-protected subject with an unarmed strike, a touch attack (including a touch spell), or a natural weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage. Any creature in a grapple with the target of babau slime takes 1d8 points of acid damage at the beginning of its turn. Arcane Material Component: A drop of babau slime.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Backbiter.MOD					DESC:You cast this spell on any melee weapon. The next time that weapon is used to make a melee attack, its shaft twists around so that the weapon strikes the wielder instead. The weapon hits automatically, and no attack roll is made. The wielder gets no warning or knowledge of the spell's effect on his weapon, and although he makes the attack, the self-dealt damage can't be consciously reduced (though damage reduction applies) or changed to nonlethal damage. Once the weapon attacks its wielder (whether successfully or not), the spell is discharged. Magic weapons targeted by this spell receive a Will save. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its wielder's bonus, whichever is higher. Focus: A dagger.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Backlash.MOD					DESC:The first time the target creature attempts to cast a spell or use a spelllike ability, the magic of that spell backfires. The spell is expended, and the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell being cast. This discharge ends the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Balancing Lorecall.MOD				DESC:You gain a +4 insight bonus on Balance checks. If you have sufficient ranks in the Balance skill, you can even balance on an otherwise-impossible surface with a DC 20 Balance check. If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on vertical surfaces; the normal modifier for a sloped or angled surface no longer applies to you, though other DC modifiers (such as for a slippery surface) do apply. If you balance on a vertical surface, you can move up or down as if you were climbing. However, you are not actually climbing, so you can make attacks normally, retain your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and generally follow the rules of the Balance skill rather than the Climb skill. If you have 10 or more ranks in Balance, you can balance on liquids, semisolid surfaces such as mud or snow, or similar surfaces that normally couldn't support your weight. For each consecutive round that you begin balanced on a particular surface of this sort, the DC of your Balance check increases by 5. As with all uses of the Balance skill, you move at half speed unless you decide to use the accelerated movement option (thereby increasing the DC of the Balance check by 5). Arcane Material Component: A thin, 3-inch-long wooden dowel.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Baleful Transposition.MOD			DESC:Two target creatures, of which you can be one, instantly swap positions. A solid object such as the ground, a bridge, or a rope must connect the creatures. Both subjects must be within range. Objects carried by the creatures (up to the creatures' maximum loads) go with them, but other creatures do not, even if they are carried. The movement is instantaneous and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If either creature succeeds on its Will save, the spell is negated.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ball Lightning.MOD				DESC:You create a 5-foot-diameter ball of concentrated electricity that rolls in whichever direction you point, dealing electricity damage to creatures it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a subject. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. The ball moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you), otherwise it merely stays at rest, damaging any creature in its space. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. The lightning winks out if it exceeds the spell's range. Material Component: A handful of copper and iron pellets.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Balor Nimbus.MOD					DESC:The flames created by this spell do not harm you or any equipment you carry or wear. Each round, the flames deal 6d6 points of fire damage to any creature grappling you (or any creature you grapple) on your turn. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of soot.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bands of Steel.MOD				DESC:The victim must succeed on a Reflex save or be immobilized and thus unable to move. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim is only partially trapped by the bands, and is entangled. A creature immobilized by the bands can attempt to escape as a fullround action, either by bursting free (Strength DC 18) or wriggling out (Escape Artist DC 18). An entangled creature can use a fullround action to break free (Strength DC 13) or disentangle itself (Escape Artist DC 13). Material Component: Three small silver hoops, interlocked.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Barghest's Feast.MOD				DESC:Black flames flicker over a corpse, utterly consuming it. You destroy the remains of a dead person or creature, preventing any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50%% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell cannot restore to life a victim consumed by a barghest's feast spell. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the d%% roll fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. Material Component: A diamond worth 5,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Battering Ram.MOD					DESC:You create a ramlike force that can strike with considerable power. The force can target a creature or an object. The force deals 1d6 points of damage to the subject. If the subject is a creature, this attack initiates a bull rush (as a Medium creature with Strength 30, for a +10 bonus on the bull rush attempt). If the subject is a movable object, such as a door, you can make a Strength check (with a +10 bonus) to attempt to force open the door. Focus: A piece of carved ram's horn.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Battle Hymn.MOD					DESC:This spell brings forth a stirring martial tune that inspires all creatures within the area who are friendly to you. These creatures can reroll one Will save that they have just made each round for the duration of the spell. The reroll must be made before the DM declares whether the roll results in success or failure, and the result of the second roll must be used, even if it is a lower result.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Beast Claws.MOD					DESC:You gain two claw attacks that act as slashing melee weapons, dealing 1d4 points of damage with a threat range of 19-20. Attacks with your transformed hands do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks-you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus. If you attack with a manufactured weapon or another natural attack, you can't make any claw attacks in that round. The claws do not hinder your manual dexterity or spellcasting. Material Component: The claw of a bird of prey, such as an eagle or falcon.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Beastland Ferocity.MOD				DESC:The subject becomes such a tenacious combatant that it continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying. While between -1 and -9 hit points, the creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength. If the creature is reduced to -10 hit points, it dies normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Beget Bogun.MOD					DESC:Beget bogun allows you to infuse living magic into a small mannequin that you have created from vegetable matter. This is the final spell in the process of creating a bogun. See the bogun's description for further details. Material Component: The mannequin from which the bogun is created. XP Cost: 25 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Belker Claws.MOD					DESC:deal 2d12 points of damage. For every three caster levels, the smoke lasts for another round (to a maximum of 4 additional rounds at 12th level), dealing another 2d12 points of damage per round. Material Component: A small vial of smoke.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Benign Transposition.MOD			DESC:Two target creatures, of which you can be one, instantly swap positions. Both subjects must be within range. Objects carried by the creatures (up to the creatures' maximum loads) go with them, but other creatures do not, even if they are carried. The movement is instantaneous and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bestow Curse (Greater).MOD			DESC:The spellcaster places a curse on the creature touched, choosing one of the three following effects. . One ability score is reduced to 1, or two ability scores take -6 penalties (to a minimum score of 1). . -8 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. . Each turn, the subject has a 25%% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action. You can also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above, and the Dungeon Master has the final say on the curse's effect. A greater curse cannot be dispelled, nor can it can be removed with break enchantment or limited wish. A miracle or wish spell removes a greater curse, as does remove curse cast by a spellcaster of at least 17th level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Binding Winds.MOD					DESC:The subject can act normally, but it cannot move from its current location. The winds carry its voice away, so it can speak but cannot be heard, and it cannot hear anything but the roar of the winds. This spell distracts spellcasters, and so a Concentration check is required to successfully cast any spell (DC equal to this spell's DC + the level of the spell being cast). Furthermore, no sonic or languagedependent spells or effects can be cast into or out of the winds (though spells cast by you upon yourself function normally). Ranged attacks made into or out of the winds take a -2 penalty. Binding winds holds flying creatures in midair.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the King.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you can send a creature to a pocket "stomach" dimension with a successful melee touch attack. The target you touch must make a successful Fortitude save. If it fails its saving throw, the creature is sent to the stomach dimension. The victim takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage and 12 points of acid damage per round while in the stomach dimension. The victim can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the stomach dimension (AC 21). A creature that successfully exits appears to cut its way free from thin air, appearing in a space adjacent to you. Each time you cast this spell, you create a separate temporary stomach dimension.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Werebear.MOD			DESC:You gain a +16 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +8 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +7 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Your hands become claws, granting you two claw attacks, and your mouth becomes that of a bear, giving you a bite attack. You can attack with both claws at your full attack bonus, but your bite attack takes a -2 penalty (as if you had the Multiattack feat). Each claw deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d8 points of damage (2d6 if you are Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier. You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats, as well. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks. Material Component: A tuft of bear fur.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Wereboar.MOD			DESC:You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +8 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Your face becomes that of a boar, and you gain a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage (or 1d6 points if you are Small) + 1-1/2 times your Str modifier. You also gain the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks. Material Component: Four boar bristles.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Wererat.MOD				DESC:You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +3 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Your face lengthens into a ratlike snout, and you gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points if you are Small) + 1-1/2 times your Str modifier. You also gain the benefit of the Weapon Finesse feat. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks. Material Component: A rat's tail.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Weretiger.MOD			DESC:You gain a +12 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +5 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Your hands become claws, granting you two claw attacks, and your mouth becomes that of a tiger, giving you a bite attack. You can attack with both claws at your full base attack bonus, but your bite attack takes a -2 penalty (as if you had the Multiattack feat). Each claw deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d6 points of damage (2d6 if you are Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier. You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats, as well. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks. Material Component: A tiger's claw.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bite of the Werewolf.MOD			DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 points if you are Small) + 1-1/2 times your Str modifier. You also gain the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks. Material Component: A wolf's tooth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Black Blade of Disaster.MOD			DESC:You create a black blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long. The blade strikes at any creature within its range, as you desire, starting the round you cast the spell. The blade makes a melee touch attack against its designated target once each round. Its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Intelligence bonus or your Charisma bonus (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively). Anything hit by the blade is disintegrated if it fails a Fortitude save, taking 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6), or 5d6 points of damage if the saving throw is successful. The blade can pass through any magical barrier equal to or less than its spell level, but cannot penetrate dead magic areas or an antimagic field. It can harm ethereal and incorporeal creatures as if it were a force effect. The blade always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. If the blade exceeds its range or goes out of your line of sight, the spell ends. You can direct the blade to attack another target as a standard action. A gate spell can be used to counterspell a black blade of disaster. A dimensional anchor spell cast at the blade dispels it automatically. The blade cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation can affect it. Its touch attack AC is 13.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blackfire.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. On a successful attack, a living target is engulfed in chill black flames that feed on the fuel of their victim's life force. A creature engulfed in blackfire must make a successful Fortitude save each round that the spell is in effect or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and become nauseated. A creature that makes its Fortitude save takes no damage for that round and is sickened instead. In addition to its effects on the subject, blackfire can spread rapidly. Each round on its turn, any living creature adjacent to a creature engulfed in blackfire must succeed on a Reflex save or become engulfed itself. Any creature that has its Constitution reduced to 0 or lower by the spell is turned into a pile of black ash and can be returned to life only by true resurrection or wish, the caster of which must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check to restore the victim to life. If a creature succeeds on its Fortitude save in 3 consecutive rounds, the blackfire affecting it gutters out. The black flames cannot otherwise be extinguished by normal means (such as immersion in water or smothering), but antimagic field, a successful dispel magic, remove curse, or break enchantment snuffs it out. As well, a creature protected by death ward has immunity to blackfire's effects. Material Component: A pinch of dust from a vampire destroyed by sunlight.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blacklight.MOD					DESC:You create an area of total darkness. The darkness is impenetrable to normal vision and darkvision, but you can see normally within the blacklit area. Creatures outside the spell's area, even you, cannot see through it. You can cast the spell on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless you cast it cast on a mobile object. You can cast the spell on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. Unattended objects and points in space do not get saving throws or benefit from spell resistance. Blacklight counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, such as daylight. Material Component: A piece of coal and the dried eyeball of any creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blade of Pain and Fear.MOD			DESC:For the duration of the spell, you can make melee touch attacks that deal 1d6 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A creature that you successfully deal damage to must also make a Will saving throw or become frightened for 1d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blade Storm.MOD					DESC:You can cast this spell only at the beginning of your turn, before you take any other actions. After casting blade storm, you can take a full-round action to make one attack with each melee weapon you are currently wielding against every foe within reach. If you wield more than one weapon, or a double weapon, you can attack each foe once with each weapon or end, using the normal rules for two-weapon fighting (PH 160). So, a ranger wielding a longsword and a short sword could attack each opponent he can reach with both weapons. If you choose not to spend a full-round action in this fashion after casting the spell, the spell has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blade Thirst.MOD					DESC:You grant a slashing weapon a +3 enhancement bonus. The weapon sheds illumination as if it were a torch.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blades of Fire.MOD				DESC:Your melee weapons each deal an extra 1d8 points of fire damage. This damage stacks with any energy damage your weapons already deal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bladeweave.MOD					DESC:Once per round, choose one target that you successfully attacked with a melee weapon. That creature must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Spell resistance applies to this effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blast of Flame.MOD				DESC:Flames fill the area, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to any creature in the area that fails its saving throw. Material Component: A bit of wick soaked in oil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blast of Force.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A blast of force deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). In addition, a successful hit forces the subject to make a Fortitude save or be knocked prone (size and stability modifiers apply to the saving throw as if the spell were a bull rush).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bless Weapon (Swift).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like bless weapon (PH 205), except as noted above.
Blessed Aim.MOD					DESC:This spell grants your allies within the spread a +2 morale bonus on ranged attack rolls.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blessing of Bahamut.MOD				DESC:You gain damage reduction 10/magic for the spell's duration. Material Component: A canary feather, which is flung into the air.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blinding Breath.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like breath flare (page 38), except that targets that fail their saving throws against your breath weapon are permanently blinded, rather than dazzled.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blinding Spittle.MOD				DESC:You spit caustic saliva into your target's eyes with a successful ranged touch attack. A -4 penalty applies to the attack roll. The subject is blinded until it can wash its eyes with water or some other rinsing fluid, which requires a standard action. This spell has no effect on creatures without eyes or creatures that don't depend on eyes for vision.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blindsight.MOD					DESC:This spell grants the subject the blindsight ability (MM 306) effective out to 30 feet.
Blindsight (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like blindsight, except as noted above and that the blindsight granted by the spell is effective out to 60 feet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blink (Greater).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like blink (PH 206), except that you have control over the timing of your "blinking" back and forth between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane. You can also ready an action to blink away from any physical or magical attack. The attack misses automatically unless it also affects ethereal targets (as a force effect does). While blinking, you have no chance of interfering with your own attacks or your own spells. When moving through solid objects, you do not risk materializing inside one unless you actually end your movement there, in which case you materialize and are shunted off to the nearest open space, taking 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet traveled in this manner.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blistering Radiance.MOD				DESC:All sighted creatures in the area are dazzled (no save), and the heat from the blistering radiance deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in the area each round on your turn (Fortitude half). Like a fireball spell, blistering radiance erupts if it strikes any material body or solid barrier before attaining the prescribed range, and you must make a successful ranged touch attack to send the sphere through a narrow opening or passage. Blistering radiance counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level. Material Component: A bit of tinder and a small lens.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blood Frenzy.MOD					DESC:The target creature enters a rage, as its rage special ability, but this rage does not count toward the creature's number of rage attempts per day.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blood Sirocco.MOD					DESC:A blood sirocco blows out from your location with the force of a windstorm (DMG 95). Creatures in the affected area of Small or smaller size are knocked prone and rolled 1d4?10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. Medium creatures are knocked prone, and creatures of Large or Huge size are unable to move toward the origin point of the cone. A successful Fortitude save allows the creature to move normally in that round. In addition, the stifling winds dehydrate those within the cone. In each round when an affected living creature fails its saving throw, it takes 2 points of damage. The wind of a blood sirocco automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50%% chance to extinguish these lights. The wind of a blood sirocco continues to blow from the origin point to the wide end of the cone for the duration of the spell. Any creature within this area is entitled a saving throw each round to ignore the effects of the blood sirocco.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blood to Water.MOD				DESC:You transmute the subjects' blood into pure water, dealing 2d6 points of Constitution damage. A successful Fortitude save halves the Constitution damage. This spell has no effect on living creatures with the fire or water subtype.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Blood Wind.MOD					DESC:The subject can take a full attack action to use all of its natural weapons or unarmed strikes as if they were thrown weapons with a 20-foot range increment. The subject gestures as if making a melee attack, but the result of the attack affects a target within range. This spell does not actually grant reach, and so does not help provide a flanking bonus or allow the subject to make attacks of opportunity at any range greater than normal. The subject uses its normal melee attack bonuses and deals damage normally if it hits, though the target of the attacks can benefit from cover or concealment.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bloodhound.MOD					DESC:If you fail a Survival check to track a creature while this spell functions, you can immediately attempt another roll against the same DC to reestablish the trail. If the reroll fails, you must search for the trail for 30 minutes (if outdoors) or 5 minutes (if indoors) before trying again.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bloodstar.MOD					DESC:You create a magic construct called a bloodstar that shoots from your hand and hovers in the air anywhere within the limit of the range (each round, you can move the bloodstar anywhere within range with a standard action spent concentrating on the new position). The bloodstar pulses with ruby light (providing illumination in a 20-foot radius). Any creature you initially designate within 10 feet of the bloodstar that takes damage from any source must make a saving throw. On a failed save, the victim takes 1 point of Constitution damage. Each time victims are damaged, they can attempt new saves. The bloodstar cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks. Focus: A ruby worth at least 30 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bodak's Glare.MOD					DESC:Upon completion of the spell, you target a creature within range that can see you. That creature dies instantly unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. The target need not meet your gaze. If you slay a humanoid creature with this attack, 24 hours later it transforms into a bodak (MM 28) unless it has been resurrected in the meantime. The bodak is not under your command, but can be controlled as normal with a rebuke undead check. Focus: A black onyx gem worth at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body Blades.MOD					DESC:You sprout daggerlike blades from all the surfaces of your body and clothing. The blades appear metallic but are not actually metal, and never harm you or interfere with your movement or actions. You are proficient with your blades, and they allow you to deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your caster level (maximum 1d6+5) with a successful grapple attack. You can also make a regular melee attack (or offhand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. If a creature initiates a grapple with you, it takes the same damage, and you gain a bonus on grapple checks to resist the grapple equal to the damage dealt. You get a +4 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from a net, rope, grappler, or spell that entangles.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body Harmonic.MOD					DESC:As you rub the glass, the targeted creature's body begins to vibrate loudly and painfully in harmony with the tone. Each round you continue to concentrate on this spell, the victim takes 1d10 points of damage to one ability score. You must select a different ability score each round, and cannot damage any one ability score more than once every 5 rounds. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw each round to negate that round's effect. While the subject is under the effect of body harmonic, its body whines and hums discordantly. The victim takes a -20 penalty on Move Silently checks. Focus: A crystal water-filled goblet worth at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body of the Sun.MOD				DESC:Fire extends 5 feet in all directions from your body, illuminating the area and dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4). Adjacent creatures take fire damage each round on your turn.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Body of War.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a warforged titan (EBERRON Campaign Setting 302). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to construct, and your size changes to Huge. You have the space and reach of a warforged titan (15 feet/15 feet). Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and cannot cast spells, even from magic items. You gain the Strength and Dexterity of an average warforged titan (Str 28, Dex 8), but you retain your own mental ability scores. You have no Constitution score while affected by this spell. Your base land speed becomes 50 feet. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You also gain low-light vision. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base saving throw bonuses all remain the same. You lose any extraordinary special abilities of your own form, as well as spell-like and supernatural abilities. You keep all extraordinary special attacks derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage or a rogue's sneak attack), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. You cannot speak or cast spells while in warforged titan form. Your natural armor bonus becomes +18, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form, and you gain damage reduction 10/adamantine. As a construct, you have the following qualities: immunity to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects, critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, and to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). You also gain the warforged titan's two attack forms (axe and maul), along with the trample special ability (damage 1d8+13; Reflex DC 25 half). The warforged titan's axe deals 2d8 points of slashing damage and has a ?3 critical modifier; its maul (essentially a huge warhammer) deals 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage and also has a ?3 critical modifier. Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional. Material Component: A miniature bronze hammer.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bolt of Glory.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A creature struck takes varying damage, depending on its nature or its home plane of existence and your level. Creatures native to the Negative Energy Plane, evil-aligned outsiders, and all undead creatures take 1d12 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d12). Creatures native to the Material Plane or an Elemental Plane, or any other neutral-aligned outsiders, take 1d12 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 7d12). Creatures native to the Positive Energy Plane and all good-aligned outsiders are not affected by this spell. Bolts of Bedevilment.MOD	DESC:This spell grants you the ability to make one ray attack per round. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A living creature struck by the ray is dazed for 1d3 rounds if it fails its save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bombardment.MOD					DESC:You designate the spot on which the cylinder is centered. Each creature in the area that fails a Reflex saving throw takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and is buried under 5 feet of rubble. A successful save halves the damage and avoids burial. A buried creature can free itself with a DC 20 Strength check (a full-round action), or it can be dug free by others (a single creature working alone requires 1 minute to free a trapped creature). A buried creature is unable to move, and cannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material components must be in hand. After this spell is cast, its area is covered in 5 feet of dense rubble (DMG 90). Focus: A quartz crystal embedded in rock.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bonefiddle.MOD					DESC:You call up a ghostly fiddle bow in the air above the targeted creature. This bow immediately descends into the target body and begins to saw back and forth against its skeleton. Although the music produced is eerily beautiful, it causes intense pain and anguish in the victim. Each round on its turn, the victim must make a Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of sonic damage and a -20 penalty on Move Silently checks. A successful save negates the damage and ends the spell. The spell's effects continue even if the subject moves so that you no longer have line of sight or line of effect to it. Focus: A miniature silver fiddle worth at least 30 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bottle of Smoke.MOD				DESC:You create a plume of smoke that you capture in a special bottle you're holding. If the bottle is thereafter opened before the spell duration expires, the smoke emerges to form a vaguely horselike creature made of wisps of smoke. It makes no sound, and anything that touches it simply passes through it. To mount this smoke horse, the would-be rider must make a DC 10 Ride check while holding the bottle in one hand. Anyone attempting to mount without the bottle simply passes through the horse's form. Letting go of the bottle after mounting causes the rider to fall through the horse's smoky form; he or she cannot thereafter remount without the intact bottle in hand. If the bottle is broken, the spell ends immediately and the rider (if mounted) falls to the ground. The smoke horse has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can send smoke billowing out behind it at the rider's behest, leaving behind a bank of smoke 5 feet wide and 20 feet high as it moves. A severe wind, or magical wind of any kind, disperses the horse (and any smoke it has produced) instantly. Otherwise, the bank of smoke lasts 10 minutes, starting on the turn it was laid down. Starting or stopping the smoke trail is a free action. The mount and the smoke trail it produces give concealment to anyone behind them. The mount is immune to all damage and other attacks because material objects and spells simply pass through it. It cannot attack. The rider can return the smoke horse to the bottle, and thus pause the spell, at any time by simply uncorking it (a move action) and stoppering it again (another move action) in the next round after the horse is inside. If the bottle is reopened later, the spell reactivates with its remaining duration intact. Regardless of how much duration remains unused, the spell ceases functioning 24 hours after it is cast. If dispelled at any time while the bottle is corked, the spell ends. Focus: An ornate, corked bottle worth at least 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Brain Spider.MOD					DESC:For the duration of the spell, as a standard action, you can eavesdrop on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once, hearing as desired: . A creature's surface thoughts. . Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire. . One nugget of information per caster level from all the minds regarding one particular topic, thing, or being. . The thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail. Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature's mind, you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a suggestion (PH 285) in the mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving throw to resist the suggestion, using the original save DC. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use this resistance to keep from being affected by the suggestion.) Success on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the brain spider for that creature. Material Component: A dead spider of any size or type. It must still have all eight legs.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Brambles.MOD					DESC:For the duration of the spell, the weapon deals both piercing and bludgeoning damage. It gains a +1 enhancement bonus on its attacks and also gains a +1 enhancement bonus per caster level on melee damage rolls (maximum +10). This spell works only on melee weapons with wooden striking surfaces. For instance, it does not work on a bow, an arrow, or a metal mace. Material Component: A small thorn.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Branch to Branch.MOD				DESC:You gain a +10 competence bonus on Climb checks made in trees. As long as you remain at least 10 feet above the ground, you can brachiate (swing by branches and vines) in medium or dense forest, but not in sparse forest. When you brachiate, you gain a 10-foot enhancement bonus to your land speed and ignore the hampered movement penalties for undergrowth and other terrain features. You can charge while brachiating, but you can't run. Naturally, some local conditions, such as areas of sparse forest, clearings, wide rivers, or other breaks in the forest canopy, might force you to return to the ground.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Breath Flare.MOD					DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon that uses fire or electricity, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, your breath weapon is suffused with bright light. In addition to taking the normal fire or electricity damage, creatures that fail their saving throws against the breath weapon are dazzled for 1 minute per caster level. Sightless creatures are not affected by breath flare.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Breath of the Jungle.MOD			DESC:The DC of any saving throw made within the mist against poison or disease increases by 2. The mist does not provide concealment.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Breath Weapon Admixture.MOD			DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you choose one type of energy other than that normally associated with your breath weapon: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can modify your breath weapon to add an equal amount of the energy you choose. For example, a great wyrm red dragon whose breath weapon normally deals 24d10 points of fire damage could use this spell to produce a cone dealing 24d10 points of fire damage and 24d10 points of acid damage. Even opposed types of energy, such as fire and cold, can be combined using this spell. If you choose sonic energy, the save DC of your breath weapon is reduced by 2. When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy, it is a spell of that type. For example, breath weapon admixture is an acid spell when you cast it to add acid damage to your breath weapon.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Breath Weapon Substitution.MOD		DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you choose one type of energy other than that normally associated with your breath weapon: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You can modify your breath weapon to use the selected energy type instead of its normal energy type. For example, an old red dragon whose breath weapon normally deals 16d10 points of fire damage could use this spell to produce a cone dealing 16d10 points of acid damage instead. When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy, it is a spell of that type. For example, breath weapon substitution is an acid spell when you cast it to change your breath weapon to deal acid damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Briar Web.MOD					DESC:This spell causes grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees to grow thorns and wrap and twist around creatures in or entering the area. The spell's area becomes difficult terrain, and creatures move at half speed within the affected area. Any creature moving through the area also takes 1 point of nonmagical piercing damage for each 5 feet moved. A creature with freedom of movement or the woodland stride ability is unaffected by this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Brilliant Aura.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like brilliant blade (see below), except as noted here, and that all weapons of the subject creatures gain the brilliant energy special ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Brilliant Blade.MOD				DESC:You transform a single melee weapon, natural weap on, thrown weapon, or group of projectiles into a weapon with the brilliant energy special ability (DMG 224). If this spell is cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Bristle.MOD						DESC:The bristle spell temporarily enhances one suit of armor, causing it to grow long hard spikes that stick out in all directions. This spell does not work on clothing other than armor, but it does function with armor that already has spikes built in. The spikes are flexible enough not to hamper the creature wearing the armor. Each round, the first time the armor wearer attacks a target in melee, the spikes strike out as well, growing in length and hardness. The spikes have an attack bonus equal to your caster level and deal 2d6 points of damage. Your Strength modifier does not apply to this damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Buoyant Lifting.MOD				DESC:The subjects of this spell are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they are floating on it. The subject then rests at the top of the liquid (rescuing it from drowning if it was a sinking air-breather) and can swim away under its own power or be moved by others (such as with a rope). If the subject is removed from the liquid, the spell ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Burning Blood.MOD					DESC:You taint a living creature's blood with a hot, corrosive infusion, dealing 1d8 points of acid damage and 1d8 points of fire damage per round. The subject can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage, but a successful save does not prevent damage in future rounds. Searing pain limits the subject to a single move action in any round when it fails its Fortitude save. Burning blood does not affect creatures of the construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead types. Material Component: A drop of blood and a pinch of saltpeter.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Burning Sword.MOD					DESC:The flames from this spell shed azure light out to 30 feet. These flames do not harm the weapon or its wielder, but for the duration of the spell, it delivers fire damage in addition to its normal damage. The enchanted weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. Also, on a critical hit, the weapon deals additional fire damage based on the weapon's critical multiplier: Critical Additional Multiplier Fire Damage ?2 +1d10 ?3 +2d10 ?4 +3d10|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Burrow.MOD						DESC:The subject can burrow through earth and loose rock (but not solid stone) with a speed of 30 feet (or 20 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). Arcane Focus: A claw from a burrowing creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Burrow (Mass).MOD					DESC:This spell functions like burrow, except that it affects multiple creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Buzzing Bee.MOD					DESC:This spell creates an unnerving noise that disrupts the subject's concentration. The subject is distracted and takes a -10 penalty on Move Silently checks. Creatures that can't hear are not distracted. The DC of Concentration checks to cast spells or maintain concentration while distracted is equal to this spell's DC + the level of the spell being cast. The bee has a fly speed of 180 feet (perfect). It remains near the subject in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorph, cover, concealment, or any other attempt at disguising or hiding. The bee remains until the spell's duration expires or the subject moves out of range. The bee can't be attacked, but it can be dispelled. Material Component: A dab of honey.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cacophonic Burst.MOD				DESC:You cause a burst of low, discordant noise to erupt at the chosen location. It deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within the area. Cacophonic burst cannot penetrate the area of a silence spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cacophonic Shield.MOD				DESC:You create a barrier of sonic energy at a distance of 10 feet from yourself. Creatures on either side of the barrier hear it as a loud but harmless buzzing. Nonmagical sound (including sound produced by a thunderstone) does not cross the barrier. Supernatural or spell-based sounds or sonic effects penetrate the barrier only if the caster or originator of the effect succeeds on a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level). A creature that crosses the barrier takes 1d6 points of sonic damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20) and must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The sonic vibrations create a 20%% miss chance for any missiles (including siege weapon attacks) crossing the barrier in either direction. The barrier moves with you, but you cannot force another creature to pass through it (for example, by moving adjacent to an enemy). If you force a creature to pass through, the barrier has no effect on that creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Call Kolyarut.MOD					DESC:By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a kolyarut inevitable (MM 159). If you know an individual kolyarut's name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway). You can ask the kolyarut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task. XP Cost: 250 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Call Marut.MOD					DESC:By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a marut inevitable (MM 159). If you know an individual marut's name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway). You can ask the marut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task. XP Cost: 500 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Call Zelekhut.MOD					DESC:By casting this spell, you receive the aid of a zelekhut inevitable (MM 160). If you know an individual zelekhut's name, you can request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature, anyway). You can ask the zelekhut to perform one duty for you. The task must take no more than 1 hour to complete. The inevitable does not ask for any payment for the task. XP Cost: 100 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Caltrops.MOD					DESC:A caltrops spell covers one 5-foot-by-5- foot square with caltrops. Every time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area, it might step on one. The caltrops make one attack roll (+0 melee) against the creature. For this attack, the target's shield and deflection bonuses do not count, nor does its armor bonus for armor worn. A target wearing shoes or other footwear gains a +2 armor bonus to Armor Class (which does count). If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. A successful attack by a caltrop deals 1 point of damage. If the target is Small, Medium, or Large, its land speed is reduced by one-half because of the injury. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble. The DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents or opponents outside the size range given above. A giant centipede, for example, can scramble among the caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing thick, massive boots might be immune to their attacks. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can affect an additional 5-footby- 5-foot square, and the caltrops' attack bonus increases by 1. Thus, you affect two squares at 3rd level (+1 melee), three at 5th level (+2 melee), four at 7th level (+3 melee), and a maximum of five at 9th level or higher (+4 melee maximum). Multiple caltrops spells (or mundane caltrops) occupying the same space have no additional effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Camouflage.MOD					DESC:Throughout the duration of the spell, your coloration changes instantly to match the background of any new environment you enter, with no effort on your part. This effect grants you a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Camouflage (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like camouflage, except the effect is mobile with the group. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 60 feet from the nearest member of the group. (If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its camouflage. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 60 feet.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Capricios Zephyr.MOD				DESC:A ball of swirling wind and dust moves as you direct it, pushing your foes across the battlefield. From its starting point, a capricious zephyr moves 30 feet per round in the direction you point, regardless of the presence or absence of terrain. If the sphere enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for that round and tries to bowl over the creature with its wind force. That creature must resist a bull rush attack from the capricious zephyr, which has a +6 bonus on the check. If the spell wins the bull rush, it pushes the creature as far as it can in a random direction (roll 1d8; 1 indicates a push into the square closest to you, and 2 through 8 indicate the other squares, moving clockwise around the creature). Any creature pushed by the sphere must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone. A capricious zephyr moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you). Otherwise, it merely stays at rest and attempts to bowl over anyone in its square. The spell ends if the distance between the sphere and you ever exceeds the spell's range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cast in Stone.MOD					DESC:Any creature within 30 feet that meets your gaze is permanently turned into a mindless, inert statue (as flesh to stone), unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. You can free the victim of your own cast in stone at any time by speaking a command word you establish during the casting. Each creature within range of the gaze must attempt a saving throw against the gaze effect each round at the beginning of its turn. A creature can avert its eyes, which grants a 50%% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants you concealment relative to it. A creature can close its eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting it but grants you total concealment from that creature. In addition, you can actively attempt to use the gaze as a standard action each round. To do so, you choose a target within range, and that target must attempt a saving throw. A target that is averting or shutting its eyes gains the above benefits.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Castigate.MOD					DESC:This spell has no effect on creatures that cannot hear. All creatures whose alignment differs from yours on both the law-chaos and the good-evil axes take 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4). All creatures whose alignment differs from yours on one component take half damage, and this spell does not deal damage to those who share your alignment. For example, a lawful good cleric who casts this spell deals full damage to any creature that is not lawful and not good, half damage to any creature that is lawful or good (but not both), and no damage to lawful good creatures. A Fortitude saving throw reduces damage by half.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Celebration.MOD					DESC:You cause any creatures in the area to feel increasingly more intoxicated the longer you perform a drinking song. In the round this spell is cast, all creatures that fail their saving throws take a -2 penalty to Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom. If you use a standard action to continue performing in a second consecutive round, each affected creature must succeed on a second Will saving throw or become nauseated. Succeeding on this saving throw prevents the nausea, and the creature is immune to further effects of this spell. If you use a standard action to continue performing in a third consecutive round, any affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or pass out, becoming unconscious and helpless.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Chain Missile.MOD					DESC:Missiles of magical energy dart from your fingertip to unerringly strike a creature. The missiles strike one creature initially, then spring to other targets. Each missile deals 1d4+1 points of force damage. One missile strikes the primary target per two caster levels, to a maximum of ten missiles (dealing 10d4+10 points of damage). After the missiles strike, they ricochet to a number of targets up to the number of missiles created by the spell. Each secondary target takes 1d4+1 points of damage, as if struck by a single magic missile. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no secondary target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example). Missiles without a secondary target do not ricochet off the primary target. Spells, magic items, and abilities that protect against magic missile (such as the shield spell or a brooch of shielding) also protect against this spell. If the primary target has that sort of protection, the spell has no effect against it but still springs to all secondary targets. (A brooch of shielding loses a number of charges equal to the number of missiles hitting the creature-up to ten missiles.) If spell resistance causes the spell to fail to harm the primary target, the spell fails and missiles do not ricochet to additional targets. The missiles strike unerringly, even if the targets are in melee or have anything less then total cover or concealment. You cannot single out specific parts of a creature to strike. This spell cannot target or damage inanimate objects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Chain of Eyes.MOD					DESC:You can use another creature's vision instead of your own. While this spell gives you no control over the subject, each time it comes into physical contact with another living being, you can choose to transfer your sensor to the new creature. During your turn in a round, you can use a free action to switch from seeing through the current creature's eyes to seeing normally or back again. Each transfer attempt allows the new target a saving throw and spell resistance. If a target resists, the spell ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Charge of the Triceratops.MOD			DESC:The horns created by this spell grant a natural gore attack that deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 points of damage if the subject creature is Small, 2d6 if Large). If the gore attack is used as part of a charge, it deals double damage. If the gore attack is used as a primary weapon, the subject adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage of the attack. If it is used as a secondary weapon, the subject adds only 1/2 its Strength bonus to the damage roll, and takes a -5 penalty on the attack roll. The recipient also gains a +4 enhancement bonus to its natural armor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cheat.MOD						DESC:At one point during the duration of this spell, you can attempt to alter the outcome of a game of chance. This spell can affect only nonmagical games, such as those using cards or dice. It cannot affect a game involving magic, nor a magic item involved in a game of chance (such as a deck of many things). Whenever a dice roll is made to determine the outcome of the game, a character under the effect of this spell can demand a reroll and take the better of the two rolls. Anyone observing the game of chance is allowed a Will saving throw to realize something fishy is going on, and might suspect that the outcome of the game has been magically altered. For example, Darkon is playing a game that he has a 1 in 4 chance of winning. The DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells the player that Darkon lost. Because Darkon is under the effect of a cheat spell, the player can have the DM reroll. The spell alters probability, so there is no subterfuge that another character could notice (except for the casting of the spell itself). Focus: A pair of dice made from human bones.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Checkmate's Light.MOD				DESC:You imbue the touched weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level), and it is treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, you can cause it to cast a red glow as bright as a torch. Any creature within the radius of its clear illumination (20 feet) gets a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the weapon leaves your grasp, the spell effect is suppressed until you or another worshiper of your deity picks it up. Time that passes while the spell's effects are suppressed counts against the spell's duration.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Chill of the Grave.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The subject takes 1d10 points of cold damage. This damage increases to 2d10 at caster level 4th, 3d10 at caster level 7th, and 4d10 at caster level 10th.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Circle Dance.MOD					DESC:You divine the relative direction and condition of another creature. You must have firsthand knowledge of the creature for the spell to function. If the creature is alive and on the same plane as you, the spell leaves you facing in its direction. You also get an impression of its physical and emotional condition (unharmed, wo u n d e d , unconscious, dying, and so on). If the creature you seek is on a different plane or dead, you feel nothing.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clarity of Mind.MOD				DESC:You grant the subject a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. If the subject of clarity of mind attacks a creature that has concealment and fails the miss chance roll, he can reroll the miss chance once to see if his attack actually hit the target.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Claws of the Bear.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, your hands become natural weapons that deal 1d8 points of damage each or your normal unarmed damage, whichever is greater. You are considered armed while this spell is in effect. If you are Small, your claws deal 1d6 points of damage, and if you are Large, they deal 2d6 points of damage. You add your Strength modifier to your claw damage rolls. Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks-you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Claws of Darkness.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, your hands become shadowy claws. Starting on your next action, you can use the claws to make unarmed attacks as if they were natural weapons. (You attack with one claw and can use the other claw for an off-hand attack. If you have multiple attacks, you use them normally when attacking with the claws.) Attacks with the claws are melee touch attacks. Each claw deals 1d8 points of cold damage. If you grapple an opponent, you deal claw damage with each successful grapple check, and the grappled target is under the effect of a slow spell for as long as you maintain the grapple. An opponent that makes a successful Fortitude save is not slowed, and it cannot be slowed by this casting of claws of darkness. You can extend the claws up to 6 feet, which gives you a natural reach of 10 feet, or retract them as a free action. When the spell is in effect, you cannot cast spells with components other than verbal ones, nor can you carry items with your hands. Any magic items worn on your hands are temporarily absorbed and cease functioning while the spell is active.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clear Mind.MOD					DESC:You gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws made against mind-affecting spells and effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Climb Walls.MOD					DESC:The subject gains a +10 enhancement bonus on Climb checks. The bonus increases to +20 at caster level 5th, and to +30 (the maximum) at caster level 9th. Unlike with spider climb, this spell does not allow the subject to climb on ceilings, and it does not give the creature a climb speed. Material Component: A drop of tree sap or equally sticky material.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloak of Bravery.MOD				DESC:All allies within the emanation (including you) gain a morale bonus on saves against fear effects equal to your caster level (to a maximum of +10 at caster level 10th).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloak of Bravery (Greater).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like cloak of bravery, except all allies within the emanation (including you) are immune to fear effects and gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls. Allies who don't have line of sight to you are unaffected.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloak of Dark Power.MOD				DESC:Cloak of dark power creates a dusky haze around the subject. The haze does not interfere with vision, but the subject and anything it wears or carries is protected from the effects of full sunlight, even under the open, daytime sky of the surface world. A drow subject suffers no blindness or bright illumination combat penalties while under the effect of cloak of dark power. The subject also gains a +4 resistance bonus on saves against light or darkness spells or effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloak of the Sea.MOD				DESC:While underwater, the subject functions as if affected by blur (PH 206), freedom of movement (PH 233), and water breathing (PH 300), and doesn't take nonlethal damage for the duration of the spell. When out of the water (or even partially out), the subject gains none of these advantages except water breathing. The subject can leave and reenter water without ending the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloak Pool.MOD					DESC:This spell causes a color pool on the Astral Plane (DMG 154)-an irregular patch of color containing a portal to another plane-to seemingly cease to exist. In truth, the color pool is only hidden from view. The use of this spell does not hide the area around the pool; it masks only the fact that a pool is present. See invisibility or true seeing reveals the presence of the pool, as does analyze portal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Close Wounds.MOD					DESC:This spell cures 1d4 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). If you cast this spell immediately after the subject takes damage, it effectively prevents the damage. It would keep alive someone who had just dropped to -10 hit points, for example, leaving the character at negative hit points but stable. Used against an undead creature, close wounds deals damage instead of curing the creature (which takes half damage if it makes a Will saving throw).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloud of Bewilderment.MOD			DESC:This spell creates a small cloud of nauseating vapors. Any living creature in the area becomes nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. The cloud obscures sight, including darkvision, providing concealment to creatures within the area or against attacks made through the cloud. Material Component: A rotten egg.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloud Wings.MOD					DESC:This spell increases the subject's fly speed by 30 feet. It has no effect on other modes of movement, nor does it allow the subject to fly if it cannot already do so.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloudburst.MOD					DESC:You cause clouds to gather and a heavy rain to fall. The rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a -4 penalty on Spot and Search checks. It automatically extinguishes unprotected flames and has a 50%% chance of extinguishing protected flames. Ranged weapon attacks and Listen checks take a -4 penalty. Fire damage in this spell's area is reduced by 1 point per die of damage. This spell does not function indoors, underground, underwater, or in desert climates. After the spell ends, the water created evaporates over the next 10 minutes. The water created with this spell does not slake thirst or provide any nourishment to plants.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cloud-Walkers.MOD					DESC:Each subject of the spell can move with a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability), but only outdoors. To touch the earth again, a subject must use a standard action to shake off the cloudstuff, which ends the spell for that creature. You can dismiss the spell, but only for all subjects at once-an act that can have significant consequences for subjects already in the air.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clutch of Orcus.MOD				DESC:Magical force grips the subject's heart (or similar vital organ) and begins crushing it. The victim is paralyzed and takes 1d12 points of damage per round. Concentration is required to maintain the spell each round. A conscious victim can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw each round to end the spell. If the victim dies as a result of this spell, its smoking heart appears in your hand.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cocoon.MOD						DESC:When cast upon a deceased creature (whose death can be no less recent than 1 round per caster level), this spell preserves the body and begins a slow process of rebirth. If the corpse is raised, resurrected, or reincarnated at any point during the next week, the creature takes no level loss or Constitution loss normally associated with such spells. At the conclusion of the week, if the subject has not been returned to life, the creature is automatically reincarnated, as the spell, with no loss of level or Constitution. Material Component: A silkworm cocoon. XP Cost: 250 XP|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cold Fire.MOD					DESC:You are able to change the normal flames of a fire (any blaze that lasts for more than 1 round) into cold flames. Affected flames deal cold damage to creatures that come into contact with them. The spell can also affect magical fires such as those generated by a wall of fire, provided the affected fire is small enough. Cold fire flames burn blue and white for the duration of the spell. If the target is a creature with the fire subtype or vulnerability to cold, the spell deals 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to the creature, but has no further effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cold Snap.MOD					DESC:This spell causes a powerful cold front to form, lowering the temperature in the affected area by 5 degrees Fahrenheit per caster level (maximum change of 50 degrees Fahrenheit), to a maximum low of -20 degrees Fahrenheit (see Cold Dangers, DMG 302). Spells with the cold descriptor deal an extra 1 point of damage per die when cast in the area.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Combust.MOD						DESC:This spell makes a combustible object or a creature's combustible equipment burst into flame, even if damp. If the target is a creature, the initial eruption of flame causes 2d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) with no saving throw. The creature must make a Reflex save (DC 15) or catch on fire. (See Catching on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide). If the target is a combustible, unattended object, the initial eruption of flame inflicts fire damage on the object as noted above. The object catches fire and takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until consumed or someone puts out the fire. Anyone touching the object during the initial eruption of flame takes the same fire damage the object does. A Reflex save reduces damage by half. If a creature touching the object fails the Reflex save, it must make another Reflex save (DC 15) to avoid catching fire. This spell originally appeared in Magic of Faerun. Material Component: A drop of oil and a piece of flint.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell  Cometfall.MOD	DESC:You conjure a comet that immediately falls to the ground, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to everything in the area. The force of the comet can also knock creatures over. Creatures who fail their Reflex save are knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half damage from the comet and is not knocked down. The comet breaks apart on impact, filling the 10-foot-square area with dense rubble (DMG 90). You must cast this spell in an area with at least 40 feet of vertical space above the point of impact. If you do not have 40 feet of space, the spell fails.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cone of Dimness.MOD				DESC:Creatures in the cone must succeed on a Will save or believe darkness has engulfed them, rendering them blinded. A creature that makes its initial Will save suffers no ill effects. A creature that fails its initial save can attempt a new saving throw each round until it succeeds or the spell expires. Failing the subsequent saving throws results in continued blindness. Success on a later save means the creature feels its vision beginning to clear, although its vision remains dim and hazy for the remainder of the spell. This results in a 20%% miss chance for any attack the creature makes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Consumptive Field.MOD				DESC:All creatures in the area with fewer than 0 hit points that fail their saving throws die, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength for each death caused by this spell and until the spell's duration expires. Additionally, your effective caster level increases by one per death caused by this spell, to a maximum increase of half your original caster level, improving spell effects that are dependent on caster level. (This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells, and it does not increase the duration of this spell.) Creatures that fall to -1 hit points or lower in the area after the spell is cast are likewise subject to its effect. No creature can be affected by this spell more than once per casting, regardless of the number of times that the area of the spell passes over them.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Consumptive Field (Greater).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like consumptive field, except that the field affects all creatures in the area with 9 hit points or fewer. Such creatures that fail their saving throws die, and creatures that fall to 9 hit points or lower in the area after the spell is cast are likewise subject to its effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Contagion (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like contagion (PH 213), but all creatures within the area are infected.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Contagious Fog.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like fog cloud (PH 232), except as noted here. Each round that a creature is within the fog, it must make a Fortitude save or contract a disease equivalent to the shakes (DMG 292), which strikes immediately (no incubation period). A creature afflicted with this disease takes 1d8 points of Dexterity damage immediately, and each day that the disease persists, it must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or take another 1d8 points of Dexterity damage. The fog moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground or water. (Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new center, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.) Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the surface over which they move, pouring down sinkhole openings, and even down through minute cracks. Contagious fog cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater. Material Component: A used handkerchief.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Contagious Touch.MOD				DESC:Upon casting this spell, you choose one disease from this list: blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever, mindfire, red ache, the shakes, or slimy doom (DMG 292). Any living creature you hit with a melee touch attack during the spell's duration is affected as though by the contagion spell, immediately contracting the disease you have selected unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. You cannot infect more than one creature per round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Contingent Energy Resistance.MOD		DESC:This spell functions similarly to contingency (PH 213), but with a more limited scope. While contingent energy resistance is in effect, if you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell automatically grants you resistance 10 against that type of energy for up to 10 minutes per caster level, or until the remainder of the spell's duration, just as if you were under the effect of a resist energy spell of the appropriate type. Once the energy type protected against by a particular casting of this spell is determined, it can't be changed. You can't have more than one contingent energy resistance in effect on yourself at the same time-if you cast the spell a second time while an earlier casting is still in effect, the earlier spell automatically expires. The energy resistance granted by this spell does not stack with similar benefits against the same energy type (such as from the resist energy spell). However, it is possible to be simultaneously under the effect of resist energy (fire) and contingent energy resistance (electricity), or any other two such spells that protect against different types of energy. Material Component: An oyster shell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Conviction.MOD					DESC:This spell bolsters the mental, physical, and spiritual strength of the creature touched. The spell grants the subject a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every six caster levels you have (maximum +5 morale bonus at 18th level). Material Component: A small parchment with a bit of holy text written upon it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Conviction (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like conviction, except that it affects multiple allies at a distance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Corona of Cold.MOD				DESC:You are surrounded by a protective aura of cold that also causes damage to others within its radius. You gain resistance to fire 10. Starting in the round you cast the spell, corona of cold also deals 1d12 points of cold damage each round at the beginning of your turn to all other creatures within the area. A successful save prevents the damage caused by the spell in that round, but does not prevent damage in future rounds. Creatures damaged by the spell shiver uncontrollably, taking a -2 penalty to their Strength and Dexterity and moving at half speed for as long as they remain within the area; these penalties do not stack with consecutive rounds of damage or additional corona of cold spells.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Corporeal Instability.MOD			DESC:Your touch transforms a living creature into a spongy, amorphous mass, its shape melting and writhing uncontrollably. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet, or one-quarter normal, whichever is less (minimum 5 feet). The victim becomes blinded and cannot cast spells or use magic items, and searing pain renders it incapable of attacking. While in this form, the creature has immunity to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks due to its amorphous nature. A conscious victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a new save in any later round. Success ends the spell effect. Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state, it takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the victim's Wisdom is reduced to 0, it falls unconscious.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Corpse Candle.MOD					DESC:The ghostly hand carries a lit candle that sheds light in a 5-foot radius. You can move the hand at the beginning of your turn as you desire-forward or back, up or down, straight or around corners-up to 50 feet per round. Directing the candle is a free action. The hand and candle are incorporeal and can pass through objects. A corpse candle illuminates hidden, ethereal, and invisible beings and items, all of which become faintly visible as wispy outlines. Ethereal creatures remain unreachable from the Material Plane (except with force effects), but illuminated incorporeal and invisible creatures do not benefit from concealment, and so attacks against them suffer no miss chance. The hand cannot be attacked or damaged, though dispel magic and similar spells can dispel it. The hand winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range. Material Component: A piece of a corpse untreated by any kind of preservative.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Corrosive Grasp.MOD				DESC:A touch attack with this hand causes 1d8 points of acid damage. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level. You can also deal this damage as extra damage with an unarmed strike or an attack with a natural weapon. If you grapple an opponent, you can deal this damage in addition to other damage you deal with a successful grapple check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Countermoon.MOD					DESC:This spell forces a lycanthrope back to its natural form and keeps it from changing form, preventing both voluntary shapechanging through the alternate form ability and involuntary shapechanging because of lycanthropy. Material Component: A hair, scale, or other cast-off item from the type of creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crabwalk.MOD					DESC:When the subject of this spell charges, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll and takes no penalty to Armor Class. This benefit replaces the normal +2 bonus on attack rolls and -2 penalty to AC that a charge attack normally confers. If the creature is capable of multiple attacks after a charge, such as a lion with the pounce ability, the bonus applies only to the first attack. Material Component: A crab's leg.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crawling Darkness.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a number of tentacles that surround you but do not interfere with your movement or spellcasting. They provide concealment and completely hide your features. You gain a +4 competence bonus on grapple checks, Climb checks, and Escape Artist checks. When you are attacked, the tentacles strike back at your attacker. They have an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + your Wis modifier, and a successful attack deals 1d12 points of damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Creaking Cacophony.MOD				DESC:The sound from this spell is as loud as a pitched battle and is audible far beyond the spell's area. Outside the spell's area, the sound is merely loud. Inside the spell's area, the sound is overwhelming. All creatures within the spell's area take a -4 penalty on Listen checks. Spellcasters are distracted and must make a Concentration check to cast any spell (DC equals this spell's DC + the level of the spell being cast). A creaking cacophony spell enhances and focuses sonic energy. Creatures in the area that do not have immunity to sonic damage gain vulnerability to sonic damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Create Magic Tattoo.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a single magic tattoo. You determine the exact type of tattoo, though the selection is limited by your caster level, as indicated below. You must possess a modicum of artistic talent to sketch the desired tattoo-at least 1 rank of Craft (drawing), Craft (painting), Craft (calligraphy), or a similar Craft skill. Inscribing a magic tattoo requires a successful Craft check. The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as noted below. If you are a 3rd- to 6th-level caster, you can inscribe a tattoo that generates any one of the following effects (Craft DC 10). . +2 resistance bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). . +1 luck bonus on attack rolls. . +1 deflection bonus to AC. At 7th to 12th caster level, you can add the following tattoos to the list that you can inscribe (Craft DC 15). . +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. . +2 competence bonus on attack rolls. When your caster level reaches 13th, you can add the following to the list of tattoos you can inscribe (Craft DC 20). . Spell resistance equal to 10 + 1 per three caster levels. . +2 enhancement bonus to any one ability score. . +1 spellcaster level. This effect increases the subject's effective level, but not the total number of spells. For example, an 11th-level caster who receives this tattoo functions as a 12th-level caster for the purpose of determining level-based spell variables (such as range, area, effect, and so on), but he does not receive any extra spells. A single creature can have only three magic tattoos at a time. Any attempt to apply more than that automatically fails. A successful erase spell removes a single magic tattoo. A successful dispel magic spell can remove multiple magic tattoos if targeted on the creature bearing them. Material Components: Tattoo inks in appropriate colors costing at least 100 gp. Focus: Tattoo needles.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Creeping Cold.MOD					DESC:The subject takes 1d6 cumulative points of cold damage per round (that is, 1d6 on the 1st round, 2d6 on the second, and 3d6 on the third). Only one save is allowed against the spell; if successful, it halves the damage each round. Focus: A small glass or pottery vessel worth at least 25 gp filled with ice, snow, or water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Creeping Cold (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell is the same as creeping cold, but the duration increases by 1 round, during which the subject takes 4d6 points of cold damage. If you are at least 15th level, the spell lasts for 5 rounds and deals 5d6 points of cold damage. If you are at least 20th level, the spell lasts for 6 rounds and deals 6d6 points of cold damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Critical Strike.MOD				DESC:Whenever you make a melee attack against a flanked foe or against a foe denied its Dexterity bonus, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, your weapon's threat range is doubled (as if under the effect of keen edge), and you gain a +4 insight bonus on rolls made to confirm critical threats. The increased threat range granted by this spell doesn't stack with any other effect that increases your weapon's threat range. Creatures immune to extra damage from sneak attacks are immune to the extra damage dealt by your attacks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crown of Glory.MOD				DESC:You are imbued with an aura of celestial authority, inspiring awe in all lesser creatures that behold your terrible perfection and righteousness. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma for the duration of the spell. In addition, the subject creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 20).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crumble.MOD						DESC:You bring the forces of erosion to bear on a fabricated structure such as a stone bridge, a wooden building, an iron wall, a construct, or any other object not formed by nature itself. The erosion deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to the object (hardness does not apply) to a maximum of 10d8. The maximum size of the object affected depends on your level. If you cast this spell on an object of greater size than you can affect, the spell fails. Level Size of Object Affected Up to 9th Large 10th-15th Huge 16th-18th Gargantuan 19th-20th Colossal|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Curse of Ill Fortune.MOD			DESC:You place a temporary curse upon the subject, giving it a -3 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. Curse of ill fortune is negated by any spell that removes a bestow curse spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Curse of Ill Fortune (Mass).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like curse of ill fortune, except that it affects multiple enemies.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Curse of Impending Blades.MOD			DESC:The target of the spell has a hard time avoiding attacks, sometimes even seeming to stumble into harm's way. The subject takes a -2 penalty to AC. The curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. Arcane Material Component: A nail through a piece of leather.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Curse of Impending Blades (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like curse of impending blades, except that it affects multiple enemies.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Curse of Lycanthropy.MOD			DESC:If the target fails its saving throw, it dies, and 1d6 wererats (in wererat form; MM 173) claw their way out of its body. The wererats do not attack you or your allies, but might attack nearby living creatures. If no target is available, the wererats scurry away to spread their lycanthropy. Material Component: A pint of animal blood.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cursed Blade.MOD					DESC:A weapon affected by this spell deals wounds that can't be healed in the usual fashion. Any damage dealt by the weapon (not including damage from special weapon properties such as flaming, holy, wounding, and so on) cannot be cured by any means until the damaged individual has received a remove curse spell (or some other effect that neutralizes a curse). If a creature is slain by a weapon that is under the effect of this spell, it can't be raised from the dead unless a remove curse spell (or similar effect) is cast on the body or a true resurrection spell is used.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cutting Hand.MOD					DESC:You alter the structure of your hand so that it becomes as hard and sharp as a blade. Your hand deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small, and 1d8 if you are Large) and gains a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. You are considered armed with this hand. Your hand's enhancement bonus does not apply to melee touch attacks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Cyclonic Blast.MOD				DESC:You send a twisting torrent of wind, not unlike a tornado turned on its side, toward your enemies. A cyclonic blast deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6 points of damage) to all creatures and objects in the area. Objects bigger than Large take half damage. The cyclonic blast begins at your fingertips. Creatures who fail their Reflex saving throws against a cyclonic blast are additionally in danger of being knocked back by the force of the wind. Treat this as a bull rush attack made with a +12 bonus on the Strength check. The cyclonic blast always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and (unlike a normal bull rush) you can exceed your normal movement limit with a sufficiently high check result. Airborne creatures are treated as if they were one size category smaller for the purpose of resisting the bull rush. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier by the blast shatters or breaks through it, the cyclonic blast can continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does. Focus: A child's spinning top.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Daggerspell Stance.MOD				DESC:While this spell is in effect, if you make a full attack while holding a dagger in each hand, you gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made with daggers in that round. The magical energy that permeates your daggers while this spell is active allows you to deflect the magical energy of spells. When wielding two daggers and fighting defensively, you gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your caster level. The spell focuses your concentration so that when you devote all of your attention to defense, you can turn the force of most blows away from your body with your daggers. When wielding two daggers and using the total defense action, you gain both the spell resistance benefit described above and damage reduction 5/magic. Focus: A pair of daggers.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dance of the Unicorn.MOD			DESC:You surround yourself with a purifying, swirling mist that washes the air clean of smoke, dust, and poisons. Nonmagical contaminants, including inhaled poisons, are automatically negated within the cloud. Dance of the unicorn also grants everyone within the mist a +4 bonus on saving throws against magical or supernatural gas effects, such as acid fog, cloudkill, and green dragon breath. The cloud of mist leaves everything within its area damp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dark Way.MOD					DESC:You create a ribbonlike, weightless, unbreakable bridge. A dark way must be anchored at both ends to solid objects, but otherwise can be at any angle. Like a wall of force (PH 298), it must be continuous and unbroken when formed. It is typically used to cross a chasm or a hazardous space. Creatures can move on a dark way without penalty, since it is no more slippery than a typical dungeon floor. A dark way can support a maximum of 200 pounds per caster level. Creatures that cause the total weight on a dark way to exceed this limit fall through it as if it weren't there. You never fall through a dark way unless your own weight exceeds the spell's maximum capacity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Darkbolt.MOD					DESC:You unleash beams of darkness from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. You can hurl one bolt for every two caster levels you have (maximum seven bolts). You can hurl all the bolts at once, or you can hurl one bolt per round as a free action, starting in the round when you cast the spell. You do not have to hurl a bolt in every round, but if you don't hurl the bolt you were entitled to in a round, it is lost. If you hurl all the bolts at once, all your targets must be within 60 feet of each other. A darkbolt deals 2d8 points of damage to a living creature, and the creature is dazed for 1 round unless it makes a Will save (a creature struck by multiple bolts during the same round is dazed for a maximum of 1 round, no matter how many times it fails its save). An undead creature takes no damage, but is dazed if it fails its save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Darkfire.MOD					DESC:Dark flames appear in your hand. You can hurl them or use them to touch enemies. The flames appear in your open hand and harm neither you nor your equipment. They emit no light but produce the same amount of heat as an actual fire. Beginning the following round, you can strike opponents with a melee touch attack, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you make a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. The darkfire is invisible to normal vision but can be seen with darkvision as easily as a normal flame can be seen in darkness (this means that darkfire can be used as a signal or beacon for creatures with darkvision). The spell does not function underwater.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Darkvision (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like darkvision (PH 216), except that all target creatures receive the spell's benefits. Unlike with darkvision, recipients of this spell cannot have the ability made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A dried carrot or three small agates.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dawn.MOD						DESC:All sleeping creatures in the affected area awaken. Those who are unconscious because of nonlethal damage wake up and are staggered. This spell does not affect dying creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dead End.MOD					DESC:This spell flawlessly disguises the spoor left by the subjects, concealing their tracks, scent, and other signs of their passage with an illusion that defeats even the senses of taste and touch. Any creature making a Search check, using the scent ability, or using the Survival skill to track a creature affected by this spell interacts with the illusion and can make a Will save to disbelieve. Creatures that succeed on the save can detect the subjects normally. Creatures merely passing through an area the subjects passed through do not count as interacting with the illusion. Targets of this spell can make a Will save to negate it, and spell resistance applies. Material Component: A pinch of some odoriferous spice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deadfall.MOD					DESC:Pick a point on the ground as the center of the radius and bottom of the cylinder. Deadfall creates a tangled mass of huge branches, logs, and fallen trees on the ground. The deadfall immediately collapses in on itself with terrific force and noise. Creatures and objects in the area take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). In addition, creatures in the area must succeed on a Reflex save or be knocked prone. Once you cast the spell, a considerable volume of dead wood remains behind. This pile of brush is 5 feet high, with a 20-foot radius, and it counts as dense rubble (DMG 90).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deafening Clang.MOD				DESC:You empower the touched weapon with magic that causes it to emit a loud clang when it is struck against a hard surface, such as a floor, wall, or creature. The weapon deals 1d6 points of sonic damage with each successful hit, and any creature struck by the weapon must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Death Armor.MOD					DESC:The black flames created by this spell injure creatures that contact them. Any creature striking you with its body or handheld weapons takes 1d4 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). If the creature has spell resistance, it applies to the damage. Weapons with reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. Material Component: Paste made from ground bones. Focus: An onyx worth 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Death Dragon.MOD					DESC:The cocoon created by this spell gives you a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor and a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. You are treated as armed when you make unarmed attacks, and you deal damage as if your limbs were short swords of an appropriate size. You can use your off hand to attack, incurring the standard two-weapon fighting penalties (PH 160). The cocoon prevents you from casting spells with somatic, material, or focus (but not divine focus) components, but does not otherwise hinder your actions or movement. As a standard action, you can project a cone of fear or make a melee touch attack to use inflict critical wounds on the creature touched (the caster level of these effects equals your own). These effects are otherwise identical to the spells of the same names, but have saving throw DCs equal to what this spell's save DC would be if the spell allowed a save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Death Pact.MOD					DESC:This spell allows the target to enter into a binding agreement with your deity that brings the target back to life if it is slain. When this spell is cast, the subject's Constitution is permanently lowered by 2 points. In exchange for this, if the subject should die, a true resurrection spell (PH 296) is immediately cast upon the subject. However, the resurrected creature does not regain the 2 Constitution points when returned to life. If the spell is dispelled before the subject dies, it does not regain its 2 lost Constitution points. A wish or miracle spell can return the lost Constitution, but only after the death pact has been activated or dispelled. Material Component: A diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Death Throes.MOD					DESC:If you are killed, your body is instantaneously destroyed in an explosion that deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to everyone in a 30-foot-radius burst. This explosion destroys your body, preventing any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. A wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore life.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Death Ward (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like death ward (PH 217), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Decomposition.MOD					DESC:Whenever an enemy within the area takes normal (not nonlethal) damage, that wound festers for an additional 3 points of damage at the beginning of its turn each round thereafter for the duration of the spell. A DC 15 Heal check or the application of any cure spell or other healing magic stops the festering. Only one wound festers at a time; additional wounds taken while the first is still festering are not subject to this effect. Once festering has been stopped, however, any new wound taken while the subject is within the area (before the spell expires) begins the process anew. For example, a subject who takes 6 points of damage from an attack while within the area of a decomposition spell takes 3 points of damage from the festering wound in the next round, and another 3 points in the round after that. In the following round, that subject receives 4 points of healing from a cure light wounds spell, so the festering stops and the subject takes no festering damage that round. In the next round, the subject remains within the emanation and takes another 3 points of damage in battle. The festering begins again, dealing 3 points of festering damage in the following round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Decoy Image.MOD					DESC:In order to flush ambushes, you project a duplicate image of yourself and your companions. This spell creates an illusion complete with visual images, sounds (including speech), smells, textures, and temperature. It mimics exactly what you and any of your allies within 50 feet of you do. If the terrain differs significantly between that of the illusion and that of the characters, or if any character takes an action the illusion can't duplicate (for instance, climbing a tree if none are present for the illusory duplicate to mimic) onlookers automatically receive a saving throw. In addition, anyone who moves out of the spell's area disappears from the illusion.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deep Breath.MOD					DESC:Your lungs instantly fill with air, and continue to refill with air for the duration of the spell. When the spell's duration expires, you can continue to hold your breath as if you had just gulped down a lungful of air. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself from drowning after being suddenly plunged into water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deeper Darkvision.MOD				DESC:The subject gains the ability to see 90 feet in total darkness and ignores the 20%% miss chance normally present in shadowy illumination (such as might be created by a darkness spell). Deeper darkvision is black and white only but otherwise similar to normal sight. Material Component: A pinch of dried carrot or an agate.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Defenestrating Sphere.MOD			DESC:When you cast this spell, you create a violently swirling sphere of air. As a move action, you can make the sphere travel up to 30 feet per round and strike a creature or object you indicate as a ranged touch attack. Any creature struck by the sphere takes 3d6 points of damage from the force of its winds. In addition, Medium or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Creatures that fall prone must then succeed on a second Fortitude save or be swept up by the sphere and driven 1d8?10 feet into the air, dropping 1d6 squares from their original position in a random direction and taking falling damage as normal. If a window is within range, the subject is automatically thrown in that direction. If some obstacle prevents the subject creature from reaching its expelled height, it takes 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet of movement it was unable to complete, so that a creature hurled 50 feet up in a room with a 20- foot ceiling would take 3d6 points of damage from the impact, then take 2d6 points of damage when it falls back to the ground. The sphere can affect a maximum of one creature or object per round, and winks out if it exceeds the spell's range. Focus: A gray pearl worth at least 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dehydrate.MOD					DESC:You afflict the target with a horrible, desiccating curse that deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage, plus 1 additional point of Constitution damage per three caster levels, to a maximum of 1d6+5 at 15th level. Oozes, plants, and creatures with the aquatic subtype are more susceptible to this spell than other targets. Such creatures take 1d8 points of Constitution damage, plus 1 additional point of Constitution damage per three caster levels, to a maximum of 1d8+5.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Deific Vengeance.MOD				DESC:This spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6), or 1d6 points per caster level (maximum 10d6) if the target is undead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Delay Death.MOD					DESC:The subject of this powerful spell is unable to die from hit point damage. While under the protection of this spell, the normal limit of -9 hit points before a character dies is extended without limit. A condition or spell that destroys enough of the subject's body so as to not allow raise dead to work, such as a disintegrate effect, still kills the creature, as does death brought about by ability score damage, level drain, or a death effect. The spell does not prevent the subject from entering the dying state by dropping to -1 hit points. It merely prevents death as a result of hit point loss. If the subject has fewer than -9 hit points when the spell's duration expires, it dies instantly.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Delay Disease.MOD					DESC:The progress of any nonmagical disease that already afflicts the target is halted for the duration of the spell. Delay disease allows the subject to skip the required saving throw against the disease for the day that the spell is in effect. During this period, the subject accrues no further ability damage from the disease. A skipped saving throw counts as neither a success nor a failure for the purpose of recovery from the disease. Furthermore, the incubation period of any disease to which the subject is exposed during the spell's duration does not begin until the spell expires. Delay disease does not cure any damage that a disease might already have dealt, and it has no effect on magical or supernatural diseases.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Delusions of Grandeur.MOD			DESC:This powerful phantasm fools the subject into believing itself more competent and safe than it really is. The spell makes any action the subject considers attempting seem easily accomplished, requiring only a token effort. Deadly wounds seem like mere scratches, stalwart foes appear weak and intimidated, and the subject's own attacks seem stronger and more effective. As a result of its skewed perceptions, the subject takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to Wisdom. This penalty cannot reduce the subject's Wisdom below 1. Finally, the subject becomes so completely enamored with its own (false) abilities that it cannot fight defensively or take the total defense action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Demon Dirge.MOD					DESC:Demon dirge deals 2d6 points of damage each round for the duration of the spell to any creature that has both the chaotic and evil subtypes (such as a howler or a demon). No saving throw is allowed against this damage. If the target creature also possesses the tanar'ri subtype (MM 316), the spell has a much more powerful effect. In addition to the damage, a tanar'ri is stunned for the duration of the spell unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Demonhide.MOD					DESC:The subject gains damage reduction 5/cold iron or good.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Desiccating Bubble.MOD				DESC:A globe of supernaturally dry air rolls in whichever direction you point and engulfs those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round and can leap up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d4 points of damage as it evaporates moisture from the subject. (The subject can negate this damage with a successful Reflex save.) Oozes, creatures composed of water (such as water elementals), and creatures with the aquatic subtype take 2d6 points of damage. The bubble moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest. The surface of the bubble has a spongy, yielding consistency (similar to that of a soap bubble, but not fragile and allowing objects to pass through it without affecting the spell) and so does not cause damage except by absorbing moisture. It cannot batter down large obstacles. The bubble winks out if it exceeds the spell's range. Arcane Material Component: A tiny bag or bladder filled with air, and a sprinkle of dust.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Detect Favored Enemy.MOD			DESC:You can sense the presence of a favored enemy. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of a favored enemy in the area. 2nd Round: Types of favored enemies in the area and the number of each type. 3rd Round: The location and HD of each individual present. Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks detection.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Devil Blight.MOD					DESC:This spell deals 2d6 points of damage per round for the duration of the spell to creatures that have both the lawful and evil subtypes (such as a barghest or a devil). No saving throw is allowed against this damage. If the target creature also possesses the baatezu subtype (MM 306), it must succeed on a Fortitude save or be stunned for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Diamondsteel.MOD					DESC:Diamondsteel enhances the strength of one suit of metal armor. The armor provides damage reduction equal to half the AC bonus of the armor. This damage reduction can be overcome only by adamantine weapons. For example, a suit of full plate would provide damage reduction 4/adamantine, and a +1 breastplate (+6 AC) would provide damage reduction 3/adamantine. Material Component: Diamond dust worth at least 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dimension Door (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like dimension door (PH 221), except as noted above and that you can transfer the targets once per round, up to a distance of 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels, as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dinosaur Stampede.MOD				DESC:Creatures in the spell's area take 1d12 points of damage +1 point per caster level (up to +20). Creatures more than 10 feet above the ground are not affected by dinosaur stampede. With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the spectral forms move along the ground up to 40 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). Creatures cannot be damaged more than once per round by dinosaur stampede. Material Component: A fossil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dire Hunger.MOD					DESC:The spell's subject becomes maddened by terrible pangs of hunger, viewing all creatures as food sources. The subject creature gains a new bite attack that does damage according to the creature's size: Fine 1 Diminutive 1d2 Tiny 1d3 Small 1d4 Medium 1d6 Large 1d8 Huge 2d6 Gargantuan 2d8 Colossal 4d6 The subject creature adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to this damage. If the creature already has a bite attack that deals more damage, use that damage value instead. The subject creature eschews all other attacks or actions except for its new bite attack, but it defends itself normally. It moves to attack the nearest living creature it can get to and attacks this creature until it is dead or until another living creature is closer. The subject creature attacks whatever living creature is nearest, regardless of former allegiance or personal connection. If moving toward the nearest living creature would move the creature into a dangerous area (precarious footing, a huge fire, or a deadly trap is in the way) the subject creature moves around the hazard if it can or moves to attack another creature if moving around the hazard isn't possible. If such movement brings the subject creature closer to another living creature, it attacks that creature instead. If the subject of the spell cannot detect or get to a living creature nearby, it goes looking for one to attack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dirge.MOD						DESC:Your song draws the energies of death and destruction down on your enemies. Each round, any enemy in the area takes 2 points of Strength and Dexterity damage. Subjects can attempt a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage, but a successful save does not prevent damage in future rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dirge of Discord.MOD				DESC:Creatures affected by this spell take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and Dexterity, a 50%% reduction in their speed (to a minimum of 5 feet), and must make a Concentration check to cast any spell (DC equal to this spell's DC + the level of the spell being cast). Material Component: A pinch of ashes from a destrachan.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Discern Shapechanger.MOD			DESC:By taking a standard action to concentrate, you can see the true form of creatures within 60 feet. Each round, you can examine one creature you can see to determine whether it is polymorphed, disguised, or transmuted, and what its true form is. If you look at a shapechanger in its true form, you immediately sense its shapechanging ability, but you can't determine what other forms it might be capable of assuming. For the purpose of this spell, a shapechanger is any creature with the shapechanger type or a supernatural or extraordinary ability that allows it to assume an alternate form. A wizard who knows alter self is not a shapechanger (since a spell is not a supernatural or extraordinary ability), but a barghest is (since it has the supernatural ability to assume alternate forms, even though its type is outsider). Material Component: A balm of honey and lotus flower costing 25 gp, smeared on your eyelids.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Discolor Pool.MOD					DESC:This spell causes a color pool on the Astral Plane-an irregular patch of color containing a portal to another plane-to appear to be a different color, and thus, to lead to another plane. True seeing or analyze portal reveals the true nature of the pool. Material Component: Four drops of colored ink.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Disguise Undead.MOD				DESC:You make one undead-including its clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment- look different. You can make it seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change the creature's body type. For example, a wight could look human, humanoid, or like any other generally humanshaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature, such as a mole or a beard, or make it look like an entirely different creature. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. It does not alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of the undead or its equipment. A battleaxe made to look like a dagger still functions as a battleaxe. This spell also foils magical means of detecting undead. The subject of disguise undead detects as a creature of the type simulated. Creatures get Will saves to recognize the glamer as an illusion if they interact with the subject (such as by touching the undead and having that not match what they see, in the case of this spell). Focus: A cocoon of a death's head moth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dispel Ward.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like dispel magic (PH 223), except that it can be used only in the targeted or area version, and it affects only abjuration magic placed upon objects or areas (such as arcane lock, explosive runes, fire trap, glyph of warding, and guards and wards.) The maximum bonus on the level check is +10.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dispelling Breath.MOD				DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, your breath weapon acts as a targeted dispel magic (PH 223). For each creature or object that fails its saving throw against your breath weapon and that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the highest level spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + the spell's caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell or until you fail all your checks. A creature's magic items are not affected, and creatures and objects that rolled successful saving throws against your breath weapon are likewise not affected. If a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by monster summoning), is in the area and fails its saving throw against your breath weapon, you can also make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature (returning it whence it came). For each ongoing area or effect spell centered within the area of your breath weapon, you make a dispel check to dispel the spell. Spells are dispelled prior to the effect of your breath weapon being resolved. You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell in the area that you have cast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dispelling Screen.MOD				DESC:Any spell effect operating on a creature or unattended object that passes through the screen is affected as by a targeted dispel magic (PH 223) at your caster level. Attended items that pass through are not affected by the screen, which is the only way the screen differs from a normal targeted casting of dispel magic-attended items are essentially not targeted by the screen. Make a caster level check (1d20 + 1 per caster level, maximum +10) to dispel spell effects (DC 11 + caster level) or suppress an unattended object's magical properties for 1d4 rounds (DC equal to the item's caster level). Spell effects not operating on objects or creatures cannot pass through the screen. A disintegrate or successful dispel magic removes dispelling screen, while an antimagic field suppresses it. Material Component: A sheet of fine lead crystal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dispelling Screen (Greater).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like dispelling screen, except that the maximum caster level bonus on the dispel check is +20.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Displacer Form.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a displacer beast (MM 66). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to magical beast, and your size changes to Large. You have the space and reach of a displacer beast (15 feet/5 feet [10 feet with tentacles]). You gain two tentacle attacks, which each deal 1d6 points of damage + your Str modifier. You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution of an average displacer beast (Str 18, Dex 15, Con 16), but you retain your own mental ability scores. Your base land speed becomes 40 feet. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You also gain low-light vision. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base saving throw bonuses all remain the same. You lose any spell-like abilities of your own form, and you lose any extraordinary special abilities from your own form. You retain any supernatural abilities of your own form. You keep all extraordinary special attacks derived from class levels (such as a barbarian's rage or a rogue's sneak attack), but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. You can speak and cast spells while in displacer beast form, but you must physically touch any necessary material components. Your natural armor bonus becomes +5, regardless of any natural armor bonus from your normal form. While in displacer beast form, you gain the displacer beast's displacement and resistance to ranged attacks abilities. Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional. Material Component: A single claw from a displacer beast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Disquietude.MOD					DESC:The affected subject restricts its movement to avoid any physical contact, even with allies. Any ally that wishes to touch the subject must make a successful melee touch attack to do so. The subject must stay 15 feet away from all other creatures. If, at the beginning of its turn, the creature is within 15 feet of any creature, it must first move away (beyond 15 feet from any creature) before taking any action. If the subject cannot safely move that distance, it instead must take the total defense action and remain in its space.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Disrupt Undead (Greater).MOD			DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. This spell functions like disrupt undead (PH 223), except that this ray deals 1d8 points of damage per caster level to any undead, to a maximum of 10d8. If the damage is sufficient to destroy the first target, then you can redirect the ray to another undead target within 15 feet of the first target. If you make a successful ranged touch attack on the second target, that target takes half of the damage rolled for the first target.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dissonant Chant.MOD				DESC:You create a distracting and discordant chant. Affected creatures that attempt spellcasting or other activities that require concentration must make Concentration checks (DC equal to this spell's DC + the level of the spell being cast). The DCs of activities that already require Concentration checks, such as casting defensively, increase by 4. Creatures within the area gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against language-dependent effects.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dissonant Chord.MOD				DESC:Creatures (other than you) in the affected area take 1d8 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Distort Speech.MOD				DESC:For the duration of this spell, the subject has a 50%% chance to miscast spells that have verbal components, and any time the subject speaks (including the use of magic items activated by command words), there is a 50%% chance that the utterance is completely incomprehensible and therefore ineffective.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Distract.MOD					DESC:The targets of this spell must succeed on a Will save or lose themselves to the urge to experience nearly everything. Failure indicates the creatures take a -4 penalty on all Concentration, Listen, Search, and Spot checks, and can take only a single standard or move action each round, but not both. Creatures with more than 6 HD are unaffected.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Distract Assailant.MOD				DESC:A creature affected by this spell is flat-footed until the beginning of its next turn. Material Component: The dried wing of a fly.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Distracting Ray.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. This ray attempts to undo magic as it is being cast. Used in the same manner as a counterspell (as a readied action), the ray interferes with the manipulation of divine or arcane magic by dazzling the target. If the ray successfully strikes a spellcaster, and that spellcaster is in the process of casting a spell, then the target spellcaster must make a Concentration check to avoid losing the spell. The DC of the Concentration check is equal to 17 + the level of the spell the target is casting.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divine Agility.MOD				DESC:You grant the subject a +10 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divine Insight.MOD				DESC:Once during the spell's duration, you can choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to 5 + your caster level (maximum bonus of +15) on any single skill check. Activating the effect requires an immediate action. You must choose to use the insight bonus before you make the check you want to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one divine insight effect active on you at the same time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divine Interdiction.MOD				DESC:This spell can be cast at a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be cast on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. A creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell, and spell resistance, if any, applies if the spell is cast on a creature. Divine interdiction interferes with a cleric's connection to her divine source of power, resulting in a temporary loss of the ability to turn or rebuke creatures and loss of granted domain powers. Paladins, blackguards, and other classes capable of rebuking and turning also suffer a temporary loss of this ability. This affects the subject's ability to channel energy through the use of a turn or rebuke attempt, and so also interferes with the use of many divine feats.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divine Protection.MOD				DESC:Allies gain a +1 morale bonus to their Armor Class and on saving throws.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Divine Sacrifice.MOD				DESC:Your first attack each round for the duration of the spell deals an extra 5d6 points of damage if it hits, and you take 10 points of damage each time you make such an attack, whether or not the attack is successful.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dolorous Blow.MOD					DESC:For the duration of the spell, the weapon's threat range is doubled, and its critical threats automatically confirm, so every threat is a critical hit. The latter effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits. Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as this spell and the Improved Critical feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Doomtide.MOD					DESC:Creatures within the area must make Will saves or be dazed for 1 round. Any creature moving into the mist, or a creature that begins its turn in the mist, must succeed on a Will save or also be dazed for 1 round. The mist filling the area obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment. When you cast the spell, you decide if the effect remains stationary or if its point of origin moves straight away from you at a rate of 10 feet per round. A moderate wind disperses the effect in 4 rounds; a strong wind disperses the mist in 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Downdraft.MOD					DESC:Downdraft sends a column of turbulent air rushing toward the earth. Airborne creatures caught in the area of a downdraft must succeed on a Reflex save or immediately plummet up to 100 feet straight downward, taking falling damage (1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen) if the downdraft makes them hit the ground or collide with an object. Those who succeed on the Reflex save plummet only 50 feet. Creatures already on the ground must succeed on a Reflex save or be knocked prone by the spell. Material Component: A balsa-wood bird carving, which is crushed underfoot.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Draconic Might.MOD				DESC:The subject of the spell gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution, and Charisma. It also gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Finally, it has immunity to magic sleep and paralysis effects. Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dragon Ally.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like lesser dragon ally, except you can call a single dragon of up to 18 HD. XP Cost: 250 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dragon Ally (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like lesser dragon ally, except you can call a single dragon of up to 22 HD. XP Cost: 500 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dragon Ally (Lesser).MOD			DESC:This spell calls a dragon. You can ask the dragon to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the dragon to bargain for its services. The summoned dragon requires payment for its services, which takes the form of coins, gems, or other precious objects the dragon can add to its hoard. This payment must be made before the dragon agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. Tasks requiring up to 1 minute per caster level require a payment of 50 gp per HD of the called dragon. For a task requiring up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 250 gp per HD. Long-term tasks (those requiring up to 1 day per caster level) require a payment of 500 gp per HD. Especially hazardous tasks require a greater gift, up to twice the given amount. A dragon never accepts less than the indicated amount, even for a nonhazardous task. At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for elapses, the creature returns to the place it was called from (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible). XP Cost: 100 XP. Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dragonbreath.MOD					DESC:You gain the ability to breathe a gout of energy as a standard action that mimics a dragon's breath. Once you've used the breath attack, you must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so again. When you cast dragon breath, you choose one true dragon whose breath you're emulating. If you choose a chromatic dragon, then the spell gains the evil descriptor. If you choose a metallic dragon, then it gains the good descriptor. Particulars for the breath weapons of each of the true dragons are provided below. Chromatic Dragons Black: 30-ft. line of acid, 1d8/2 caster levels (maximum 10d8); Reflex half. Blue: 30-ft. line of electricity, 1d8/2 caster levels (maximum 10d8); Reflex half. Green: 15-ft. cone of acid, 1d8/2 caster levels (maximum 10d8); Reflex half. Red: 15-ft. cone of fire, 1d8/2 caster levels (maximum 10d8); Reflex half. White: 15-ft. cone of cold, 1d8/2 caster levels (maximum 10d8); Reflex half. Metallic Dragons Brass: 15-ft. cone of sleep, lasts 1d6 rounds; Will negates. Bronze: 30-ft. line of electricity, 1d8/2 caster levels (maximum 10d8); Reflex half. Copper: 15-ft. cone of slow, lasts 1d6 rounds; Will negates. Gold: 15-ft. cone of fire, 1d8/2 caster levels (maximum 10d8); Reflex half. Silver: 15-ft. cone of paralysis, lasts 1d6 rounds; Fort negates. Arcane Material Component: A dragonscale of the appropriate color.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dragonsight.MOD					DESC:You gain the visual acuity of a dragon, including low-light vision, darkvision, and blindsense. You can see four times as well as a normal human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light. Your darkvision is effective out to 10 feet per caster level. You take half the normal penalties for distance on Spot checks. Your blindsense has a range of 5 feet per caster level. None of these effects stack with any low-light vision, darkvision, or blindsense you might already have. Focus: A dragon's eye.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dragonskin.MOD					DESC:Your skin toughens and becomes scaly like that of a chromatic dragon, of a color that you select. You gain an enhancement bonus to natural armor equal to +1 per two levels (to a maximum of +5 at 10th level), as well as energy resistance 10 against the type of energy appropriate to the color you select: acid (black or green), cold (white), electricity (blue), or fire (red). Your energy resistance increases to 20 at 10th level. Material Component: A dragon's scale. Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Dream Casting.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like dream (PH 225), except as noted above and that you can alter the sleeping person's dreams to produce a specific desired effect. The dreamer gets a Will saving throw to resist the additional effects of this spell; if the save succeeds, the dream casting spell can send only a message, in the manner of the dream spell. If the saving throw fails, you decide what additional effect the message carries. Fear: Your image in the dream is surrounded by intimidating imagery and an aura of power. For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he is shaken. This is a compulsion and fear effect. Charm: Your image in the dream appears particularly helpful and kind. For the duration of the spell, the dreamer is under the effect of a charm monster spell. This is a charm effect. Rage: Your image in the dream taunts and harasses the dreamer. For the duration of the spell, any time the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he preferentially attacks you if in a combat situation. The dreamer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls when attacking you while under this effect. This is a compulsion effect. Harrow: Your image in the dream behaves in a bizarre and irrational manner. For the duration of the spell, the dreamer behaves in an unusual manner, gaining two random traits from Table 4-24: One Hundred Traits (DMG 128), rerolling any results not pertinent to behavior. If the dreamer can see you or knows you are present, he is confused for 1 round/level.  Dreamsight.MOD	DESC:You fall into a deep sleep while your spirit leaves your body invisibly in incorporeal form and travels to distant locations. Your spirit can move 100 feet per round, and can see and hear anything you could if you were in the same location. The spirit can be blocked by any spell that wards incorporeal creatures, and it can be detected and attacked in the same way as incorporeal creatures can. Your spirit can do nothing but move and observe-it cannot speak, attack, cast spells, or perform any other action. At the end of the spell, your spirit instantaneously returns to your body and you wake up. If your body is disturbed or attacked while your spirit is wandering, the spell ends immediately.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Drown.MOD						DESC:You create water in the lungs of the subject, causing it to begin drowning (DMG 304) as if it had failed to continue holding its breath. The subject's hit points immediately drop to 0, and it falls unconscious. In the next round, it loses another hit point (bringing its hit points to -1) and is dying. In the following round, it dies. Coughing and other attempts by the subject to physically expel the water from its lungs are useless. However, another creature can stabilize the subject by making a DC 15 Heal check on the creature before it dies. Undead, constructs, creatures that do not need to breathe, and creatures that can breathe water are unaffected by this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Drown (Mass).MOD					DESC:This spell functions like drown, except that it affects multiple creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Duelward.MOD					DESC:While a duelward spell is in effect, counterspelling is an immediate action for you, allowing you to counterspell even when it is not your turn without having previously readied an action. You also gain a +4 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify spells being cast. The first time you successfully counterspell while the spell is in effect (whether you counterspell as an immediate action or not), duelward is discharged. Material Component: A miniature silk glove.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earth Lock.MOD					DESC:You cause a 1-foot length of subterranean tunnel to constrict, "locking" it against others who might wish to traverse its length. This spell affects only naturally occurring tunnels or worked tunnels that are surrounded on all sides by unworked, natural, subterranean earth. You can affect any tunnel whose diameter does not exceed 10 feet. A square-sided or rough tunnel can also be affected, as long as its diameter at the point where the spell is cast does not exceed 10 feet. The constriction takes 1 round to complete. Any Large or smaller object or creature that partially blocks the constriction point is pushed, unharmed, to one side or the other. (A creature can decide which way to move; an object moves randomly.) A Huge or larger object or creature that blocks the constriction point prevents the spell from working until moved. You can freely pass through tunnels that you have secured with this spell. (The constriction opens and closes on your command, taking 1 round for either process). A tunnel secured with earth lock can be bypassed by others in several ways. A DC 20 Escape Artist check allows the creature making the check to squeeze through the constriction but leaves it intact. A DC 25 Strength check breaks the constriction and ends the spell. A successful dispel magic or knock spell opens the constriction-the former by ending the spell and the latter by suppressing it for 10 minutes. If a creature burrows through the earth lock, the spell ends. The constricted tunnel can also be dug out normally. Identifying a tunnel secured with earth lock (as opposed to a tunnel that just ends) requires a DC 20 Search check. Material Component: A diamond chip worth at least 50 gp, embedded in a piece of charcoal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earth Reaver.MOD					DESC:Creatures and objects within the area take 4d6 points of damage from the impact of the rock shards, as well as 3d6 points of fire damage; no saving throw applies to the damage. Creatures in the area must also succeed on a Reflex saving throw or be knocked prone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earthbind.MOD					DESC:You hinder the subject creature's ability to fly (whether through natural or magical means) for the duration of the spell. If the target fails its saving throw, its fly speed (if any) becomes 0 feet. An airborne creature subjected to this spell falls to the ground as if under the effect of a feather fall spell. Even if a new effect would grant the creature the ability to fly, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the earthbind spell. Earthbind has no effect on other forms of movement, or even on effects that might grant airborne movement without granting a fly speed (such as jumping or levitate or air walk spells).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earthen Grace.MOD					DESC:You grant the subject an affinity for earth and stone. Any damage the subject takes from a stone or earthen source counts as nonlethal damage for the duration of the spell. Natural attacks by creatures made of earth or stone (such as stone golems), natural attacks by creatures of the earth subtype, and attacks by stone weapons (such as a stone hammer or a sling stone) instead deal nonlethal damage, as does falling damage when the subject lands on rock or earth. When the nonlethal damage the subject has taken (from any source) equals the subject's current hit points, the spell ends, and any further damage from a stone or earthen source causes damage normally. Material Component: A chunk of granite.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earthen Grasp.MOD					DESC:You bring forth from the ground an arm made of dense, compacted earth or soil that can grapple your foes. You can cause the arm to rise only out of earth, mud, grass, or sand, and the spell fails if you attempt to cast it in an area with the wrong materials (including stone). Treat the arm as a Medium creature, with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength of 14 +2 per three caster levels (16 at 3rd level, 18 at 6th level, and so on). The arm doesn't move from the square it appears in, but can make one grapple attempt per round against any creature in its square or any adjacent square. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the arm can target multiple creatures, you choose one. If you are unable to choose a target, the arm attacks a random creature within reach (possibly including your allies). Each round when it successfully pins a target, the hand deals lethal damage equal to 1d6 points + its Str modifier. The earthen arm has AC 15, hardness 4, and 3 hit points per caster level. If reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to dust. Material Component: A miniature hand sculpted from clay.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Earthfast.MOD					DESC:You reinforce a rock formation or stone structure. The earthfast spell doubles the structure's hit points and increases its hardness to 10. This spell does not function on constructs.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Easy Climb.MOD					DESC:You create a path of handholds and footholds up the surface of a cliff face, tree trunk, wall, or other vertical obstacle. This effect changes the surface to the equivalent of a very rough wall (Climb DC 10).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Easy Trail.MOD					DESC:Anyone in the area of the spell (including you) finds the undergrowth held aside while they pass. This effect essentially provides a trail through any kind of undergrowth, and you treat any trackless terrain as having a trail (PH 164). Once the effect of the spell passes, the plants return to their normal shape. The DC to track anyone who traveled within the area of this spell increases by 5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail). This spell has no effect on plant crea-tures (that is, they aren't pushed or held aside by its effect).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ebon Eyes.MOD					DESC:The subject of this spell gains the ability to see normally in natural and magical darkness, although it does not otherwise improve the subject's ability to see in natural dark or shadowy conditions. The subject ignores the miss chance due to lack of illumination other than total darkness. While the spell is in effect, a jet-black film covers the subject's eyes, a visual effect that gives the spell its name. Material Component: A pinch of powdered black gemstone of any type.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Echo Skull.MOD					DESC:You can see, hear, and speak through a tiny dried animal skull at any distance. As long as you and the skull remain on the same plane, you can see and hear as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch your perception from its location to your own or back again as a free action. Focus: A tiny dried animal skull.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ectoplasmic Armor.MOD				DESC:The subject of the spell gains a +5 armor bonus to AC, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every four caster levels you have (maximum +9 bonus at 16th level). This armor bonus applies only against incorporeal touch attacks. All other attacks ignore the armor bonus from ectoplasmic armor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ectoplasmic Feedback.MOD			DESC:Any creature that hits you with an incorporeal touch attack takes 1d6 points of force damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Effulgent Epuration.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you bring forth one floating, silvery sphere per caster level, each about the size of your head. These spheres hover around you to provide protection from magical effects. As a standard action, you can shift the spell's effect (and thus all the spheres) to any other creature within range. You can shift the effect once per round. Each of these spheres can absorb and completely negate any spell or spell-like ability, regardless of level, that directly targets the subject. The spheres do not automatically absorb all spells; the subject can choose whether or not to let them absorb any given spell cast upon it. (This option allows the creature to benefit from helpful spells.) Area spells and spells that do not actually have a target cannot be absorbed. Once a sphere has absorbed a spell or spell-like ability, it simply fades away. Only spells and spell-like abilities of deific power can overcome the protection provided by effulgent epuration.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Electric Jolt.MOD					DESC:You release a small stroke of electrical energy. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The spell deals 1d3 points of electricity damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Electric Loop.MOD					DESC:You create one small stroke of lightning that targets one creature per three caster levels you possess (maximum four creatures). Each target must be in a square adjacent to another target. The spell deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to each target. A creature that fails its Reflex save must make a successful Will save or be stunned for 1 round. Material Component: A loop of copper wire and a magnet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Elemental Body.MOD				DESC:You can transform your body into a particular type of elemental substance. You and your possessions appear to be made of that element, though in the same general shape and size as your normal appearance. You gain the following abilities when you cast elemental body: . You have the benefits of the attune form spell (page 17) with respect to the appropriate element. If you choose a water body, for example, you can breathe normally on waterdominant planes. . You are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning, and are not subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. . Your creature type remains unchanged, so you are unaffected by spells that target elementals, but you gain the air, earth, fire, or water subtype depending on the elemental substance you chose. In addition, you gain the following exceptional abilities according to the element chosen: Air: Fly at your normal speed (perfect maneuverability), air mastery (airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls against you). Earth: Earth mastery (you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both you and your foe touch the ground), push (you can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity), +3 natural armor bonus to AC. Fire: Fire immunity, burn (those you hit in melee and those who attack you with natural weapons must make a Reflex save or catch fire, with a save DC equal to that of a fire elemental of the same size). Water: Swim at your normal speed, water mastery (you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both you and your opponent touch water), drench (you can use your elemental form to put out nonmagical open flames and dispel magical fire you touch as if casting dispel magic at your caster level). The elemental body spell has the descriptor of the element you choose. So, if you choose a body of fire, elemental body is a fire spell. Material Component: A bit of the element in question from a plane other than the one where the spell is being cast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Embrace the Wild.MOD				DESC:Upon casting the spell, you gain the senses of animal creatures. You gain low-light vision and either blindsense out to 30 feet or scent (your choice). You also gain a +2 bonus on Listen and Spot checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Emerald Flame Fist.MOD				DESC:One of your hands bursts into an aura of brilliant emerald flame, shedding light equal to that of a torch. With a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The creature you touch is engulfed by the fiercely hot aura of flame. Each round at the beginning of its turn, the creature is allowed a Fortitude save to prevent further damage, but on a failed save the creature is still engulfed in the flaming aura and again takes 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20). An engulfed creature that fails its Fortitude save can use a full-round action to attempt a DC 15 Reflex save, which extinguishes the flames and ends the spell. You can use this spell to attack an object. Nonmagical, unattended objects are automatically engulfed in green flame and take 3d6 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level each round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energized Shield.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like lesser energized shield, except that the energy resistance is 10 and damage dealt is 2d6.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energized Shield (Lesser).MOD			DESC:When this spell is cast, the shield touched appears to be made entirely out of one type of energy (fire, cold, electricity, acid, or sonic). Whoever bears the shield gains resistance 5 against the chosen energy type. Additionally, if the wielder successfully hits someone with the shield with a shield bash attack, the victim takes 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage in addition to the normal shield bash damage. The energy type must be chosen when the spell is cast and cannot be changed during the duration of the spell. The energy resistance overlaps (and does not stack) with resist elements. A given shield cannot be the subject of more than one lesser energized shield or energized shield spell at the same time. The descriptor of this spell is the same as the energy type you choose when you cast it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Ebb.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like enervation (PH 226), except the creature struck gains negative levels over an extended period. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If the attack succeeds, the subject initially gains one negative level, then continues to gain another negative level each round thereafter as its life force slowly bleeds away. The drain can be stopped only by a successful DC 23 Heal check or the application of a heal, restoration, or greater restoration spell. Each round after the first, on your turn, the affected creature can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to end the effect. If you strike an undead creature, that creature gains 4d4?5 temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Immunity.MOD				DESC:This abjuration grants a creature and its equipment complete immunity to damage from one of the five energy types-acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Energy immunity absorbs only hit point damage, so the recipient could still suffer side effects such as drowning in acid, being deafened by a sonic attack, or becoming immobilized in ice (and thus helpless). Energy immunity overlaps protection from energy and resist energy. As long as energy immunity is in effect, the other spells absorb no damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Spheres.MOD				DESC:You create a circle of five colored spheres that orbit your head at a distance of 1 foot. These spheres provide as much light as a torch and can be used offensively or defensively. Each sphere corresponds to one of the five types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic). If used to attack, on your turn as a standard action you can direct one or more spheres to strike a creature or creatures in range, no two of which are more than 30 feet apart. Each sphere deals 5 points of energy damage per five caster levels (maximum 20 points of damage) to a single creature, so an 11th-level caster's sphere deals 10 points of energy damage. The subject can make a Reflex save for half damage against each sphere. If you are attacked with an effect that causes energy damage, and the sphere of that type of energy is still present, you can have that sphere absorb some of that energy damage. Each sphere grants you energy resistance 5 per five caster levels. If a sphere is used to absorb damage, that sphere is destroyed. When used to attack a creature with spell resistance, make one spell resistance roll for all spheres that attack the target in a round. Success or failure applies to all spheres striking the creature that round. Material Component: Five glass marbles.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Transformation Field.MOD		DESC:You create a lingering zone of transformative magic that absorbs magic energy from magic items or spellcasting and uses it to power another spell tied to that location. For example, you could have an energy transformation field tied to a summon monster V spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic. The field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Supernatural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast fireball spell or a charge from a wand of fireball would add three spell levels to the field's store, a potion of cure light wounds would add one, and a wish from a ring of three wishes would add nine. Items that don't have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so an immovable rod would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its levitate prerequisite). Effects that are absorbed give no indication of where the magic went; they simply vanish. The field absorbs only magic that is actually used within its area. Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a continual flame would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected. An energy transformation field has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field's concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field. Typical spells linked to an energy transformation field are blindness/deafness, fireball, suggestion, summon monster, or wall of force. Spells that have a costly material component or an XP cost cannot be linked to a field, but those with a costly focus can if the focus object is present within the field (typically sealed into a wall or in a secret compartment). Only Mordenkainen's disjunction, limited wish, wish, or similar spells can destroy the energy transformation field. Spells of lower level, such as dispel magic and greater dispel magic, are absorbed by it, and an antimagic field prevents it from absorbing magical energy within the field but does not otherwise hamper this spell. If two or more field spells share an overlapping area, each field has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area. Material Component: Three drops of your blood, an eye from any humanoid, and 5,000 gp worth of powdered diamond. XP Cost: 250 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Energy Vortex.MOD					DESC:When you cast energy vortex, you choose one of four energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. A blast of that energy type bursts in all directions from you, dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20) to nearby creatures other than you. If you are willing to take the damage yourself, you deal twice as much damage. You don't get a Reflex save, but spell resistance applies, as do any resistances and immunities you have to the energy type. The descriptor of this spell is the same as the energy type you choose when you cast it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enervating Breath.MOD				DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you can modify your breath weapon so that it is laced with negative energy. In addition to the normal energy damage your breath weapon deals, creatures that fail their saving throws against the breath weapon gain 2d4 negative levels. If the subject gains at least as many negative levels as it has Hit Dice, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from her highest available level. Assuming the subjects survive, they regain lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level. Ordinarily, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the subject's level, but the negative levels from enervating breath don't last long enough to do so. If an undead creature is caught within the breath weapon, it gains 2d4?5 temporary hit points before taking damage from the breath weapon. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enhance Familiar.MOD				DESC:You infuse your familiar with vigor, granting it a +2 competence bonus on saves, attack rolls, and melee damage rolls, as well as a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enhance Wild Shape.MOD				DESC:This spell infuses your wild shape ability with magical energy, magnifying and enhancing its power. The type of enhancement must be chosen at the time the spell is cast and cannot be changed once the spell is in effect. The next time you activate your wild shape ability (during the duration of enhance wild shape), this spell enhances your new form in the way you selected. The enhancement to your wild shape remains as long as you stay in that form (or until the spell's duration expires) but does not apply to your next wild shape form. If you do not activate your wild shape ability during the duration of enhance wild shape, the spell has no effect. You select one of the following enhancements when you cast this spell. . Assume the form of a plant with your next wild shape. . Gain the extraordinary abilities of the new form. . The new form assumed is stronger than normal and gains a +2 bonus to Strength. . The new form assumed is more agile than normal and gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity. . The new form assumed is healthier than normal and gains a +2 bonus to Constitution. A druid can be affected by more than one enhance wild shape spell at a time, but a different wild shape enhancement must be chosen each time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enlarge Person (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like enlarge person (PH 226), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enrage Animal.MOD					DESC:Enrage animal affects only creatures of the animal type and bestows a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to Armor Class. This effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's rage (PH 25), except that the animal is not fatigued at the end of the rage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Entangling Staff.MOD				DESC:Each time you successfully strike a foe with the staff (a normal melee attack), you deal normal damage and can attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. This grapple attempt does not require a separate touch attack. You gain a +8 bonus on grapple checks you cause by striking a foe with the entangling staff. You can attempt to grapple creatures up to one size category larger than you. If your grapple check succeeds, your quarterstaff's vines constrict your foe, dealing 2d6 points of damage (you can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead of normal damage if you wish). You then have two choices: Release: You release your opponent from the grapple. Some vines remain clinging to your foe, leaving it entangled for the duration of the spell. You can attack different enemies in later rounds with the staff, potentially grappling and constricting or entangling them. Maintain: You maintain your hold. In subsequent rounds, you deal constriction damage with a successful grapple check. You can then choose to release or maintain the hold again. Focus: A quarterstaff.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Entice Gift.MOD					DESC:Entice Gift.MOD	DESC:You enchant a creature so that it feels suddenly compelled to give you what it is holding when you cast this spell. On the creature's next action, it moves as close to you as it can get in a single round and offers you the object as a standard action. This spell allows you to act out of turn and accept the "gift" if the creature reaches you to hand you the object (assuming you have a free hand and can accept it). The subject defends itself normally and acts as it wishes on subsequent rounds, including attempting to get the object back if desired. If the subject is prevented from doing as the spell compels, the spell has no effect. For example, if the subject is paralyzed and cannot move or drop the item, nothing happens.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Enveloping Cocoon.MOD				DESC:A cocoon of force encloses a creature of size Large or smaller, containing it for the spell's duration or until the cocoon is destroyed. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 10 hit points per caster level. The enveloping cocoon prevents the creature trapped inside from moving or casting spells with somatic components. The cocoon is too confining to permit effective attacks with anything larger than a natural or light weapon (and the creature inside can attack only the cocoon in any event). You can attach a second spell to the cocoon by casting it at the cocoon. When the enveloping cocoon spell ends or is dismissed, the attached spell automatically affects the creature inside, with no save allowed (although spell resistance, if any, still applies). If the cocoon is destroyed before it is dismissed or the spell duration ends, the attached spell is wasted. Any of the following spells from this book can be attached to an enveloping cocoon: infestation of maggots, languor, miasma, and phantasmal disorientation. In addition, a cocoon can be used in conjunction with these spells from the Player's Handbook: baleful polymorph, blight, contagion, dominate animal, flame strike, and poison (the subject fails the initial save but can attempt the second save). Material Component: A live caterpillar.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Eradicate Earth.MOD				DESC:A shock wave radiates from you, seismically damaging all nearby creatures that have the earth subtype. Any such creature that is within the area of the spell takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). Material Component: A small stone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Essence of the Raptor.MOD			DESC:Your physical appearance does not change. Your speed increases to 60 feet (if it is already 60 feet or faster, it does not change), and you gain a +8 bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen, Spot, and Survival checks. You also gain the scent ability (MM 314).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ethereal Breath.MOD				DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you can modify your breath weapon to manifest on the Ethereal Plane instead of on the Material Plane. (You must be on the Material Plane, or on another plane with a coexistent Ethereal Plane, for this spell to function.) Your breath weapon affects ethereal creatures as if they were material, and does not affect material creatures in its area.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ethereal Chamber.MOD				DESC:You create a translucent prison of pure crystalline force around a target on the Ethereal Plane. You must be able to see or otherwise target the creature you wish to affect. The subject affected by the chamber cannot move on either the Ethereal Plane or its coterminous planes for the duration of the spell but is otherwise unaffected. The subject cannot move onto another plane while inside the chamber, including the Material Plane. The subject within the crystalline prison cannot make physical attacks or be attacked and is unaffected by most spells and supernatural abilities. Gaze attacks and sonic spells function through the walls of the crystalline prison, but a creature within the chamber gains a +2 bonus on saving throws. The target of ethereal chamber can break the crystalline prison by making a Strength check (DC 10 + caster level). A disintegrate spell destroys an ethereal chamber. Material Component: A piece of translucent glass.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ethereal Mount.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like phantom steed (PH 260), except as noted here. You call into being one or more quasi-real mounts. These mounts accept only you and those that you designate as riders. The mounts appear as horses or any other commonly ridden mounts, but they have a foggy, almost translucent nature, and their colors shift across the spectrum over time. These mounts have AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex), and hit points equal to 10 + your caster level. They do not fight and have no attacks. If reduced to 0 hit points, an ethereal mount melts into the ethereal fog from which it came. An ethereal mount has a speed of 240 feet on the Ethereal Plane and can carry its rider's weight plus 10 pounds per level. (If the Deep Ethereal is used in your cosmology, then the amount of time to reach destinations is halved while on an ethereal mount.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Evil Glare.MOD					DESC:Immediately upon completion of the casting of this spell, you target a living creature within range with your glare; that creature becomes paralyzed with fear for 1d8 rounds. You must be able to see the creature, and it must be able to see you (though it need not meet your gaze). Once per round after that for the duration of the spell, you can target another creature with your glare as a standard action. You can't target the same creature twice with a single casting of the spell, regardless of the outcome of its saves.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Exacting Shot.MOD					DESC:All rolls made to confirm critical threats by the target weapon against your favored enemies automatically succeed, so every threat is a critical hit. The affected weapon also ignores any miss chance due to concealment whenever you fire at a favored enemy (unless the target has total concealment, in which case the normal miss chance applies). If the ranged weapon or the projectile fired has any magical effect or property related to critical hits, this spell has no effect on it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Excavate.MOD					DESC:As with passwall (PH 259), this spell allows you to create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or harder materials. If a wall's thickness is more than 1 foot per caster level, then a single excavate spell simply makes a niche or short tunnel with the stated dimensions. Several excavate spells can be used in succession to breach very thick walls by forming a continuing passage. Unlike passwall, excavate is an instantaneous effect that does not end and cannot be dispelled; any passage it creates is permanent. Material Component: A pinch of excavated earth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Expeditious Retreat (Swift).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like expeditious retreat (PH 228), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Explosive Cascade.MOD				DESC:You create a path of flame when you cast this spell. Anything along this path takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures and objects it touches. The flame lights up the area as if it were a torch, and small sparks and decaying flames remain in the area for 1 round, shedding light as candles but dealing no damage. A creature or object can be affected only once by each casting of this spell. If the damage from the flame destroys an interposing barrier, the flame can move beyond the barrier if it has area remaining. Material Component: Bat guano, sulfur, and copper packed into a metal tube with one closed end.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Extend Tentacles.MOD				DESC:This spell lengthens your tentacles, increasing the reach of your tentacle attacks by 5 feet. The tentacles attack as normal. If you do not already have tentacles, the spell has no effect on you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Extract Water Elemental.MOD			DESC:This brutal spell causes the targeted creature to dehydrate horribly as the moisture in its body is forcibly extracted through its eyes, nostrils, mouth, and pores. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage on a successful Fortitude save. If the targeted creature is slain by this spell, the extracted moisture is transformed into a water elemental of a size equal to the slain creature (up to Huge). The water elemental is under your control, as if you summoned it, and disappears after 1 minute. This spell has no effect on living creatures with the fire subtype.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Eye of the Hurricane.MOD			DESC:With this spell, you create a swirling miniature storm that provides a measure of protection, but leaves you and those near you unaffected. The storm that surrounds you has hurricane-force winds spinning in a circle with you at the center. Normal ranged attacks through the hurricane's windy area are impossible, and even heavier projectiles such as siege weapons and giant boulders take a -8 penalty on the attack roll. Creatures who move inside the spell's area suffer effects depending on their size and whether they're airborne. Each creature must make a saving throw at the beginning of its turn or when it enters the affected area. Medium or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked 1d4?10 feet away from the eye of the hurricane's center and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet traveled in this manner. Creatures blown away are knocked prone as well. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6?10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. Large creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone by the force of the wind. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6?10 feet. Huge creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be checked. Flying creatures are instead blown back 1d6?5 feet. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures can move through the spell's area without adverse consequences. Even creatures that succeed on their saving throws must attempt them again whenever they start a turn inside the spell's area or whenever they move back into it. The spell's area is effectively a sphere. Although the area is centered on you, you're not within the wind. If you move, the eye of the hurricane moves as well to keep you in the center. If you cast eye of the hurricane so that creatures are inside the eye when the spell begins, they must make Fortitude saves when your movement brings the area of wind upon them. Thereafter, if you move the spell area into a square occupied by another creature, that creature makes a Fortitude save at the beginning of its next turn (assuming the windy area of the spell is still on it).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Eye of Power.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like arcane eye (PH 200), except as noted here. You can cast any spell of 3rd level or lower that has a range other than personal through the eye. Any spell so cast functions as though it had been cast from the eye's location rather than yours. Casting any spell of higher than 3rd level through the eye not only produces no effect (though the spell is still expended), but it destroys the eye of power and ends the spell. Unlike an arcane eye, an eye of power is visible and corporeal, so it can be destroyed. The eye is a Fine object with AC 18 and 77 hit points. It uses your save bonuses for saving throws. Material Component: A bit of bat fur.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Eyes of the King.MOD				DESC:You summon four fiendish dire bats (MM 62) that blaze with a faint ghoulgreen light (they glow as bright as a candle). These fiendish dire bats have damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 9; and a smite good attack that provides a +4 bonus on one damage roll. The bats allow you to see through their eyes, from their perspective, using your own visual senses. If you have darkvision, low-light vision, or spells cast that enhance your visual senses, such as true seeing or see invisibility, you continue to gain the benefit of those abilities or spells through the eyes of your bat minions. The bats also give you the benefit of their blindsense ability for the purpose of viewing their surroundings for the duration of the spell. You can summon the bats at any point you can see, but they can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. Even while outside your line of sight, they follow your mental directions on where to explore. The dire bats travel together, never separating by more than 40 feet. They fly with a speed of 40 feet if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or at half speed (speed 20 feet) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. The bats can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. You must concentrate to control the dire bats. If you do not concentrate, the bats move to attack the closest active creature. Once concentration lapses, the spell ends 5 rounds later. Material Component: A bit of bat fur.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Faith Healing.MOD					DESC:When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (up to +5). The spell works only on a creature that worships the same deity as you. A target with no deity or a different deity from yours is unaffected by the spell, even if the target would normally be harmed by positive energy.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
False Gravity.MOD					DESC:The subject of this spell can travel on any solid surface as though that surface possessed its own gravity. For example, the subject could walk or even run up a wall as though the wall were a perfectly level floor. The subject can switch "down" as often as it likes during the spell's duration, though only once per round, as a free action. Unattended objects fall, as normal. The subject of false gravity can fly by choosing a solid surface and letting itself fall through the air toward it. A character "flying" in this fashion moves at 30 feet per round and can make one turn, in any direction, once per round, by redefining its personal gravity. A creature falling in this fashion loses all "downward" momentum when it changes its gravity. Material Component: A pair of magnets.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Familiar Pocket.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, a garment or container becomes a safe haven for a Tiny or smaller familiar. The spell turns the target pocket into a comfortable extradimensional space (about 1 cubic foot). The familiar can fit inside the space without creating any noticeable bulge in the item. Whenever the familiar is touching you, you can whisk it inside the space as a free action by speaking a command word chosen by you when the spell is cast. If the familiar can speak, it can command itself inside. As a free action, you can call the familiar forth or it can leave the space on its own. Once inside, the familiar has total cover and total concealment, and as a free action, you or the familiar can further seal the space to make it airtight and waterproof. The air supply inside the sealed space lasts for 1 hour, but with the pocket unsealed, the familiar can remain inside indefinitely. The familiar cannot attack or cast spells from within the space, but can use supernatural or spell-like abilities as normal (provided they don't require line of sight, which the pocket blocks). You continue to gain the special ability granted by your familiar. While inside the pocket, the familiar continues to benefit from the share spells ability as if it were adjacent to you. The spell ends if the familiar pocket is placed within or taken into another extradimensional space (such as a portable hole). If your familiar is within the pocket when the spell duration expires or if the spell ends abnormally (as above), the familiar appears in your space unharmed. Material Component: A tiny golden needle and a strip of fine cloth given a half twist and fastened at the ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fangs of the Vampire King.MOD			DESC:You grow vampirelike fangs that allow you to make bite attacks as a natural attack. Your bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage + your Str modifier, and 1 point of Constitution damage. If you make a full attack with other weapons, you can make a bite attack as a natural secondary attack (-5 penalty on the attack roll).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fantastic Machine.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a bizarre, but useful, machine that you can command to perform any simple, physical task that can be described in twenty-five words or less. You can order the machine to perform the same task over and over, but you can't change the task. You must specify the task when you cast the spell. The machine always acts on your turn in the initiative order. (It can act during the turn you cast the spell.) The machine functions as a Large animated object (MM 13). It trundles over the ground at a speed of 40 feet. It can swim or fly at a speed of 10 feet (clumsy). It has 22 hit points, AC 14 (-1 size, +5 natural), and hardness 10. Its saving throw modifiers are Fortitude +1, Reflex +1, Will -4. The machine has a Strength of 16. A light load for the machine is up to 172 pounds; a medium load is 173-346 pounds; and a heavy load is 347-520 pounds. The machine can fly or swim only when lightly loaded. The machine can lift a weight of up to 1,040 pounds to a height of 15 feet. It can push or drag 2,600 pounds. It can excavate 7,000 pounds of loose rock each minute (which is sufficient to clear a 5-by-5-by-5-foot space in 3 rounds). It can excavate sand or loose soil at twice that rate. The machine has an attack bonus of +5 and can make one slam attack each round that deals 1d8+4 points of damage. It deals triple slam damage (3d8+12) against stone or metal. The machine can hurl Small rocks (if any are at hand) with an attack bonus of +3. Its range increment is 150 feet, and it can throw a rock up to 10 range increments. A thrown rock deals 2d6+4 points of damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fantastic Machine (Greater).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like fantastic machine, but you can concentrate on controlling the machine's every action or specify a simple program, such as to collect all the logs in an area and stack them in a neat pile, plow a field, drive piles, or the like. The machine can perform only fairly simple physical tasks. Directing the machine's actions or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The machine always acts on your turn in the initiative order. (It can act during the turn you cast the spell.) Except where noted below, the machine functions as a Large animated object (MM 13) constructed from adamantine. It trundles over the ground at a speed of 60 feet. It can swim or fly at a speed of 20 feet (poor). It has 16 HD, 88 hit points, AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural), and hardness 20. Its saving throw modifiers are Fortitude +5, Reflex +5, and Will +0. The machine has a Strength of 22. A light load for the machine is up to 346 pounds, a medium load is 347-692 pounds, and a heavy load is 693-1,040 pounds. The machine can fly or swim only when lightly loaded. The machine can lift a weight of up to 2,080 pounds to a height of 15 feet. It can push or drag 5,200 pounds. It can excavate 20,000 pounds of loose rock each minute (which is sufficient to clear a 5-by-5-by-5-foot space in 1 round). It can excavate sand or loose soil at twice that rate. The machine makes slam attacks with an attack bonus of +17/+12 for 1d8+9 points of damage. It deals triple slam damage (3d8+27) against stone or metal. The machine can hurl Small rocks (if any are at hand) with an attack bonus of +12/+7. Its range increment is 150 feet, and it can throw a rock up to 10 range increments. A thrown rock deals 2d6+9 points of damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Favor of the Martyr.MOD				DESC:The subject gains immunity to nonlethal damage, charm and compulsion effects, and attacks that function specifically by causing pain, such as the wrack spell (see page 243). It is further immune to effects that would cause it to be dazed, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned. The subject remains conscious at -1 to -9 hit points and can take a single action each round while in that state, and does not lose hit points for acting. If any of the above conditions were in effect on the subject at the time of casting, they are suspended for the spell's duration. (Thus, an unconscious subject becomes conscious and functional.) When the spell ends, any effects suspended by the spell that have not expired in the interim (such as the fatigued condition, which normally requires 8 hours of rest to recover from) return. Effects that expired during the duration of this spell do not resume when it ends. In addition to these effects, the subject gains the benefit of the Endurance feat for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Favorable Sacrifice.MOD				DESC:The subject receives the protection of a divine power commensurate with the value of the expended material component. Only one of the benefits described below applies per casting of this spell; they do not stack. By expending 250 gp, you grant the subject damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic 10; and spell resistance equal to your caster level. By expending 1,000 gp, you grant the subject damage reduction 10/magic; resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic 15; and spell resistance equal to your caster level +5. By expending 10,000 gp, you grant the subject damage reduction 20/magic; resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic 20; and spell resistance equal to your caster level +10. Material Component: Gems worth a total of 250 gp, 1,000 gp, or 10,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fearsome Grapple.MOD				DESC:You grow two tentacles that grant you a +4 circumstance bonus on grapple checks. These tentacles cannot attack, hold objects, manipulate items, or perform any action other than grappling. If your caster level is at least 9th, you grow four tentacles instead, and the circumstance bonus increases to +8.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fell the Greatest Foe.MOD			DESC:The subject gains the ability to deal greater damage against larger creatures. For every size category of an opponent bigger than the subject of the spell, the subject deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack. For example, a Medium creature would deal an extra 1d6 points of damage against a Large creature, 2d6 against Huge, 3d6 against Gargantuan, or 4d6 against a Colossal creature. Material Component: A dragon's claw or a giant's fingernail.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Field of Ghouls.MOD				DESC:Humanoid creatures in the area with -1 to -9 hit points that fail their saving throws die and immediately rise as ghouls (MM 118) under your control. You choose whether the ghouls follow you, or whether they can remain where formed and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) the ghouls notice. The ghouls remain until they are destroyed. The ghouls that you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many ghouls you generate with this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level (this includes undead from all sources under your control). If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (you choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. Creatures that fall to -1 hit points or fewer in the area after the spell is cast are likewise subject to its effect and rise as ghouls on your next turn. No creature can be affected by this spell more than once per round, regardless of the number of times that the area of the spell passes over it. This spell does not affect creatures that are already dead, or creatures that are killed by reducing their hit points to -10.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Field of Icy Razors.MOD				DESC:Razor-sharp ice crystals surround the targets. Each target takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6); half of this damage is cold damage, and half is slashing. In addition, each target's speed is reduced by 20 feet for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that succeed on Reflex saving throws take half damage and their movement is unaffected. Focus: A silver shuriken worth 50 gp that looks like a snowflake.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fiendform.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like alter self (PH 197), except that you can take the form of any fiendish creature, demon, or devil that can be summoned by a summon monster I, II, III, or IV spell (MM 287), regardless of size. You can assume only one form with each use of the spell, but you gain all that form's extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities, and your type changes to outsider. Spells and effects that harm or ward evil outsiders affect you, and any effect that would normally banish an outsider to its home plane instead ends the spell and leaves you dazed for 1 round per caster level. Material Component: A bone from any fiendish creature, half-fiend, demon, or devil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fierce Pride of the Beastlands.MOD		DESC:When the spell is complete, 2d4 celestial lions (MM 274) appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 celestial dire lions (MM 63) appear. Each creature has maximum hit points per Hit Die. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell. A celestial lion called by this spell has damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance 9; and a smite evil attack that provides a +5 bonus on one damage roll. A celestial dire lion called by this spell has damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10; spell resistance 13; and a smite evil attack that provides a +8 bonus on one damage roll. The creatures obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the creatures. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Find the Gap.MOD					DESC:You gain the ability to perceive weak points in your opponent's armor. Your first melee or ranged attack each round is resolved as a touch attack, disregarding the subject's armor, shield, and natural armor bonuses (including any enhancement bonuses) to Armor Class. Other AC bonuses, such as dodge bonuses, deflection bonuses, and luck bonuses, still apply.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Find Temple.MOD					DESC:With this spell, you can easily find a place to worship and possible aid or shelter from the priests within. When the spell is cast, you sense the direction of the nearest temple to your god. If there is none within the spell's area, the spell instead shows you the direction of the nearest temple dedicated to a god of the same alignment as yours. You can also specify a particular temple to search for, but you must have visited the temple personally at some point in the past (seeing the temple through a divination does not count).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fins to Feet.MOD					DESC:This spell transforms tails, tentacles, or finned extremities into humanoid legs and feet. Creatures so affected lose any natural swim speed they possess, but gain a land speed instead. Transmuted Medium creatures have a base land speed of 30 feet, Small and smaller creatures have a base land speed of 20 feet, and Large or larger creatures have a base land speed of 40 feet. The subject loses any natural attacks based on its tail or tentacles.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Shield (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like fire shield (PH 230), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Shuriken.MOD					DESC:This spell creates shuriken formed of magical fire that you can throw as a normal ranged attack. You are automatically considered proficient with the fire shuriken, which have a range increment of 10 feet, threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and deal 3d6 points of fire damage each on a successful hit (although you and your possessions take no damage as the shuriken are thrown). Any additional damage dealt by the fire shuriken (including your Strength bonus and sneak attack damage) is also fire damage. The shuriken disappear when they hit, so they cannot set fire to combustibles or damage objects. You can create one fire shuriken per three caster levels, up to a maximum of six at 18th level. Material Component: A shuriken coated with pine sap and sulfur.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Spiders.MOD					DESC:You call forth a teeming mass of fire elementals the size of common spiders. A creature that starts its turn in the affected area takes 4d6 points of fire damage. Each round, you can use a move action to direct the spiders to move up to 30 feet. If the spiders are left undirected, they move at a speed of 15 feet toward the nearest living creature, if one isn't already in the affected area. As fire elementals, the fire spiders have immunity to fire and are thwarted by barriers that block neutral outsiders. Any cold spell of 3rd level or higher can disperse the fire spiders, ending the spell. Material Component: A pinch of sulfur.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Stride.MOD					DESC:You gain the ability to step into fires and move from one fire to another. The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are. Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not considered "fires" for the purpose of this spell, nor are sources of great heat, such as pools of lava. Once in a fire, you instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft./level) and can transport yourself to one of them. Each transport counts as a full-round action. With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself once per caster level. If a fire's location doesn't offer enough space for you (for example, a fire contained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occupied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don't sense its location. If a fire rests on a surface that can't support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transport yourself to it. For example, if you transport yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there. Fire stride provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fire Wings.MOD					DESC:This spell transforms your arms into wings of brilliant fire. The flame does not damage you or any items you carry. Because your arms are transformed, you cannot hold items in your hands or cast spells that require somatic components, but rings, bracers, and other items worn on your arms when you cast the spell still function normally. The wings allow you to fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor), with good maneuverability. You can charge but not run while flying, and you cannot carry more than a light load aloft. Using a fire wings spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so you can take other actions normally. If the spell duration expires while you are aloft, you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds, then fall the rest of the distance if you haven't already landed. Because dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fire wings spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field. If you are not flying, you can make up to two attacks each round with the fire wings as if they were natural weapons. A successful attack deals 2d6 points of fire damage. The wings can be extinguished (and the spell canceled) by a quench spell, immersion in water, or a wind of hurricane or greater force. Material Component: The feather of a bird, which you must burn when you cast the spell. Focus: A golden amulet shaped like a phoenix (worth 150 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Firebrand.MOD					DESC:Each burst deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within the area. All subjects hit by the burst in the round the spell is cast or within the area in the following round take 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). A character struck in the round the spell is cast can attempt to extinguish the flames on itself as a full-round action with a successful DC 15 Reflex save. Burst effects that overlap do not deal additional damage (a creature can be affected by only one burst). Material Component: A flask of alchemist's fire (worth 20 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fireburst.MOD					DESC:Fireburst causes a powerful explosion of flame to burst from you, damaging anyone within 10 feet of you. All creatures and objects within that area, except for you and any creatures or objects that share your space, take 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d8). Material Component: A bit of sulfur.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fireburst (Greater).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like fireburst, except that it affects creatures within 15 feet of you and deals 1d10 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d10).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fires of Purity.MOD				DESC:The creature you touch bursts into magical flames that do not harm the subject, but are capable of harming anyone else who comes into contact with the creature. With a successful melee attack, the subject deals an extra 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +15). If the defender has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures that make successful melee attacks against the subject are susceptible to the same damage unless they attack with weapons that have reach, such as longspears. The subject of fires of purity takes only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, the subject takes no damage on a successful save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fireward.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like quench (PH 267), except as noted above. In addition, it has the following effects. While fireward remains in effect, no magical fire effect can function inside its area. This effect is similar to that of an antimagic field, but only magical fire is suppressed. Any nonmagical fire created inside or brought into the spell's area is immediately extinguished as well.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fist of Stone.MOD					DESC:You transform one of your hands into a mighty fist of living stone, gaining a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength for the purposes of attack rolls, grapple checks, or breaking and crushing items. In addition, you gain the ability to make one natural slam attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage + your new Strength bonus (or 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus if you make no other attacks in that round). You can make the slam attack as a natural secondary attack with the normal -5 penalty, or a -2 penalty if you have the Multiattack feat (MM 304), as part of a full attack action. However, you cannot gain more than one slam attack per round with this spell due to a high base attack bonus (+6 or higher). Your fist undergoes no change in size or form, remaining as flexible and responsive as it would normally be while under the spell's effect. Material Component: A pebble inscribed with a stylized fist design.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flame Dagger.MOD					DESC:You create a bladelike beam that you can wield as if it were a dagger. Attacks with a flame dagger are melee touch attacks, and the blade deals 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +10). Because the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame dagger can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, cloth, and so on. This spell does not function underwater. Material Component: A candle.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flame of Faith.MOD				DESC:You can temporarily turn any single normal or masterwork melee weapon into a magic, flaming one. For the duration of the spell, the weapon acts as a +1 flaming burst weapon. Material Component: A lump of phosphorus, touched to the target weapon.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flame Whips.MOD					DESC:Your forelimbs transform into flaming whips. You gain two melee touch attacks with a 15-foot reach that each deal 6d6 points of fire damage. Attacks with these flaming whips replace any natural attacks you had with those limbs. While this spell is in effect, you cannot cast spells with material components, nor can you carry items with your forelimbs. Any items worn on your forelimbs cease functioning while the spell is active.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flashburst.MOD					DESC:Flashburst creates a blinding, dazzling flash of light. Sighted creatures within the area are blinded for 2d8 rounds. A successful Will save negates the blindness. Creatures in the area are dazzled for 1 round even if their save was successful. Creatures outside the area, but within 120 feet of the burst, can be blinded for 2d8 rounds if they have line of sight to the burst (Will negates). Creatures outside the burst area are not dazzled. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of sulfur or phosphorus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flensing.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, you literally strip the flesh from a corporeal creature's body, inflicting incredible pain and psychological trauma. Each round, the subject takes 2d6 points of damage, 1d6 points of Charisma damage, and 1d6 points of Constitution damage. A successful Fortitude save negates the ability damage and reduces the hit point damage by half for that round, but does not end the spell. Flensing has no effect on creatures in gaseous form. Material Component: An onion.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fleshshiver.MOD					DESC:A creature with Hit Dice less than or equal to your caster level is automatically stunned for 1 round (no saving throw). A creature with Hit Dice greater than your caster level is allowed a saving throw to negate the stunning effect. In the following round, the target must make a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and be nauseated by the pain for 1d4+2 rounds. Material Component: A bone, which is snapped during the casting of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Flight of the Dragon.MOD			DESC:A powerful pair of wings sprout from your shoulders, granting you a fly speed of 100 feet (average). You can't carry aloft more than a light load. When flying long distances, you can fly at 15 miles per hour (or 24 miles per hour at a hustle). Material Component: A dragon's wing claw. Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Floating Disk (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like Tenser's floating disk (PH 294), except that the created disk does not need to stay within 3 feet of the surface beneath it. However, the disk must remain within 15 feet of you at all times. You can concentrate (as a standard action) on the disk to make it move with a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect). This allows you to sit on the disk and command it to carry you about. Material Component: A drop of mercury.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fly (Mass).MOD					DESC:This spell functions like fly (PH 232), except as noted here. This spell confers the power of flight upon all targeted creatures. Each recipient of the spell must remain within 30 feet of at least one other recipient, or the spell ends for the creature that is separated from the others. If only two individuals are affected, the spell ends for both if the distance between them exceeds 30 feet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fly (Swift).MOD					DESC:Fly (Swift).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like fly (PH 232), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Focusing Chant.MOD				DESC:You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Foebane.MOD						DESC:When you cast this spell, choose one of your favored enemies. Against creatures of the selected enemy kind, the weapon acts as a +5 magic weapon and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. Furthermore, while you wield the weapon, you gain a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against effects created by creatures of that kind. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand for any reason. You cannot have more than one foebane weapon active at a time. If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Force Chest.MOD					DESC:This spell brings into being a lidded box of force. The box appears in your hands, and you can choose to make it either invisible or merely translucent. The chest has no weight worth noting. Solid walls of force form the chest's five sides and lid. You and other creatures cannot open the lid except by first speaking the password (determined by you at the time of casting). Both objects and Tiny and smaller creatures can fit in the box; it holds enough air to supply one Tiny, two Diminutive, or four Fine creatures for 1 hour. Like a wall of force spell, a force chest is immune to damage of all kinds and resists dispel magic, but it is susceptible to disintegrate and Mordenkainen's disjunction, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation. The box is a spell effect, and Open Lock and Use Magic Device cannot open it. Material Component: A 2-inch-square glass cube.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Force Claw.MOD					DESC:This spell brings into being a lidded box of force. The box appears in your hands, and you can choose to make it either invisible or merely translucent. The chest has no weight worth noting. Solid walls of force form the chest's five sides and lid. You and other creatures cannot open the lid except by first speaking the password (determined by you at the time of casting). Both objects and Tiny and smaller creatures can fit in the box; it holds enough air to supply one Tiny, two Diminutive, or four Fine creatures for 1 hour. Like a wall of force spell, a force chest is immune to damage of all kinds and resists dispel magic, but it is susceptible to disintegrate and Mordenkainen's disjunction, and it can be destroyed by a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation. The box is a spell effect, and Open Lock and Use Magic Device cannot open it. Material Component: A 2-inch-square glass cube.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Force Ladder.MOD					DESC:You create an immobile transparent ladder made of force. The ladder is 2 feet wide and anywhere from 10 to 60 feet long, with rungs spaced 1 foot apart. The ladder functions as a normal ladder and can support any weight. It can be destroyed by anything that destroys a wall of force. Focus: A miniature silver ladder (50 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Force Missiles.MOD				DESC:You create powerful missiles of magical force, each of which darts from your fingertips and unerringly strikes its target, dealing 2d6 points of damage. The missile then explodes in a burst of force that deals half this amount of damage to any creatures adjacent to the primary target. The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee or has anything less than total cover or concealment. A caster cannot single out specific parts of a creature. The spell can target and damage unattended objects. You gain one missile for every four caster levels. You can make more than one missile strike a single target, if desired. However, you must designate targets before rolling for spell resistance or damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Forceward.MOD					DESC:You create an unmoving, transparent sphere of force centered on you. The sphere negates force effects and provides an impassable barrier against incorporeal creatures. Spells with the force descriptor do not affect anything within the sphere, and any force spell that overlaps the area, such as wall of force, is automatically countered. Incorporeal creatures, or creatures with the force descriptor must make a Will save to enter the area of the sphere. Forceward does not push a creature out of the way if you move toward an incorporeal creature or force effect, and such creatures are treated as if they automatically succeeded on their saving throws against this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Forcewave.MOD					DESC:This spell initiates a bull rush against all creatures within 10 feet. The forcewave has a +10 bonus on the bull rush attempt. All creatures are pushed to the extent of the bull rush result, and the result of the bull rush can push creatures beyond the spell's normal range. Focus: A small piece of string and a drop of water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Forestfold.MOD					DESC:You change your coloring and attune your footfalls to one specific kind of terrain (aquatic, desert, plains, forest, hills, mountains, marsh, or underground). While you are in terrain of that kind, you gain a +10 competence bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. You retain these bonuses even if you leave the designated terrain and return within the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fortify Familiar.MOD				DESC:This spell makes your familiar tougher, granting it 2d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor. It also has a 25%% chance to avoid extra damage from sneak attacks or critical hits (although such attacks still deal normal damage if successful). Temporary hit points gained in this fashion last for up to 1 hour.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fortunate Fate.MOD				DESC:You surround the subject with an aura that immediately heals the creature if it is subjected to an effect that would kill it (reduce its hit points to -10 or below). When this event occurs, the fortunate fate spell intervenes by immediately triggering a heal spell upon the target. If the effect is one that causes harm in a way that a heal spell can repair (disease, hit point damage, ability damage, or poison), the target does not actually die, saved by the heal. If the effect is one that heal cannot countermand (such as ability drain, old age, negative levels, disintegration, ability drain, or death effects), the fortunate fate spell cannot prevent the creature's death.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Foundation of Stone.MOD				DESC:As long as they do not move and remain standing on solid ground, the subject creatures gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +4 bonus on Strength checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped. If this spell is cast in mountainous terrain, the bonus on Strength checks granted by this spell increases to +6.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Freeze.MOD						DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A target struck takes 2d6 points of cold damage. A creature struck must succeed on a Reflex save or be encased in a 5-inch-thick sheath of ice and be immobilized (and thus helpless). A creature encased in ice takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round until freed. A target encased in ice is aware and breathes normally but cannot speak or move other than to attempt to escape by making a Strength check (see below). It can still execute purely mental actions, such as using a spell-like ability. A spellcaster can cast a spell with no verbal or somatic component as long as the spell lacks a focus or material component, or the material component, focus, or divine focus is already in the spellcaster's hand. The ice blocks line of effect. A winged creature cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim but, because ice floats, the encased swimmer will rise to the surface and bob about. A DC 22 Strength check breaks the ice, freeing the encased creature. Creatures other than the target can also attack the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 15 hit points. When the duration of the spell expires, the ice melts and the encased creature is freed. Damage that would harm the creature must first deal enough damage to destroy the ice before the creature takes damage, and damage dealt to the ice is subtracted from damage that would be dealt to the creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Freezing Fog.MOD					DESC:A bank of freezing mist billows out from the point you designate, obscuring all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment, while creatures farther away have total concealment. Each round on your turn, the frigid mist deals 1d6 points of cold damage to each creature and object within it. The fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a maximum speed of 5 feet (regardless of its normal speed) and takes a -2 penalty on melee attack rolls and damage rolls and a -6 penalty on ranged weapon attack rolls (but not ranged spell attack rolls). A creature or object that falls into the fog from above is slowed, so that each 10 feet of mist it passes through effectively reduces overall falling damage by 1d6. Freezing fog also coats all solid surfaces in its area with a slick, icy rime, and on your turn each round, each creature in the area of the fog must make a successful Reflex save or fall prone. A creature that manages to stand must make a DC 10 Balance check in order to move, falling prone if it fails its save by 5 or more. Creatures in the fog can't take a 5-foot step. A severe wind disperses the cloud in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Frost Breath.MOD					DESC:You breathe a cone of intense cold at your foes. The spell deals 1d4 points of cold damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4). In addition, all creatures damaged by the frost breath that fail their Reflex save are dazed for 1 round by the sudden shock of cold. Material Component: Three drops of water or fragments of ice (which are held in a cupped palm and blown toward the target).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fugue.MOD						DESC:Creatures that fail their save become affected by the haunting fugue in semirandom ways. On each affected creature's turn (as long as it remains in the affected area), you make a Perform check. The check result determines how the victim's mind and body are affected by the spell. You can select any of the effects for which your Perform check equals or exceeds the required DC. DC Result 15 Victim takes 3d6 points of nonlethal damage 20 Victim takes 3d6 points of sonic damage 25 Victim is knocked prone 30 Victim is nauseated for 1 round 35 Victim is stunned for 1 round 40 Victim attacks nearest target All creatures that succeed on their saves against the spell are disoriented and take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks as long as they remain in the affected area. Focus: A miniature violin bow made of platinum worth 250 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Fuse Arms.MOD					DESC:You cause a creature's multiple arms or tentacles to fuse together into a single pair of stronger limbs. Only limbs that the creature can use as arms or grasping limbs are affected by the spell (so basilisks and monstrous centipedes, neither of which use their limbs to attack or manipulate objects, are unaffected). For every set of limbs fused into the primary set of limbs, the creature gains +4 to Strength when using those fused limbs (affecting activities that would use those limbs, but not activities relying on its bite, legs, and so on). For example, a girallon under the effect of this spell would have one pair of arms and Strength 26 for the purpose of using those arms. A behir, which has three pairs of limbs that it can use as arms, would end up with one pair of arm-limbs with a +8 bonus to Strength for those arms (its six legs would be unaffected). The loss of limbs might reduce the number of attacks available to the subject. If the subject has only two arms or tentacles, they are fused into a single limb, and the creature gains a +4 bonus to Strength on attack rolls made with that limb.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
G'Elsewhere Chant.MOD				DESC:You teleport a target to a random, safe location up to 100 feet distant and visible to you. To randomly determine the subject's destination, roll 1d8 to determine the direction, then roll 1d10?10 to determine the distance from the subject's previous location. Roll direction and distance again if this new destination is outside your line of sight, within a solid object, or more than 5 feet above the ground. If your target is being held (whether an object held by a character or a character being grappled by a creature), the holding or grappling creature also receives a Will saving throw to resist.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Gembomb.MOD						DESC:You turn a gem into a bomb that you (and only you) can lob at enemies. You must hold the gem in your hand when casting the spell. You can toss the bomb with perfect accuracy anywhere within 60 feet. The gembomb explodes in a 5-footradius burst dealing 1d8 points of force damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). Tossing a gembomb is a standard action. Material Component: A gem worth at least 1 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Gemjump.MOD						DESC:This spell teleports you to the location of a specially prepared gem. You initially cast gemjump upon the focus, which you must touch. As a standard action any time after you prepare the stone, you can utter a command word and instantly teleport to the location of the gem, provided you and the stone are on the same plane. The teleport is always on target (as though you are using a greater teleport spell). If the area containing the gem is too small for you, you appear in the nearest sufficiently large space. You can transport, in addition to yourself, one Medium or smaller creature per three caster levels, and can bring along objects as long as their weight does not exceed your maximum load. An unwilling creature can't be teleported by gemjump. Likewise, a creature's Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw. Focus: A gem worth 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
General of Undeath.MOD				DESC:This spell increases the number of Hit Dice of undead that you can control by an amount equal to your caster level. When the duration expires, you lose control of the extra undead as if you had voluntarily relinquished control of them.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghost Touch Armor.MOD				DESC:The subject's armor gains the ghost touch special ability (DMG 219). Material Component: A tiny shield made of resin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghost Touch Weapon.MOD				DESC:Ghost touch weapon makes a weapon magically capable of dealing damage normally to incorporeal creatures, regardless of its enhancement bonus. (An incorporeal creature's 50%% chance to avoid damage does not apply to attacks made with weapons under the effect of this spell.) A ranged weapon affected by this spell does not bestow the ability on its ammunition. The weapon can be picked up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a weapon under the effect of this spell counts as either corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more beneficial to the wielder.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghost Trap.MOD					DESC:You are surrounded by a field of energy that negates incorporeality. The radius of the field is 5 feet per caster level. All incorporeal creatures in this field become corporeal. Creatures cannot turn ethereal while in this area, and ethereal creatures cannot enter or affect the plane this spell was cast on while in this field.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghostform.MOD					DESC:You assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost. You gain the incorporeal subtype for the duration of the spell, providing you with the following abilities and characteristics. You have no physical body while in this state. You can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. You are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells, including touch spells, or magic weapons, you have a 50%% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons). Nondamaging spell effects affect you normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (such as implosion) or they create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (such as a web or wall of stone spell). Your attacks while in ghostform pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against you. Nonmagical attacks you make with a melee weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and any melee attack you make with a magic weapon against a corporeal target has a 50%% miss chance, except for attacks you make with a ghost touch weapon, which are made normally (no miss chance). Spells you cast while in ghostform affect corporeal targets normally, including spells that require you to make an attack roll (such as rays or melee touch spells). Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also incorporeal as long as it remains in your possession. An object that you relinquish loses its incorporeal quality (and you lose the ability to manipulate the object). If you use a thrown weapon or a ranged weapon, the projectile becomes corporeal as soon as it is fired and can affect a corporeal target normally (no miss chance). Magic items you possess work normally with respect to their effects on you or on another target. As an incorporeal creature, you have no natural armor bonus but have a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even if your Charisma score does not normally provide a bonus). You can enter or pass through solid objects while in ghostform, but you must remain adjacent to the object's exterior, and so you cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than your own. You can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to your current location, but enemies have total concealment from you while you are inside an object. In order to see farther from the object you are in and attack normally, you must emerge. While inside an object, you have total cover, but when you attack a creature outside the object you have cover only, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at you as you attack. You cannot pass through a force effect. You can pass through and operate in water as easily as you do in air. You cannot fall or take falling damage. You cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can you be tripped or grappled. In fact, you cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are you subject to such actions. You have no weight while in ghostform and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight. You move silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if you don't wish to be while in ghostform. You have no Strength score while incorporeal, so your Dexterity modifier applies to both your melee attacks and ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to you. You have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when you cannot see.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghostharp.MOD					DESC:You prepare an object that records and replays a song previously played or sung in its vicinity. When cast, the spell searches a radius of 50 feet for the lingering notes of a tune played there within the last day. It records these notes and reverberations. At your verbal command, "Play," the ghostharp replays the music. The tune repeats until you command it to stop, or until its duration comes to an end. The ghostharp does not record conversations. Its imperfect replay can't reproduce bardic music or other magical effects, nor can it cast spells.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghoul Gauntlet.MOD				DESC:The subject takes 3d6 points of damage per round while its body slowly dies and its flesh is transformed into the cold, undying flesh of the undead. When the victim reaches 0 hit points, it becomes a ghoul (MM 118). If the target fails its initial saving throw, remove disease, dispel magic, heal, limited wish, miracle, Mordenkainen's disjunction, remove curse, wish, or greater restoration negates the gradual change. Healing spells can temporarily prolong the process by increasing the victim's hit points, but the transformation continues unabated. The ghoul that you create remains under your control indefinitely. No matter how many ghouls you generate with this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level (this includes undead from all sources under your control). If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (you choose which creatures are released). If you are a cleric, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghoul Gesture.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A subject that is successfully targeted must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for the duration of the spell. A subject of the ray that succeeds on its Fortitude save is instead sickened for the duration of the spell. Neutralize poison removes the sickened condition. Material Component: A small scrap of cloth taken from clothing worn by a ghoul, or a pinch of earth from a ghoul's lair.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghoul Glyph.MOD					DESC:You inscribe a glyph, approximately 1 foot across, that paralyzes any living creature of Large or smaller size that comes within 5 feet of the glyph. You can scribe the glyph to be visible as faintly glowing lines, or invisible. You can inscribe a ghoul glyph on a portable object, but if the object is moved more than 5 feet, the glyph fades. Conditions for triggering a ghoul glyph are stringent. It takes effect on any creature except yourself that moves within 5 feet. It affects invisible creatures normally but is not triggered by those that travel past it ethereally. Only a single ghoul glyph can be inscribed in a 5-foot square. Ghoul glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. Mislead and nondetection can fool a ghoul glyph. Read magic allows identification of a ghoul glyph with a successful DC 13 Spellcraft check, if the glyph is noticed before it is activated. A rogue can use the Search skill to find a ghoul glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 27. When a glyph is activated, the target is paralyzed for 1d6+2 rounds. Additionally, if the target fails a Fortitude save, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes distress in all creatures within a 10-foot radius. Those in the radius, including the target, must make a Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks until the paralysis effect wears off. Material Component: You trace the glyph with earth from a ghoul's lair.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ghoul Light.MOD					DESC:The effect looks like a regular flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, except for its green hue, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. Ghoul light can be covered and hidden, but not smothered or quenched. All undead within 30 feet of a source of ghoul light gain +1 turn resistance. Multiple ghoul light sources do not stack. Darkness spells of 2nd level or higher can counter ghoul light. Material Component: A bit of rendered fat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Giant's Wrath.MOD					DESC:You infuse a handful of stone pebbles with powerful transmutation magic. For the duration of the spell, you can hurl one pebble as an attack action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The instant the pebble leaves contact with your hand, its size and the force of your throw increase dramatically, as the pebble transforms into a boulder. The boulder has a range increment of 120 feet, and you must succeed on a ranged attack to strike a target with the boulder. If you hit the target, the boulder deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage + your Str modifier. You gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level on attack rolls and damage rolls (maximum +10) with these boulders. If you drop a pebble or give it to another creature, the pebbles' magic dissipates harmlessly. Material Component: The pebbles to be transmuted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Girallon's Blessing.MOD				DESC:You give the subject an additional pair of arms. Each of its arms-new and old-ends in a clawed hand with fingers and an opposable thumb. The creature's original arms (if any) are its primary arms, and new limbs are secondary limbs (if the subject had no arms, the arms created by the spell are its primary arms). The creature gains four claw attacks, each using its base attack bonus + its Str modifier for attack rolls. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage + the subject's Str modifier, and if an opponent is struck by two or more claws in 1 round, the subject can rend it for an additional 2d4 points of damage + 1-1/2 times its Str modifier. A creature cannot use normal weapons and the claw attacks in the same round, and the subject does not gain additional claw attacks from a high base attack bonus. Material Component: A few strands of girallon hair.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Glass Strike.MOD					DESC:You transform the target into glass. You can cast either of these two versions: Glass Creature: As flesh to stone (PH 232), but the subject becomes glass. Glass Object: An object of up to 4 cubic feet in volume is affected. Part of a larger object (such as a floor or wall) can be transformed by this spell. Glass has hardness 1, and 1 hit point per inch of thickness. Neither version of the spell affects magic items (magic items carried by a transformed creature remain intact). When the duration ends, the subject returns to its original materials. If the subject was broken or damaged while in glass form, its normal form has similar damage. Focus: A piece of glass from a mirror.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Glowing Orb.MOD					DESC:This spell places a magical light source inside a glass sphere roughly the size of a human fist. You can control the light level generated by a glowing orb by mental command (a standard action), provided that the orb is within 30 feet of you. The light level ranges from no light at all to illumination within a 60-foot radius. There is no limit to the number of glowing orbs you can possess, and you can control their light levels independently or in concert. If a glowing orb is smashed, the magic is lost. If you die, however, an orb retains its magic. Any character with an Intelligence or Wisdom of at least 13 can gain control of an orb simply by touching it. Focus: A glass sphere (50 gp) into which the light is placed. An orb usable for this purpose has hardness 0 and 2 hit points.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Golden Barding.MOD				DESC:You create a suit of barding for your mount to wear. The armor appears on your mount, fitting perfectly. The golden barding you create has no armor check penalty and has no effect on your mount's speed. The exact nature of the barding depends on your caster level. 2nd-3rd: Scale mail barding (+4 armor bonus). 4th-5th: Chainmail barding (+5). 6th-7th: Splint mail barding (+6). 8th-9th: Half-plate barding (+7). 10th+: Full plate barding (+8). You can cast magic vestment or other spells that target a suit of armor on the golden barding.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Golem Strike.MOD					DESC:For 1 round, you can deliver sneak attacks against constructs as if they were not immune to extra damage from sneak attacks. To attack a construct in this manner, you must still meet the other requirements for making a sneak attack. This spell applies only to sneak attack damage. It gives you no ability to affect constructs with critical hits, nor does it confer any special ability to overcome the damage reduction or other defenses of constructs.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Grace.MOD						DESC:You create a silvery glow around your body that provides illumination to a radius of 60 feet. You gain a -20 circumstance penalty on Hide checks made while under the effect of this spell. For the duration of the spell, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to Dexterity, and your base land speed increases by 10 feet. Your touch attacks and any melee weapons you wield become infused with this power as well. They are treated as good-aligned weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Grave Strike.MOD					DESC:For 1 round, you can deliver sneak attacks against undead as if they were not immune to extra damage from sneak attacks. To attack an undead creature in this manner, you must still meet the other requirements for making a sneak attack. This spell applies only to sneak attack damage. It gives you no ability to affect undead with critical hits, nor does it confer any special ability to overcome the damage reduction or other defenses of undead creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Graymantle.MOD					DESC:A skull-shaped cloud of gray energy strikes your target. The gray radiance is transferred to the creature, covering it entirely. For the duration of the spell, a living subject cannot regain hit points or ability score points by any means (undead creatures can still gain hit points), nor can the creature remove negative levels. Regeneration or fast healing abilities the subject has from any source are suppressed for the duration of the spell. Spells that heal damage do not work on that individual. The subject can improve its current hit points by boosting its Constitution score and can receive temporary hit points (from an aid spell, for example). When the spell ends, automatic healing abilities, such as a troll's regeneration, and items that restore hit points, such as a ring of regeneration, begin to function again. Material Component: A skull.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Great Thunderclap.MOD				DESC:You create a loud noise equivalent to a peal of thunder. The spell has three effects. First, all creatures in the area must make Will saves to avoid being stunned for 1 round. Second, the creatures must make Fortitude saves or be deafened for 1 minute. Third, they must make Reflex saves or fall prone. Creatures that cannot hear are not stunned, but might still fall prone. Focus: An iron bell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Guided Shot.MOD					DESC:While this spell is in effect, your ranged attacks do not take a penalty due to distance. In addition, your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and also ignore the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. This spell does not provide any ability to exceed the maximum range of the weapon with which you are attacking, nor does it confer any ability to attack targets protected by total cover.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Guiding Light.MOD					DESC:Bright lights shine at the targets. The lights grant a +2 circumstance bonus on ranged attack rolls against any highlighted target. If a creature gains total cover or total concealment relative to you, or if it leaves the area, the spell ends for that target.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Gutsnake.MOD					DESC:The tentacle created by the gutsnake spell is equivalent to a giant constrictor snake (MM 280) except that it is completely obedient to you and moves as you command. The snake has hit points equal to your own full normal total. Attacks against the snake cause you no discomfort and do not disrupt your spellcasting. If it is "killed," the tentacle disappears without causing harm to you. The tentacle does not interfere with spellcasting in any way. Once each round as a free action, you can have the tentacle attack a creature up to 10 feet away with its bite attack, and if it successfully hits, the tentacle can use the snake's improved grab ability to deal damage through constriction. In each round when the gutsnake is constricting a target, you cannot move more than 5 feet away from that target, unless the gutsnake makes a successful grapple check to carry the opponent with you when you move (see PH 155 for grappling rules). This is the only way in which the tentacle restricts movement. While the snake is present, you can use its Balance and Climb skill modifiers instead of your own, and you gain a climb speed of 20 feet. Focus: A fang from any reptile.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hail of Stone.MOD					DESC:You create a rain of stones that deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d4) to creatures and objects within the area. Material Component: A piece of jade worth at least 5 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell  Hailstones.MOD	DESC:You create frigid hailstones that strike your enemies. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit with a globe. Each hailstone deals 5d6 points of cold damage. For every five caster levels, you gain an additional hailstone (maximum of four stones at 20th level), and all globes must be aimed at enemies that are all within 30 feet of each other. Material Component: A handful of crystal globes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hamatula Barbs.MOD				DESC:Any creature hitting the subject of this spell with a handheld weapon or a natural weapon takes 1d8 points of slashing and piercing damage from the subject's barbs. This damage does not apply to attackers using reach weapons, such as longspears. The subject itself is not harmed by its own barbs. Arcane Material Component: A barb from a hamatula.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hand of Divinity.MOD				DESC:If your deity is non-evil, this spell grants a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws, and the spell is a good spell. If your deity is evil, this spell grants a +2 profane bonus on saving throws, and the spell is an evil spell. This spell works only on a creature with the same deity as you or the same alignment as your deity. If cast on a target that does not meet this criteria, the spell has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hand of the Faithful.MOD			DESC:You create an immobile zone of warding that is permeable to those of your religion but repels all others. Creatures that have the same deity as you, or are wearing the holy symbol of your deity, can enter and move within the warded area unhindered. Other creatures that try to enter or move within the area must make a Fortitude save each round or be stunned for 1 round. If the creature's only action is to try to move completely out of the area, the ward does not hinder it. Once a creature succeeds on its saving throw, it is no longer affected by that casting of hand of the faithful. This spell has the alignment components of your deity, so if your deity is good and lawful, this is a lawful and good spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hardening.MOD					DESC:This spell increases the hardness of materials. Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material's resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (treat steel as iron, base hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have hardness 16 for the purpose of ignoring damage caused by someone making a sunder attack. The sword's hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. A hardening spell does not in any way affect a substance's resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on. This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet of material per level of the caster. If cast upon a metal or mineral, the spell affects only 1 cubic foot per level. Material Component: An ointment made with 50 gp of diamond dust per 10 cubic feet of material.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Harmonic Chorus.MOD				DESC:Harmonic chorus lets you improve the spellcasting ability of another spellcaster. For the duration of the spell, the subject gains a +2 morale bonus to caster level and a +2 morale bonus on save DCs for all spells it casts. Focus: A tuning fork.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Haste (Swift).MOD					DESC:This spell functions like haste (PH 239), except as noted above. This spell counters and dispels any slow effect on you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Haunting Tune.MOD					DESC:Targets that fail their saves become shaken.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hawkeye.MOD						DESC:Your range increment for ranged weapons increases by 50%%, and you gain a +5 competence bonus on Spot checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heal Animal Companion.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like heal (PH 239), except that it affects only your animal companion.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Healing Lorecall.MOD				DESC:A caster with 5 or more ranks in Heal can, when casting a conjuration (healing) spell, choose to remove any one of the following conditions affecting the subject of the spell, in addition to the spell's normal effects: dazed, dazzled, or fatigued. A caster with 10 or more ranks in Heal can choose from the following conditions in addition to those above: exhausted, nauseated, or sickened. Also, when determining the amount of damage healed by your conjuration (healing) spells, you can substitute your total ranks in Heal for your caster level. The normal caster level limit for individual spells still applies; thus, a 3rd-level cleric with 6 ranks in Heal when under the effect of healing lorecall cures 1d8+5 points of damage with a cure light wounds spell. Material Component: A mint leaf.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Healing Sting.MOD					DESC:Focusing the power of negative energy, you deal 1d12 points of damage +1 per caster level (maximum 1d12+10) to a living creature and gain an equal amount of hit points if you make a successful melee touch attack. A healing sting cannot give you more hit points than your full normal total. Excess hit points are lost. Material Component: Five dried wasp bodies.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Healing Touch.MOD					DESC:You transfer some of your life essence to the subject of the spell, healing it. You can heal up to 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), and you decide how many dice to roll when you cast the spell. You take damage equal to half the amount your subject was healed. This spell cannot heal a subject of more damage than your current hit points +10, which is enough to kill you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Healthful Rest.MOD				DESC:Healthful rest doubles the subjects' natural healing rate. Each affected creature regains twice the hit points and ability damage it otherwise would have regained during that day, depending on its activity level (PH 76).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heart of Stone.MOD				DESC:You exchange your own living heart for a finely crafted heart of perfect, unblemished stone, altering the nature of your body. Your living heart can be stored or hidden anywhere you like, where it continues to beat for the duration of the spell. While under the effect of heart of stone, you gain damage reduction 5/- and resistance to cold 5, fire 5, and electricity 5, but are subject to the following disadvantages. Your rate of natural healing slows to only 1 hit point per day (regardless of character level or whether you rest). In addition, your own living heart is susceptible to attack; if it is damaged or destroyed, you are instantly slain. Heart of stone can be dispelled, in which case your living heart instantly returns to its proper place while the stone heart is transported to the place where you left your heart. Your heart and the stone heart likewise switch places if you enter an antimagic field (temporarily negating the spell's effects), but the spell resumes when you leave it. Stone to flesh can also end the spell, though you get a Fortitude saving throw to resist. Focus: A carved stone heart of exceptional quality (jade, obsidian, or goldveined marble) worth 5,000 gp. XP Cost: 500 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heart Ripper.MOD					DESC:Invisible bolts of force instantly slay the target you designate by driving its heart from its body unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. If the target has HD higher than your caster level, it does not die on a failed saving throw, but instead is stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that don't depend on their hearts for survival, creatures with no anatomy, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are unaffected by the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heartfire.MOD					DESC:Outlined subjects shed light as torches. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (although a 3rd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. In addition, if they fail a Fortitude save, affected creatures take 1d4 points of fire damage each round as their passions manifest as physically damaging fire. Creatures that make a successful Fortitude save take only half damage each round for the duration of the spell (minimum 1 point per round). Spellcasters affected by this spell who try to cast spells must make Concentration checks (DC 10 + half the continuous damage last dealt) each round as they take continuous damage from the spell. The fire created by this spell can be extinguished by normal means; doing so ends the outlining effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heat Drain.MOD					DESC:You drain the heat from all living creatures within the affected area except you. This influx of warmth heals and empowers you. All affected living creatures take 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). For every living creature that takes damage from this spell, you gain 2 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute per level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heatstroke.MOD					DESC:If the target creature fails to resist the spell, it immediately becomes fatigued. If it is already fatigued, it instead becomes exhausted. The subject takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from the oppressive heat as well, even if it makes the Fortitude saving throw to avoid fatigue or exhaustion. A creature wearing heavy armor takes a -4 penalty on its save. Creatures with immunity or resistance to fire are not affected by this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heavenly Host.MOD					DESC:When the spell is complete, 2d4 lantern archons (MM 16) appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 hound archons (MM 17) appear. Each creature has maximum hit points per Hit Die. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell. The creatures obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the creatures. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hellish Horde.MOD					DESC:When the spell is complete, 2d4 bearded devils (MM 52) appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 chain devils (MM 53) appear. Ten minutes after that, one bone devil (MM 52) appears. Each creature has maximum hit points per Hit Die. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell. The devils obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the devils. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Herald's Call.MOD					DESC:Any creature with 5 Hit Dice or less is slowed (PH 280) for 1 round. Creatures beyond the radius of the burst might hear the shout, but they are not slowed. An affected creature under the effect of a haste spell has the haste spell suppressed (not dispelled) for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Heroics.MOD						DESC:The heroics spell temporarily grants the subject a feat from the fighter's bonus feat list. For the duration of the heroics spell, the subject can use the feat as if it were one of those the creature had selected. All prerequisites for the feat must be met by the target of this spell. Material Component: A bit of a weapon or armor that has been used in combat by a fighter of at least 15th level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hidden Lodge.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like Leomund's secure shelter (PH 247), except as noted here. The house created by hidden lodge is perfectly camouflaged to blend in with whatever terrain or surroundings are appropriate. It might appear as a house-sized boulder in a rocky or mountainous area, as a sand dune in the desert, as a densely tangled thicket, a grassy knoll, or even a mighty tree. The lodge also obscures all telltale signs of habitation, including any smoke, light, or sound coming from within. At any distance of more than 30 feet, the lodge is indistinguishable from natural terrain. Any creature approaching within 30 feet is entitled to a DC 30 Survival check to spot the hidden lodge as an artificial dwelling and not a natural part of the landscape. Focus: The focus of an alarm spell (silver wire and a tiny bell), if this benefit is to be included in the hidden lodge (see Leomund's secure shelter for more information).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hide from Dragons.MOD				DESC:Dragons cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures, even with blindsense. They act as though the warded creatures are not there. Warded creatures could stand before the hungriest of red dragons and not be molested or even noticed. If a warded character touches or attacks a dragon or the dragon's hoard, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients. Material Component: A dragon scale.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hide the Path.MOD					DESC:Hide the path wards a large, continuous area against divination magic. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level and can be shaped as you desire. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high. Find the path won't function in an area warded by hide the path. In addition, any spellcaster attempting to cast a 1st- through 6th-level divination spell in the warded area must make a caster level check (DC 11 + your caster level) or the spell fails. Higher-level divinations function normally. Hide the path has no effect on divination spells cast outside the warded area. Focus: A 6-inch onyx sphere mounted upon an obsidian stand; the entire focus must be worth no less than 1,000 gp. Any creature in physical contact with the focus can cast divination spells without restriction from the hide the path effect. If the focus is destroyed or brought beyond the boundaries of the hide the path spell, the spell is immediately dismissed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hindsight.MOD					DESC:You can see and hear into the past, getting a look at events that happened previously at your current location. The level of detail you see and hear by means of this spell depends on the span of time you wish to observe; concentrating on a span of days renders a more detailed perspective than a span of centuries, for example. You can view only one span of time per casting, chosen from the following options. Days: You sense the events of the past, stretching back one day per caster level. You gain detailed knowledge of the people, conversations, and events that transpired. Weeks: You gain a summary of the events of the past, stretching back one week per caster level. Exact wording and details are lost, but you know all the participants and the highlights of the conversations and events that took place. Years: You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one year per caster level. You notice only noteworthy events such as deaths, battles, scenes of great emotion, important discoveries, and significant happenings. Centuries: You gain a general idea of the events of the past, stretching back one century plus an additional century for every four caster levels beyond 1st. For instance, a 16th-level caster would gain insight into the events of four centuries in the past, and a 17th-level caster would see back across five centuries. You notice only the most remarkable of events: coronations, deaths of important personages, major battles, and other truly historic happenings. Material Component: An hourglass- shaped diamond worth at least 1,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hiss of Sleep.MOD					DESC:The targets of this spell fall into a comatose slumber. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding the subjects awakens them, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Holy Mount.MOD					DESC:Your special mount gains the celestial template (MM 31) for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Holy Spurs.MOD					DESC:This spell increases your special mount's base land speed by 40 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Holy Star.MOD					DESC:You create a glowing mote of energy that stays near your shoulder, providing light equal to that of a candle. This star has the following three functions, and you can designate which function to activate as a free action on your turn. Spell Turning: A holy star can turn a total of four to seven (1d4+3) spell levels, as the spell turning spell (PH 282). Any turning potential depleted through this use remains so for the duration of the spell; the holy star does not return to full capacity every time you choose this function. If its entire spell turning capacity is expended, this function no longer works, but the others do. Protection: A holy star gives you a +6 circumstance bonus to AC. Fire Bolt: A holy star lashes out with a beam of energy as a ranged touch attack against a creature (you choose the target) up to 90 feet away (no range increment). This attack uses your attack bonus and deals fire damage equal to 1d6 points per two caster levels (maximum 10d6).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Holy Storm.MOD					DESC:A driving rain falls around you. It falls in a fixed area once created. The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks. It also applies a -4 penalty on ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm. Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50%% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns). The rain damages evil creatures, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round (evil outsiders take double damage) at the beginning of your turn. Material Component: A flask of holy water (25 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Holy Transformation.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like lesser holy transformation, but when you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a hound archon (MM 16). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to outsider (archon, good, lawful), and your size changes to Medium. You have the space and reach of a hound archon (5 feet/5 feet). You gain a +4 sacred bonus to Strength and Constitution. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws. You gain damage reduction 5/evil. Evil creatures within 10 feet of you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws. You gain the ability to speak and understand Celestial.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Holy Transformation (Lesser).MOD		DESC:When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a protectar (Miniatures Handbook 66). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to outsider (good), and your size changes to Medium. You have the space and reach of a protectar (5 feet/5 feet). You gain a +2 sacred bonus to Strength and Constitution. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet (good). You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws. You gain the ability to speak and understand Celestial.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Horrible Taste.MOD				DESC:Any creature that bites the spell's subject must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated until the end of its next turn. If a creature of animal Intelligence (2 or lower) fails its saving throw, it will not willingly bite the subject a second time; someone trying to direct the creature to bite the subject again must make a Handle Animal check as if he was trying to "push" the creature. This check must be made every time he tries to make the creature bite. Creatures that are immune to poison or that lack the ability to taste are unaffected by this spell. Material Component: A pinch of rotten meat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Howling Chain.MOD					DESC:You create a chain of force, which lashes out and attacks your enemies. The chain has a reach of 15 feet, but cannot move from the space you designate. The chain attacks by attempting to trip your foes (+12 melee touch attack, +15 on the opposed Strength check). It does not provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping, nor can it be tripped in response on a failed attempt. If it succeeds in tripping an enemy, it immediately follows up with a melee attack on the prone defender (+12 melee attack, 2d6+10 points of damage). Any creature struck by the chain must make a Will saving throw or become shaken. A howling chain can make one attack of opportunity each round for every four caster levels you have, using the same tactic as above. A howling chain has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and its AC is AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't deal damage do not affect it. It makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. Focus: A small length of platinum chain worth at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hungry Gizzard.MOD				DESC:A Large bulbous, fleshy mass seethes into being around a single Medium or smaller target within range. The target can make a Reflex save to avoid becoming engulfed by the hungry gizzard, otherwise it is entombed within the disembodied digestive organ. If the target successfully saves, the gizzard immediately vanishes without further effect. Each round a creature remains trapped inside a hungry gizzard (starting in the round the spell is cast), the target creature is considered grappled and takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage per round and 1d8 points of acid damage. While engulfed, the target creature can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in hand, and it makes a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). An engulfed creature can cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once the creature exits, the gizzard immediately melts into a pool of blood and meaty chunks. There is no immediate physical exit; the only way for those trapped inside to escape is to cut their way free, to dispel the spell, or to have allies outside destroy the gizzard. The gizzard is fairly easy to strike in combat from a vantage point outside of its interior, due to its size (AC 4). A newly formed hungry gizzard has 5 hit points per caster level. The gizzard is treated like an unattended object for the purpose of saving throws. A hungry gizzard reduced to 0 hit points is immediately destroyed. Material Component: A dried gizzard.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hunter's Mercy.MOD				DESC:This transmutation makes a bow strike true. Your first hit with a bow (not including crossbows) in the next round is automatically a critical hit. If you don't hit in the round following the casting of this spell, the effect is wasted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hunters of Hades.MOD				DESC:This spell summons either a single retriever (MM 46) or a pair of pack fiends (Planar Handbook 128) from the Gray Waste of Hades to serve you. The creatures magically understand your spoken commands (regardless of your language). They are treated as trained hunting beasts, so you can command them to track if you so choose. The creatures obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the creatures. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time. Material Component: A pinch of ash. If a retriever is summoned, a 500 gp bloodstone must also be used.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hurl.MOD						DESC:The hurl spell enhances one melee weapon so that it returns to the thrower after being thrown. For the duration of the spell, when thrown, the weapon returns to its wielder at the beginning of the wielder's next action. The weapon returns whether it hit or missed its target. On its return, the thrown weapon hovers for 1 round next to the wielder and can then be seized and thrown again. After 1 round, the weapon falls to the ground. The weapon returns to its wielder only if thrown; it doesn't automatically fly back if dropped or seized by another creature. (An improvised weapon or a weapon not designed for throwing has a range increment of 10 feet.) Throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hymn of Praise.MOD				DESC:You can strike up a rousing, inspirational song that temporarily boosts by 2 the effective caster level of each goodaligned divine spellcaster within range. This increase does not grant access to additional spells, but it does improve all spell effects that are dependent on caster level. Within the spell's area, each good-aligned divine spellcaster gains a +4 sacred bonus on Charisma checks to turn undead, and each evilaligned divine spellcaster takes a -4 sacred penalty on Charisma checks to rebuke undead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hypothermia.MOD					DESC:The subject takes 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and becomes fatigued. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the fatigue.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Axe.MOD						DESC:This spell creates a battleaxe-shaped formation of jagged, fast-swirling ice shards in your hand. You are automatically considered proficient with the ice axe. Attacks with the ice axe are melee touch attacks. The axe deals 2d12 points of cold damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) with a successful hit. You cannot be disarmed of the ice axe nor can it be sundered. Since the axe is virtually weightless, your Strength modifier does not apply on damage rolls. If your base attack bonus is high enough to allow for multiple attacks in a round, you can make them with the ice axe. If you choose to hold something other than the ice axe in your hand or use the hand in some other way, the ice axe vanishes until the hand is empty again. Material Component: A shard of ice, glass, or crystal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Claw.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a massive reptilian claw made of ice. The ice claw can make one grapple attack per round. Its attack bonus and grapple modifier are equal to your caster level + your Int modifier or Cha modifier (for wizards and sorcerers, respectively) + 7 for the claw's Strength (24). In any round when the claw is grappling a target, it deals 1d8 points of cold damage. The claw can attack in the round it appears. Directing it to change targets is a standard action. It always attacks from your direction and does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. The claw has as many hit points as you do when undamaged and has AC 20 (+10 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that do not deal damage do not affect it. The claw cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field. It suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The claw has your saving throw bonuses. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. It has immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire. Focus: A white leather glove and a piece of clear rock crystal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Dagger.MOD					DESC:The ice dagger created by this spell launches itself at a target. Treat the attack as a thrown splash weapon (PH 158) that requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ice dagger deals 1d4 points of cold damage to the target per caster level (maximum 5d4), and splash damage of 1 point of cold damage to adjacent creatures. Material Component: A few drops of water made from melted ice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Flowers.MOD					DESC:This spell causes moisture in the ground at a point you designate to freeze into a mound of solid ice covered by a layer of soil, which bursts violently through the surface. This flings dangerous ice shards and small stones throughout the area, turning the surface of the ground in the spell's area into dense rubble (DMG 90). The shards and stones deal 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is cold damage. The origin point of the spell must be on the ground. This spell has no effect in desert terrain or on solid stone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Gauntlet.MOD					DESC:You can attack with your fist in all respects as if you were wearing a +1 spiked gauntlet. The +1 spiked gauntlet deals normal damage for your size and 1d4 points of cold damage. Damage reduction applies to the ice gauntlet's normal damage, but it does not affect the cold damage. If you fail a saving throw against a fire effect, the ice gauntlet melts and the spell ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ice Knife.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to hit (with a +2 bonus on the attack roll for every two caster levels). If it hits, an ice knife deals 2d8 points of cold damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage (a successful Fortitude save negates the Dexterity damage). Creatures that have immunity to cold also take no Dexterity damage automatically. A knife that misses creates a shower of ice crystals in a 10- foot-radius burst (see Missing with a Thrown Weapon, PH 158, to determine where the shard hits). The icy burst deals 1d8 points of cold damage to all creatures within the area (Reflex half). Material Component: A drop of water or piece of ice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Icelance.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a normal ranged attack to strike a target with an icelance. You gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll. If you hit, the icelance deals 6d6 points of damage to the target. Half of this damage is piercing damage; the rest is cold damage. In addition, the target must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of the result of the attack, the icelance shatters upon its first use. Focus: A 50-gp clear quartz gemstone. Alternatively, if you are in a cold region, you can substitute 10 pounds of ice or snow for the quartz.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Illusory Feast.MOD				DESC:Tantalizing food and drink appears, causing creatures in the area to stop what they are doing and eat. A creature in the area that fails its save stops its current activities, drops held or carried items, and begins consuming the illusory food and drink. The food looks, feels, smells, tastes, and even sounds real to the affected creature, and it appears to be whatever kind of food the creature prefers. The creature is considered dazed. An attack on an affected creature frees it from the spell immediately. Sightless creatures are affected by this spell due to its effect on all the senses. Creatures that do not eat are unaffected by this spell. Material Component: A piece of trail rations.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Illusory Pit.MOD					DESC:You create the illusion of a pit, and each creature entering or within the area is forced to make a Will save or believe the floor on which it stands has become a bottomless chasm. Those that fail their saves fall prone and are unable to take any action except clawing desperately at the floor in the hopes of stopping their apparent fall. An attack on an affected creature frees it from the effect of the illusion but leaves it stunned for 1 round. Likewise, when the spell ends, creatures that believed they were falling are stunned for 1 round. Flying creatures passing over an illusory pit are unaffected by the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Imbue Familiar withSpell Ability.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to transfer a number of your spells and the ability to cast them into your familiar. Spontaneous spellcasters, such as sorcerers, can imbue a familiar with any spells they know how to cast, subject to the restrictions below. Arcanists who prepare spells, such as wizards, can imbue a familiar with any spell they have currently prepared. In either case, you can imbue one spell per three caster levels, with a maximum spell level of one-third your caster level, rounded down (maximum 5th level). Multiple castings of imbue familiar with spell ability have no effect on these limits. The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and so on) function according to your level. Once you cast imbue familiar with spell ability on your familiar, both the spell slot from which you cast the spell and the spell slots of the transferred spells remain unavailable for the preparation or casting of new spells until the familiar uses the transferred spells or imbue familiar with spell ability expires. The spell can be dispelled; if this happens, the spells transferred are lost as if the familiar had cast them. In an antimagic field, the familiar loses the ability to cast the imbued spells, but regains it again if it leaves the field (as long as the spell's duration hasn't expired). If any transferred spell requires a focus or material component, you must have it on your person when the spells are cast (components are consumed as normal without requiring you to bring them to hand). Any XP costs from a transferred spell are deducted from your total when the familiar casts the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Imperious Glare.MOD				DESC:The targets must make successful Will saves or cower. The saving throw DC to resist this effect is either the normal save DC for the spell or the save DC for your natural frightful presence ability, whichever is higher. You cannot cast this spell if you do not have a frightful presence ability, either natural or magically bestowed (such as from the aura of terror spell, for example).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Implacable Pursuer.MOD				DESC:The implacable pursuer spell gives you the direction and distance to the target creature whenever it finishes a turn more than 10 feet away from where it started. If you are a ranger, you apply your favored enemy bonus to the DC of the Will save. Once you successfully target a creature with implacable pursuer, you know its location as long as the subject is moving, no matter where it goes on the same plane. Even if it leaves the plane, implacable pursuer tells you what plane the subject creature went to. The spell then provides no further information until you and the subject creature are on the same plane, in which case the spell resumes functioning normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Improvisation.MOD					DESC:You gain access to a floating "pool" of luck, which manifests as bonus points you can use as desired to improve your odds of success at various tasks. This bonus pool consists of 2 points per caster level, which you can spend as you like to improve attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks, although no single check can receive a bonus greater than one-half your caster level. You must declare any bonus point usage before the appropriate roll is made. Used points disappear from the pool, and any points remaining when the spell ends are wasted. These points count as luck bonuses for the purpose of stacking. For example, a 14th-level bard pauses while chasing a pickpocket to cast improvisation. At any time during the next 14 rounds, he could use the points to provide himself a +7 luck bonus on a Spot check, a +7 luck bonus on a Climb check, and a +7 luck bonus on two of his attacks. Material Component: A pair of dice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Incite.MOD						DESC:Affected creatures are not allowed to delay or to ready an action. If a subject is currently delaying, it acts as soon as the spell is cast. If the subject currently has an action readied, it loses that action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Incorporeal Enhancement.MOD			DESC:The undead affected by this spell gain a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class, +1d8 bonus hit points, a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and a +2 bonus to turn resistance. Each of these enhancements improves by the base amount for every five caster levels beyond 5th, so that a 20th-level caster grants undead +4 to AC, +4d8 bonus hit points, +4 on attack rolls, and +8 to turn resistance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Incorporeal Nova.MOD				DESC:The spell destroys 1d4 HD worth of creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4) in the area. Usually, creatures such as shadows, wraiths, spectres, ghosts, and similar creatures are destroyed, though vampires and living creatures in gaseous form are also affected, as are other incorporeal creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those that are closest to the point of origin of the burst are affected first. No creature with 9 or more HD is affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Indomitability.MOD				DESC:The indomitability spell protects its recipient from the first incapacitating attack the creature suffers during the spell's duration. An incapacitating attack is one that would reduce the recipient to fewer than 1 hit point. The attack must be one that deals damage; the indomitability spell offers no protection from nondamaging effects or attacks that kill or destroy without dealing any damage, such as death effects. Regardless of how much damage the attack deals, the recipient of the indomitability spell takes only enough damage to be reduced to 1 hp. The remaining damage from the attack is ignored. Once the spell protects the subject in this manner, the spell is discharged.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Infernal Threnody.MOD				DESC:You can strike up a pulsing, powerful rhythm that temporarily boosts by 2 the effective caster level of each evil-aligned divine spellcaster within range. This increase does not grant access to additional spells, but it does improve all spell effects that are dependent on caster level. Within the spell's area, each evil-aligned divine spellcaster gains a +4 profane bonus on Charisma checks to rebuke undead, and each good-aligned divine spellcaster takes a -4 profane penalty on Charisma checks to turn undead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Infernal Transformation.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like lesser infernal transformation, except when you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a bone devil (MM 52). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to outsider (baatezu, evil, lawful), and your size changes to Large. You have the space and reach of a bone devil (10 feet/10 feet). You gain a +4 profane bonus to Strength and Constitution and darkvision out to 60 feet. You gain damage reduction 5/good. You also grow a tail like that of a scorpion. Whenever you take a full attack action, you can use the tail to make an additional attack each round at your highest attack bonus. A successful attack deals 3d4 points of damage + your Str modifier. This attack overcomes damage reduction as if it were an evil weapon. Creatures hit by the tail attack must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Con modifier) or be subjected to poison (injury, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str). Your equipment grows to match your new size and form, allowing the tail attack to function even if you are wearing heavy armor or other restrictive clothing. You gain the ability to speak and understand Infernal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Infernal Transformation (Lesser).MOD	DESC:When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a bearded devil (MM 52). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to outsider (baatezu, evil, lawful), and your size changes to Medium. You have the space and reach of a bearded devil (5 feet/5 feet). You gain a +2 profane bonus to Strength and Constitution and darkvision out to 60 feet. You grow a snaky beard. Whenever you take a full attack action, you can use the beard to make an additional attack each round at your highest attack bonus plus all appropriate modifiers. A successful attack deals 1d8 points of damage + your Str modifier. This attack overcomes damage reduction as if it were an evil weapon. Creatures hit by the beard attack must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Con modifier) or be affected by the devil chills disease (DMG 292). You gain the ability to speak and understand Infernal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Infernal Wound.MOD				DESC:A creature injured by a weapon with infernal wound cast upon it loses 2 additional hit points each round for the duration of the spell (regardless of how many times it is struck during that time). The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a Heal check (DC 10 + spell level + your relevant ability modifier), a cure spell, or a heal spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Inferno.MOD						DESC:The target of the inferno takes 6d6 points of fire damage unless it makes a Fortitude save. In each round thereafter, the fire deals 1d6 fewer points of damage (minimum 1d6) until the spell ends or the subject manages to extinguish the flames. Thus, the fire deals 5d6 points of damage in the second round, 4d6 points in the third round, and so forth. Flammable, nonmagical items carried by the target automatically fail their saves to resist this damage. After the first round, the subject can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save as a full-round action to extinguish the flames before taking additional damage. Rolling on the ground (the subject becomes prone) allows the target a +2 bonus on this save. Leaping into a large body of water or magically extinguishing the flames automatically ends the effect. Material Component: A gob of beeswax.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Infestation of Maggots.MOD			DESC:With a successful melee touch attack, you infest a creature with maggotlike creatures. If the touched creature fails a Fortitude saving throw, the magical maggots deal 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the beginning of your turn. The subject makes a new Fortitude save each round to negate the damage in that round and end the effect. The infestation can be removed with a remove disease or heal spell. Material Component: A handful of dead, dried flies.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Inhibit.MOD						DESC:You inhibit your foe from acting. The subject is forced to delay until the following round, acting immediately before you on your initiative count.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Inky Cloud.MOD					DESC:You create an inky cloud that billows out from your location. The cloud obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment. Creatures farther away have total concealment. A moderate current disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong current disperses the cloud in 1 round. This spell functions only underwater. Material Component: A small vial containing the ink of a squid or octopus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Insidious Rhythm.MOD				DESC:The subject takes a -4 penalty on Intelligence-based skill checks and Concentration checks due to an endlessly recycling melody stuck in its mind. Whenever the subject attempts to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check (DC equal to insidious rhythm's save DC + spell's level) or fail at the attempt.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Insightful Feint.MOD				DESC:You gain a +10 insight bonus on the next single Bluff check that you make to feint in combat (if it is made before the start of your next turn). You can make the feint as a move action, or once as a free action if you have the Improved Feint feat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Inspirational Boost.MOD				DESC:While this spell is in effect, the morale bonus granted by your inspire courage bardic music increases by 1. The effect lasts until your inspire courage effect ends. If you don't begin to use your inspire courage ability before the beginning of your next turn, the spell's effect ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Instant Locksmith.MOD				DESC:You can make one Disable Device check or one Open Lock check in this round as a free action. You gain a +2 insight bonus on the check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Instant Refuge.MOD				DESC:This powerful variant of the contingency spell automatically transfers you and everything you carry or touch (except for other creatures or objects that weigh more than 50 pounds) to a locale you name. When casting instant refuge, you must specify the locale and detail up to six specific conditions that trigger the spell. When any of these situations occurs, you are whisked away to the location. The location can be any place you have visited, even on another plane. Material Component: A concoction made from demon skin and rare herbs worth 250 gp. XP Cost: 100 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Instant Search.MOD				DESC:You can make one Search check in this round as a free action. You gain a +2 insight bonus on the check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Interplanar Message.MOD				DESC:This spell allows you to send a limited message of twenty-five words or less to the targeted creature, who can be on another plane when the message is received. Casting the spell takes a standard action, during which you touch the creature you intend to communicate with. That creature should be able to understand a language you know (otherwise, when the magic is activated, the creature knows that you sent the message, but has no idea what the message is). At any time afterward, you can send your interplanar message to that creature. The message pops into the target's mind, awake or asleep, and the target is aware that the message has been delivered. If the message arrives when the target is asleep, it might appear as a vivid dream that the target remembers upon awakening. This spell does not obligate nor force the creature you communicate with to act. The target cannot reply to tell you its plans or intentions. The message travels through the Astral Plane to reach its target, so the spell cannot reach planes separate from (not coterminous to or coexistent with) the Astral Plane. You can have only one interplanar message active at any given time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Interplanar Telepathic Bond.MOD		DESC:This spell functions like Rary's telepathic bond (PH 268), except that the communication functions both on the same plane and across planes. Material Component: Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility (Superior).MOD			DESC:This powerful glamer functions like invisibility (PH 245), except that it masks image, scent, and sound alike, concealing the subject from all senses except touch. As with greater invisibility, this spell doesn't end if the subject attacks. While invisible, the subject exudes no scent and is undetectable by scent, blindsense, tremorsense, and blindsight. Superior invisibility renders the recipient immune to detection by see invisibility, faerie fire, glitterdust, invisibility purge, and dust of appearance, although creatures under the effect of the spell can be detected by true seeing. Certain mundane conditions (such as leaving footprints) can also render a subject detectable.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Invisibility (Swift).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like invisibility (PH 245), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Iron Bones.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like stone bones (page 208), except that the subject creature's skeleton changes to iron. The creature gains a +6 natural armor bonus to AC. Arcane Focus: A miniature skull made out of iron or steel.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Iron Silence.MOD					DESC:While this spell is in effect, the armor check penalty from the affected suit or suits of armor does not apply on Hide and Move Silently checks. Only wearers proficient in the armor's use get this benefit when wearing the affected armor. The armor check penalty still applies to other skill checks as normal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ironguard.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like lesser ironguard, except that the subject you touch is immune to magic metal as well. Material Component: A tiny shield of wood, glass, or crystal. Focus: A small nugget of adamantine worth 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ironguard (Lesser).MOD				DESC:The subject of lesser ironguard becomes immune to nonmagical metal. Metal items (including metal weapons) simply pass through you, and you can walk through metal barriers such as iron bars. Magic metal affects you normally, as do spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects. Attacks delivered by metal items (such as poison on a dagger) affect you normally. If the spell expires while metal is inside you, the metal object is shunted out of your body (or you away from the metal, if it is an immovable object such as a set of iron bars). You and the object each take 1d6 points of damage as a result (ignoring the object's hardness for determining damage to it). Because you pass through metal, you can ignore armor bonuses from nonmagic metal armor on opponents you attack with unarmed attacks. Material Component: A tiny shield of wood, glass, or crystal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ironguts.MOD					DESC:You enable a creature to better fight off the effect of poison. The subject is filled with antitoxin and gains a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves against all kinds of poisons, whether injury, contact, ingestion, or inhalation. After the spell ends, the subject is nauseated for 1 round. Material Component: A vial containing the diluted poison of four different creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ironthunder Horn.MOD				DESC:You create a deep resonant vibration that can shake creatures off their feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or fall prone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Jagged Tooth.MOD					DESC:This spell doubles the critical threat range of one natural weapon that deals either slashing or piercing damage. Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range don't stack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Jaws of the Wolf.MOD				DESC:You turn small wooden carvings into a number of worgs (MM 256) equal to one for every two caster levels. These worgs appear between you and your opponents. They act on their own but obey your mental commands. If the worgs move beyond the range of the spell, or at the end of the spell, the worgs become carvings again. Killing a worg destroys its focus item. Focus: One carving of a worg for each that you create (25 gp each).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Joyful Noise.MOD					DESC:You create sonic vibrations that negate any magical silence effect in the area. This zone of negation moves with you and lasts as long as you continue to concentrate. The silence effect is not dispelled but simply held in abeyance; it remains in effect outside the area of the joyful noise effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Junglerazer.MOD					DESC:Fey, vermin, plants and plant creatures, and animals caught in the area take 1d10 points of negative energy damage per caster level (maximum 10d10). Material Component: A pinch of ash from a burnt plant.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Jungle's Rapture.MOD				DESC:The creature targeted by this spell immediately takes 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. This drain manifests as a hardening of the limbs and skin as the victim's flesh slowly turns to wood. Each day that passes, the victim takes an additional 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. Even if drained points are restored (through restoration, for example), the target creature still takes Dexterity drain each day until the spell is lifted. Once a victim of jungle's rapture is drained to 0 Dexterity, it immediately transforms into a normal plant of the same size as its original body. Aside from radiating an aura of transmutation magic, the plant is a normal plant with no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores. Jungle's rapture is a curse, and as such it cannot be dispelled. It can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Remove curse works only if the caster level of that spell is equal to or higher than your caster level at the time you cast jungle's rapture.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Kelpstrand.MOD					DESC:Make a ranged touch attack at each target. If you hit a creature, you immediately make an opposed grapple check against the creature as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. You add your caster level and your Wisdom bonus to the result of your grapple check rather than your Strength bonus and size bonus. If you succeed, the target becomes entangled in the thick strands of kelp and is grappled. Each round, the target can attempt to escape the kelpstrand by making a successful grapple or Escape Artist check against the kelpstrand's grapple check. You are not considered grappling yourself while using this spell. Once you shoot your strands of kelp, you need not take any action to maintain the effect. A creature targeted with multiple kelpstrands has to make separate grapple or Escape Artist checks against each kelpstrand currently grappling it to escape. If you cast this spell while you are within 300 feet of the ocean shore, you gain a +4 bonus on any grapple checks made to determine the outcome of a kelpstrand grapple. Material Component: A piece of dried seaweed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Kiss of the Vampire.MOD				DESC:You gain damage reduction 10/magic, and you can use any one of the following abilities each round as a standard action. . enervation, as a melee touch attack . vampiric touch, as a melee touch attack . charm person . gaseous form (self only) While you are using this spell, inflict spells heal you and cure spells hurt you. You are treated as if you were undead for the purpose of all spells and effects. A successful turn (or rebuke) attempt against an undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + turning character's Cha modifier) or be panicked (or cowering) for 10 rounds. A turn attempt that would destroy (or command) undead of your Hit Dice requires you to make a Will save (DC 15 + turning character's Cha modifier) or be stunned (or charmed as by charm monster) for 10 rounds. Any charm effect you create with this spell ends when the spell ends, but all other effects remain until their normal duration expires. Material Component: A black onyx worth at least 50 gp that has been carved with the image of a fangmouthed face.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Knight's Move.MOD					DESC:You can teleport with a limited distance and a circumspect form of movement. You can instantly move up to 5 feet per two caster levels with this spell, but you must end this movement in a square that leaves you flanking an enemy.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know Greatest Enemy.MOD				DESC:This spell evaluates the creatures in the area and determines the relative power level of each. Creatures are evaluated as follows. CR Strength 4 or lower Weak 5-10 Moderate 11-15 Strong 16 or higher Overwhelming Among creatures within the same category, you know which is the most powerful, but not why. For example, among a group of ogres (CR 2), you would know one of them (an ogre with two levels of barbarian, CR 4) was the most powerful, but not know if it was because the ogre had class levels, a template (such as half-fiendish), or for another reason. Any spell of 3rd level or higher that prevents scrying attempts on a creature (such as nondetection) or an area (such as false vision) thwarts this spell's ability to evaluate that creature or creatures within that area.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know Opponent.MOD					DESC:You gauge the strengths and weaknesses of an opponent to gain combat advantages. Upon casting this spell, you learn a number of strengths or weaknesses of the target equal to one, plus one strength or weakness per two caster levels (maximum four). You can choose to learn strengths, weaknesses, or some combination thereof that you specify. If a creature has more strengths or weaknesses than you can learn with a single casting, you learn the most powerful ones first. Thus, if a monster can use finger of death at will and has resistance to sonic 5, you would learn about finger of death first. Strengths can include attack forms and special abilities (including spelllike abilities or supernatural abilities). Weaknesses include vulnerability to an energy type. For example, suppose a 7th-level cleric casts know opponent on a blackarmored warrior, choosing to learn one strength and two weaknesses. The warrior fails his save, and the DM informs the cleric's player that the opponent has the ability to drain energy (a strength), is adversely affected by sunlight, and can be repelled by a holy symbol (both weaknesses). The cleric then concludes that he faces a vampire and breaks out the wooden stakes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Know Vulnerabilities.MOD			DESC:You learn any special qualities, vulnerabilities, and resistances the target creature has. Vulnerabilities include anything that causes the creature more than the normal amount of damage (such as a creature with the cold subtype having vulnerability to fire or a crystalline creature's susceptibility to the shatter spell). Resistances include any effects that reduce or negate damage the creature takes and immunities to particular attacks. The spell identifies resistances and vulnerabilities granted by spell effects. For example, if cast upon a balor, you learn that it has damage reduction 15/cold iron and good; spell resistance 28; immunity to poison, fire, and electricity; resistance to acid 10 and cold 10; and that it does not have any particular vulnerabilities.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Land Womb.MOD					DESC:You cannot enter a land womb through stone or rock, only through tillable soil. The land womb holds you secure 10 feet below the surface. Anyone in a land womb cannot be perceived by divination spells of 4th level or less. You can bring one additional creature per caster level with you into the land womb. All creatures to be brought into the land womb must be touching each other (for instance, holding hands in a ring). Land womb creates an underground space large enough to hold all target creatures. While space is tight, spellcasting by targets is still possible while in the confines of the spell's effect. You can no longer hear or see anything on the surface by nonmagical means. You can end the spell at will, but those who are with you cannot. At the end of the spell's duration, all within the land womb return to the spot where they stood before the spell took effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Languor.MOD						DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. This ray causes creatures it hits to become weak and slow for the spell's duration. A struck creature takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+10). In addition, a subject that fails a Will save is slowed. The spell's slow effect counters and is countered by haste.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Last Breath.MOD					DESC:Last breath restores life to a recently deceased creature, creating a new body for the returning spirit to inhabit. However, the spell must be cast within 1 round of the victim's death. This spell functions like reincarnate (PH 270), except that the reincarnated creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature has -1 hit points (but is stable). Material Component: Rare oils and unguents worth a total of at least 500 gp, spread over the remains.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Launch Bolt.MOD					DESC:You cast this spell on a crossbow bolt, causing it to fly at a target of your choice as if you had fired it from a light crossbow, using a ranged attack roll. The bolt has a range increment of 80 feet. Any properties of the crossbow bolt (such as magical abilities, masterwork quality, and so on) or feats you possess (such as Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus [light crossbow], and so on) apply. Drawing a bolt for this spell is a free action. Material Component: The crossbow bolt to be fired (1 sp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Launch Item.MOD					DESC:You cause a Fine item in your possession to fly at great speed to a target or location you specify, out to medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). This spell is normally used to launch dangerous items (flasks of acid, thunderstones, and so on) farther than you could normally throw them. You can use this spell to make an attack with a splash weapon. If you choose to do so, you must make an attack roll as normal, but you suffer no penalties for range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lawful Sword.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like holy sword (PH 242), except as follows. The weapon functions as a +5 axiomatic weapon (+5 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, lawful-aligned, deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against chaotic opponents). It also emits a magic circle against chaos effect (as the spell).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lay of the Land.MOD				DESC:You instantly gain an overview of the area around you. Lay of the land gives basic information relevant to major landmarks, such as rivers, lakes, and settlements (of at least hamlet size). It indicates the direction and distance to each from the current location. You have a good understanding of the terrain up to 50 miles from your current location. Unlike find the path, this spell does not give information on traps, passwords, or impediments to a journey. Arcane Focus: A small piece of lodestone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Life Bolt.MOD					DESC:You draw forth some of your own life force to create a beam of positive energy that harms undead. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if the ray hits an undead creature, it deals 1d12 points of damage. Creating each beam deals you 1 point of nonlethal damage. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you can create an additional ray, up to a maximum of five rays at 9th level. If you shoot multiple rays, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage. All rays must be aimed at enemies that are all within 30 feet of each other.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Life Ward.MOD					DESC:A creature warded by this spell gains protection from the effects of positive energy, including magical healing. The spell can be cast upon undead to offer additional protection against the turning abilities of clerics. The subject is immune to all positive energy effects, including conjuration (healing) spells, channeled positive energy such as from the turn undead ability, or other effects that derive their power from positive energy. This spell offers protection from the blinding effect of the Positive Energy Plane, and warded creatures gain no temporary hit points while there.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Life's Grace.MOD					DESC:The living creature touched becomes immune to all death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and any negative energy effects. In addition, the subject is immune to undead special attacks that deal ability damage, ability drain, and magical disease (such as mummy rot), even if these attacks do not have a magical source. (For example, the spell prevents poison damage from the poisonous bite of an undead creature.) This spell does not prevent such attacks from undead originating from spells, magic items, or class abilities; only the special attacks from the undead's base nature are affected. In addition, the subject's armor or clothing is considered ghost touch armor, and its armor bonus counts against incorporeal attacks. (A suit of clothing is considered armor that gives +0 AC for this purpose, though it can be enhanced with spells such as magic vestment.) This spell doesn't remove negative levels that the subject has already gained, nor does it affect the saving throw necessary 24 hours after gaining a negative level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Light of Lunia.MOD				DESC:The silvery radiance created by this spell emanates from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light extends for an additional 30 feet. Beginning one turn after you cast this spell, you can choose to expend some or all of the light of Lunia as a ray of light. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. You can make a single ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, or 2d6 points of damage against undead or evil outsiders, with a range of 30 feet. Spell resistance applies to this attack. This dims your silvery radiance to half (15-foot light, with dim light for an additional 15 feet). You can choose to fire one additional ray with the same characteristics either on the same round or on a subsequent round. Firing the second ray quenches your radiance and ends the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Light of Mercuria.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like light of Lunia, except that the radiance created is golden. Your light rays deal 2d6 points of damage, or 4d6 points of damage against undead and evil outsiders.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Light of Venya.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like light of Lunia, except that a softy pearly radiance is created. Your light rays deal 3d6 points of damage, or 6d6 points of damage against undead and evil outsiders. Alternatively, you can choose for the ray to heal 1d6 points of damage + your divine spellcaster level (maximum 1d6+10) to a living, non-evil creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lightfoot.MOD					DESC:You provoke no attacks of opportunity when moving.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lightning Ring.MOD				DESC:The ring of electricity moves with you and does not interfere with your spellcasting or attacks, or with others attacking you. As long as the lightning ring is in effect, you gain resistance to electricity 20. At the beginning of your turn each round, adjacent creatures take 10d6 points of electricity damage, or half that with a successful Reflex save. In addition, each round as a free action at the beginning of your turn, you can direct two lightning bolts that deal 5d6 points of electricity damage each, exactly as the lightning bolt spell (caster level 5th), in any directions you choose. Each bolt can be aimed separately. A creature struck by one of these bolts can make a Reflex save for half damage. The DC for this save is calculated for an 8th-level spell, even though the bolts mimic a 3rd-level spell. Material Components: A small glass ring and a bit of fur from any animal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lionheart.MOD					DESC:The subject gains immunity to fear effects. Material Component: A hair from a lion's mane.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lion's Charge.MOD					DESC:This spell grants you the pounce special ability (MM 313), allowing you to make a full attack at the end of a charge.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lion's Roar.MOD					DESC:All enemies within the spell's area take 1d8 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) and are stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect. In addition, all allies within the spell's area gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+20 temporary hit points at caster level 20th).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Listening Coin.MOD				DESC:You turn two ordinary coins into magic listening devices-one a sensor and the other a receiver. After casting the spell, you simply give the sensor coin away, either surreptitiously or overtly. By holding the receiver coin up to your ear, you can hear whatever transpires near the sensor as if you were there (much like a clairaudience effect). If the sensor coin is in a pocket, pouch, or sack, the DC of the Listen check increases by 5. The coins continue to function no matter how far apart they are, although they fall silent if they're on different planes. Focus: The pair of coins.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Listening Lorecall.MOD				DESC:You gain a +4 insight bonus on Listen checks. In addition, if you have 5 or more ranks in Listen, you gain blindsense out to 30 feet. If you have 12 or more ranks in Listen, you gain blindsight out to 15 feet. A silence spell or effect negates the blindsense or blindsight granted by a listening lorecall spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lively Step.MOD					DESC:Once you cast this spell, the speed of you and all allies within 30 feet of you increases by 10 feet. You and other affected creatures can only benefit from this spell by refraining from taking any actions other than move actions. When one of the affected creatures takes any other kind of action, this spell ends. Focus: A small drum.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Living Prints.MOD					DESC:You perceive tracks as if they had just been made. You must notice the prints normally with a successful Search or Survival check, but this eliminates any penalties to your tracking due to the passage of time or any rainfall since the making of the trail. This spell has no effect on tracks more than thirty days old.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Living Undeath.MOD				DESC:This spell imparts a physical transformation upon the subject, not unlike the process that produces a zombie. While the subject does not actually become undead, its vital processes are temporarily bypassed with no seeming ill effect. The subject is not subject to sneak attacks and critical hits for the duration of the spell, as if it were undead. While the spell is in effect, the subject takes a -4 penalty to its Charisma score (to a minimum of 1).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Love's Lament.MOD					DESC:Creatures within the area of this spell that fail their saves take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and are nauseated for 1d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Low-Light Vision.MOD				DESC:The subject creature gains low-light vision. Arcane Material Component: A small candle.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Loyal Vassal.MOD					DESC:You protect the subjects against mindaffecting spells and abilities, giving them a +3 sacred bonus on saving throws against such effects. The spell also helps prevent them from being magically compelled to harm you or anyone else affected by this spell. Any attempt to make a loyal vassal do so (whether the originating effect occurred before or after this spell was cast) counts as a suicidal order, triggering appropriate responses and possibly ending the controlling spell. If the subjects willingly attempt to harm you, the spell is broken for them immediately.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Lucent Lance.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A creature struck is blinded for 1 round, and dazzled for 1 round per caster level. A creature sensitive to bright light (such as a drow, duergar, or kuo-toa) takes penalties as if it had been exposed to full daylight for 1 round if struck by the beam, even if it resists the spell's other effects. In addition to this dazzling effect, lucent lance deals damage based on the level of light available within your square. In bright light, it deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). In shadowy illumination, it deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4). If no light is present in your square, the spell cannot be cast at all. Focus: A clear glass or crystal rod.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Luminous Gaze.MOD					DESC:This spell causes your eyes to glow with an unearthly radiance. The glow from your eyes provides light as per the light spell. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of you is dazzled as long as they remain with range. Sightless creatures are unaffected.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Maddening Scream.MOD				DESC:This spell makes it impossible for the victim to do anything other than race about caterwauling. The creature must move its speed each turn, unless somehow prevented, and can take no other action. The spell gives the subject a -4 penalty to Armor Class, its Reflex saving throws fail except on a roll of 20, and the subject cannot use a shield.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Maddening Whispers.MOD				DESC:You can choose to inflict one of the following conditions upon any creatures that fail their saving throws. Hysteria: The subjects fall into fits of uncontrollable laughing or crying (equal chance for either). This hysteria affects subjects as though they were nauseated; they are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action a subject can take is a single move action per turn. Panic: The subjects become panicked. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers. Violent Hallucinations: The subjects perceive any nearby creatures as dangerous enemies, attacking the nearest ones and fighting until the subjects are slain or until no more creatures are in sight. Stupor: The subjects curl up on the floor and remain oblivious to events around them. Characters in a stupor are effectively stunned and prone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Maelstrom.MOD					DESC:Maelstrom causes a deadly vortex to form in water. A body of water in which you form the maelstrom must be at least 120 feet wide and 60 feet deep, or the spell is wasted. Waterborne creatures or objects within 50 feet of the vortex (below and on all sides) must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked in. Trained swimmers can attempt Swim checks instead if their skill modifier is higher than their Reflex save bonus. Waterborne vessels avoid being sucked in if their operators make Profession (sailor) checks against the same DC as the spell's saving throw. These creatures and objects take 3d8 points of damage upon being sucked in. Once inside, creatures and objects take 3d8 points of bludgeoning damage each round at the beginning of your turn. They remain trapped for 2d4 rounds, after which time they are ejected to any square adjacent to the bottom of the vortex (your choice). Ejected subjects might be sucked back into the vortex, but they receive a new Reflex save. Subjects of Large or smaller size are ejected from the bottom of the vortex. Larger subjects are ejected from the top.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage Armor (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like mage armor (PH 249), except that it requires no material component and its tangible field of force provides a +6 armor bonus to Armor Class.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage Armor (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like mage armor (PH 249), except that it affects multiple creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage Hand (Greater).MOD				DESC:A greater mage hand spell can lift an object and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the target up to 20 feet in any direction, although the spell ends if the distance between you and the subject ever exceeds the spell's range. A creature can negate the effect against an object it possesses with a successful Will save or if you fail to overcome its spell resistance. An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. The spell has an effective Strength of 10.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Fang (Superior).MOD			DESC:Superior magic fang gives every natural weapon you possess an enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Miasma.MOD					DESC:This potent spell conjures a cloud of mist that functions as a solid fog spell (PH 281). In addition, any spells cast within the fog have a -4 penalty to the spellcaster's caster level, and the save DC of any such spell is reduced by 2. Creatures within the fog, or that enter the fog, must succeed on a Will save or suffer the reduction in caster level and DC even after they leave the fog, for the duration of the spell. Material Component: A small piece of quilted cloth, which must be soaked in water while the spell is cast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Malevolent Miasma.MOD				DESC:The spell produces a toxic fog that deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per level (maximum 5d4). Creatures in the area that hold their breath are still subject to the effect. Creatures that are immune to poison are not affected by this spell. Focus: Three polished gray stones.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Make Manifest.MOD					DESC:You can cause one creature on a coexistent plane (DMG 150), along with its personal belongings, to suddenly appear on your plane of existence. An affected creature appears in the location analogous to the space it occupied on the coexistent plane. For example, the make manifest spell allows you to cause a target on the Ethereal Plane to appear on the Material Plane, and vice versa. This spell does not grant the ability to pinpoint the location of ethereal creatures. For the duration of the spell, the target creature retains all its abilities except for those that allow it to enter other planes. For example, a ghost brought in from the Ethereal Plane would be unable to return to the Ethereal Plane but would remain incorporeal. At the end of the spell's duration, the target creature returns to whatever plane it was on before it was targeted by the spell, even if it has moved beyond the range of make manifest.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Make Manifest (Mass).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like make manifest, except that all creatures and unattended objects on coterminous and coexistent planes within the area of this spell are instantly brought onto your plane. For the duration of the spell, the target creatures retain all their abilities except for those that allow them to enter other planes. At the end of mass make manifest's duration, objects and creatures return to their plane of origin, even if they have left the spell's area. Material Component: A handful of copper dust.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mantle of Chaos.MOD				DESC:The power of this spell grants you spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level against spells with the lawful descriptor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mantle of Evil.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like mantle of chaos, except that mantle of evil grants spell resistance against spells with the good descriptor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mantle of Good.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like mantle of chaos, except that mantle of good grants spell resistance against spells with the evil descriptor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mantle of the Icy Soul.MOD			DESC:The subject creature gains the cold subtype, granting it immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire (the creature takes half again as much damage from fire effects). A fire creature subjected to this spell does not gain the cold subtype, but it loses the fire subtype for the duration. Material Component: A pinch of sapphire dust worth 10 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mantle of Law.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like mantle of chaos, except that mantle of law grants spell resistance against spells with the chaotic descriptor.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Manyjaws.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, you summon several pairs of mystical, disembodied jaws that fly about and attack your foes. These pairs of jaws can be commanded to attack separate targets, or multiple pairs can be sent to attack a single foe. The jaws originate at your location and fly out to attack their targets, moving at a fly speed of 40 feet with perfect maneuverability. You can redirect as many of the jaws as you desire as a standard action. Each round on your action, each pair of jaws automatically hits its target and deals 1d6 points of damage, or half that amount with a successful Reflex save. A creature targeted by multiple pairs of jaws in a single round makes only one saving throw, with success halving the total damage. Material Component: A pair of teeth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mark of the Hunter.MOD				DESC:Your favored enemy bonuses against a foe with a mark of the hunter are 4 higher than they would otherwise be. Furthermore, the rune limns your enemy, making the foe easier for you to attack. The subject of a mark of the hunter spell gains no bonus to Armor Class against your attacks from any cover less than total cover, nor does it gain a miss chance against your attacks from any concealment less than total concealment. Other effects that grant a miss chance (such as incorporeality) work normally. Material Component: A bit of skin or bone from the relevant favored enemy type or subtype.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mark of the Outcast.MOD				DESC:This spell creates an indelible mark on the subject's face (or other upper body part, if the subject doesn't have a head). The mark is visible to normal vision, low-light vision, and darkvision. The wearer of such a mark takes a -5 circumstance penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks and a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Marked Object.MOD					DESC:Upon casting this spell, you become attuned to the specific creature that owns the spell's focus item. (A creature is considered to own an item if it was the last creature to carry the item on its person for 24 hours or more. You do not count when considering what creature was last to carry an item.) This attunement grants you a +10 bonus on Search and Survival checks made to track the item's owner or find evidence of the owner's passage. This spell does not give you insight into who or what the creature you are attuned to is or where that creature ultimately might be. Also, the spell does not provide a trail that is not already there nor provide you with the benefit of the Track feat. Arcane Focus: An object owned by the creature or a piece of the creature to be tracked, such as a tuft of hair or a fingernail.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Master Air.MOD					DESC:You sprout a pair of insubstantial feathery or batlike (your choice) wings. You can fly at a speed of 90 feet with good maneuverability (60 feet if you're wearing medium or heavy armor). Using master air requires as much concentration as walking, so you can attack or cast spells normally. You can charge but not run, and you cannot carry aloft more weight than your maximum load (PH 161), plus any armor you wear. Should the spell duration expire while you are still aloft, the magic fails slowly. You drop 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If you reach the ground in that amount of time, you land safely. If not, you fall the rest of the distance, taking falling damage normally. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, you also fall in this way if the master air spell is dispelled. Focus: A wing feather from any bird or the wing bone of any bat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Master Earth.MOD					DESC:You travel straight through the earth itself to a destination you choose. The movement is instantaneous and has no distance limitations (though the location must be on the same world). You need only think of where you want to go. If you don't think of an exact location, the earth carries you to the periphery of the general area you imagine. The earth never leaves you stranded inside it. It always puts you back to the surface even if it cannot deliver you to your chosen destination. It takes you as far as it can. Underground, creaturebuilt structures don't hinder you as long as you can move around them. This spell functions only on the Material Plane. Focus: The fossil of any animal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Master's Touch.MOD				DESC:You gain proficiency with a single weapon or shield you hold in your hands when the spell is cast. The lack of a somatic component means the spell can be cast in the middle of a fight while you keep ready whatever items stand between you and danger. Proficiency is granted for only a single, specific item, although multiple castings allow for multiple proficiencies. For example, if you hold a short sword and a rapier, with a buckler strapped to your off hand, you could cast the spell three times, once for each weapon and once for the shield. This spell does not grant proficiency for a kind or category of item (such as short swords) but only for the one specific item held in your hand at the time the spell is cast (this short sword). Should you set that item down or otherwise lose your grip on it, the proficiency does not transfer to a different item of the same kind you might pick up. However, if you recover the original item before the spell's effect runs out, you are still proficient with that specific weapon or shield for the duration. Focus: The item in whose use you wish to be proficient.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Maw of Chaos.MOD					DESC:All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of damage per caster level in the round when you cast the spell and each round thereafter at the start of your turn. Those damaged must also make a Will saving throw or be dazed for 1 round. Second, the chaotic energy makes it difficult to concentrate. Any activity that involves concentration (such as casting a spell or using a spell-like ability) requires a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to succeed. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are unaffected by this spell. Material Component: A jawbone with teeth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Maw of Stone.MOD					DESC:You cause a single natural opening or natural chamber to become animated. The opening or chamber cannot move, but it can attack. You can order it to attack any creature, or a specific type of creature. You also can order it to attack under a specific circumstance, such as when creatures try to leave or when they touch something. An animated opening can attack only creatures that try to move through it. An animated chamber can attack every creature inside. Only one maw of stone can be in effect on a particular opening or chamber at a time. The animated opening has an attack bonus equal to your level +10. The maw of stone deals damage equal to 2d8 points + your caster level. An animated opening can make one immediate attack against a creature passing through. If it succeeds, the target must make a Reflex save or it cannot pass through the maw. The animated stone has an Armor Class of 15 and hardness 8. Dealing 60 points of damage to it ends the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mechanus Mind.MOD					DESC:The subject gains a +4 resistance bonus on Will saving throws to resist mindaffecting spells and abilities. While in the grip of Mechanus mind, the subject also becomes more analytical and less emotional. The subject gains a +2 competence bonus on Intelligence- based checks, but takes a -2 penalty on Charisma-based checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Memory Rot.MOD					DESC:You create a cloud of spores that infests the brain of the subject creature, gradually destroying its mind. The spores deal 1d6 points of Intelligence damage immediately. The spores then gradually eat away at the subject's brain, dealing 1 point of Intelligence drain each round thereafter at the beginning of your turn. The subject can attempt a Fortitude save each round to combat the effect of the spores. A successful save ends the spores' advance and halts any further Intelligence drain.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mesmerizing Glare.MOD				DESC:Directing your gaze toward the target creatures, you cause them to stop and stare blankly at you. Creatures that fail their saving throws become fascinated.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Metal Melt.MOD					DESC:You alter the physical properties of a metal object so that it runs like water. The melted metal does not change temperature but flows as a liquid for 1 round and then returns to its normal solid state, usually in a form resembling a puddle. An item in a creature's possession is allowed a Will save, using the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. Material Component: A drop of mercury in a vial.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Miasma.MOD						DESC:By filling the subject's mouth and throat with unbreathable gas, you prevent it from doing much more than coughing and spitting. An affected creature cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, use breath weapons, or utter command words to activate magic items, but it can otherwise act normally. The subject can hold its breath for 2 rounds per point of Constitution but must make a Constitution check (DC 10 +1 per previous success) each round thereafter to continue doing so. Failure on any such check (or voluntary resumption of breathing) causes the subject to fall unconscious (0 hp). On the next round, the subject drops to -1 hit points and is dying; on the third round, it suffocates (DMG 304).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Miasma of Entropy.MOD				DESC:Miasma of entropy causes accelerated decay in all wood, leather, and other natural materials in the spell's area. It destroys nonmagical objects of wood, leather, paper, and other formerly living organic matter. All such objects within the area rot into slimy, pulpy masses. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per caster level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are ruined. Alternatively, you can target miasma of entropy against a single solid object of nonliving nonmagical organic matter that weighs up to 10 pounds per caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mind Poison.MOD					DESC:You infect the subject with a poison that saps willpower, dealing 1d10 points of Wisdom damage immediately and another 1d10 points of Wisdom damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Int or Cha modifier, for wizards or sorcerers, respectively. Material Component: A piece of a toadstool.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mindless Rage.MOD					DESC:the subject with so great a rage that it can do nothing but focus on engaging you in personal physical combat. The target must be able to see you when you cast this spell. If the subject later loses line of sight to you, the spell immediately ends. (A subject can't voluntarily break line of sight with you, such as by closing its eyes, to end this spell prematurely.) If the subject threatens you, it must make a full attack against you using a melee weapon or a natural weapon. If the subject doesn't threaten you at the start of its turn, it must move toward you (taking nothing but move actions) and end its movement as close to you as possible. If it gets close enough with a single move action to threaten you, it stops and makes a melee attack against you as normal. While under the effect of a mindless rage spell, the subject can make use of all its normal melee combat skills, abilities, and feats-either offensive or defensive. However, the subject can't make ranged attacks, cast spells, or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger, or spell completion to function. The subject can't make any attack against a creature other than you. The subject of this spell, though overcome with rage, is by no means rendered idiotic or suicidal. For example, an affected creature will not charge off a cliff in an attempt to reach you. An interesting side effect of mindless rage occurs when the spell affects any character or creature that has the rage ability (such as a barbarian). In these cases, the mindless rage spell automatically activates the creature's rage ability (and counts as one of the creature's uses of rage for that day). Focus: A scarlet handkerchief or similar piece of cloth, waved in the target's direction while you vocalize the verbal component.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Minor Disguise.MOD				DESC:You use magic to make minor, cosmetic changes in your appearance. The spell does not change the actual structure of either your features or body. It can add color to hair, paint wrinkles upon your face, give you a scar, or darken your teeth. This spell gives you a +2 competence bonus on the next Disguise check you make during its duration.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Miser's Envy.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, you designate a target creature and specify an object, both of which must be within the spell's range. If the target creature fails its saving throw, it becomes consumed by a powerful desire for the object. For the duration of the spell, the creature seeks to obtain the object (going so far as to attack anyone holding or wearing it). Once the creature gains possession of the object, it protects the item greedily, attacking anyone who approaches within 30 feet or who otherwise appears to be trying to take the object away. If no one approaches within 30 feet or seems interested in trying to take the object, the subject can act normally. Dragons, due to their greedy nature, take a -4 penalty on their saving throws against this spell. Material Component: A copper piece.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moment of Clarity.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell and touch a creature that is under the influence of a mind-affecting spell or ability, that creature immediately receives another saving throw against the effect's original DC to break free of the effect. If the spell or ability did not originally permit a saving throw, this spell has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Monstrous Thrall.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like true domination (page 224), except that the subject can be any creature and is permanently dominated if it fails its initial Will save. A subject ordered to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw with a -4 penalty to resist taking that particular action. If the save succeeds, the subject still remains your thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moon Blade.MOD					DESC:You call a swordlike beam of moonlight into your hand. Anyone who can cast moon blade can wield the beam with proficiency. However, if you are profi- cient with any type of sword, you can wield the beam as if it were any type of sword and thus gain the benefits of any special sword skill you might have, such as Weapon Focus. Attacks with a moon blade are melee touch attacks. Its strike saps vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds but dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (to a maximum of +10) to any type of creature except undead. Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade. Their substance boils away from its touch, and they take 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +20) per blow. The blade is immaterial, and your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the target's next turn after a hit from a moon blade, the creature must make a Concentration check to use any spell or spell-like ability. The DC is equal to 10 + damage dealt + spell level. (An opponent hit by a moon blade while casting a spell must make the usual Concentration check to avoid losing the spell in addition to the check on its next turn.) Arcane Material Component: A small candy made with wintergreen oil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moon Bolt.MOD					DESC:You call a swordlike beam of moonlight into your hand. Anyone who can cast moon blade can wield the beam with proficiency. However, if you are profi- cient with any type of sword, you can wield the beam as if it were any type of sword and thus gain the benefits of any special sword skill you might have, such as Weapon Focus. Attacks with a moon blade are melee touch attacks. Its strike saps vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds but dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per two caster levels (to a maximum of +10) to any type of creature except undead. Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade. Their substance boils away from its touch, and they take 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (to a maximum of +20) per blow. The blade is immaterial, and your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the target's next turn after a hit from a moon blade, the creature must make a Concentration check to use any spell or spell-like ability. The DC is equal to 10 + damage dealt + spell level. (An opponent hit by a moon blade while casting a spell must make the usual Concentration check to avoid losing the spell in addition to the check on its next turn.) Arcane Material Component: A small candy made with wintergreen oil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moon Lust.MOD					DESC:This spell instills in the target an obsessive fascination with the moon. If the target fails its save, it fixates on the moon, staring at the moon or imagining it in its mind, and is considered fascinated for the duration of the spell. If the saving throw is successful, the subject is instead dazzled for the duration of the spell. Sightless creatures are not affected by this spell. Focus: A silver ingot worth 5 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moon Path.MOD					DESC:Moon path allows you to create a stair or bridge from one spot to another. The effect is a railless ribbon of glowing white translucent force like a glass strip. The strip can be from 3 to 20 feet wide as you decide. (You can vary the width over the ribbon's length if you want.) It sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are in midair. At the time of casting, you designate up to one creature per caster level to receive extra protection while standing on or moving along the moon path. Protected creatures gain the benefit of a sanctuary effect. This functions like the 1st-level spell sanctuary except that the save DC is 15 + your Wis modifier, and any subject of the spell who attacks breaks the sanctuary effect for all subjects. Protected creatures also stick to the top of the moon path as though they have received spider climb spells. A creature loses both benefits immediately when it leaves the path. Unlike a wall of force, a moon path can be dispelled. It is otherwise similar to a wall of force in that it needs no supports and it is immune to damage of all kinds. A disintegrate spell blasts a hole in the path 10 feet square, leaving the rest of the path intact. (If the moon path is 10 feet wide or less, this merely creates a 10-foot gap.) A hit from a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction destroys a moon path. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a moon path, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material creatures. Gaze attacks cannot operate through a moon path. A moon path must be straight, continuous, and unbroken when formed. If its surface would be interrupted by any object or creature, the spell fails. The bridge version of the spell must be created flat. The stair version cannot rise or descend any more sharply than 45 degrees. Arcane Material Component: A white handkerchief.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moonbeam.MOD					DESC:On your turn each round, you can change the direction the cone of light points. Light from a moonbeam spell does not adversely affect creatures that are sensitive to light, but lycanthropes in humanoid form caught in the cone must make a Will save to avoid involuntarily assuming their animal forms. A lycanthrope in animal form can change out of it on the creature's next turn (spending a round in animal form). However, if it is still in the area of the spell, it must succeed on a Will save to do so. Once a lycanthrope successfully saves against moonbeam, it is not affected by any more of your moonbeam spells for 24 hours. Moonbeam penetrates any darkness spell of equal or lower level, but does not counter or dispel it. Darkness spells of higher level block a moonbeam. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of white powder.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moonbow.MOD						DESC:This spell conjures three glowing motes of electricity. You direct any number of the motes to fly off and strike targets within the spell's range. Multiple motes can be fired at the same target, or each can be sent against a separate target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with a mote to strike a target. Any creature struck by a mote takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). If you do not immediately fire all the motes created by the spell, you can choose to fire as many of the remaining ones as you wish as a standard action during the next round. If a round passes in which you do not fire one of your motes, the spell ends and all remaining motes vanish. Material Component: A small piece of moonstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Moonfire.MOD					DESC:Living creatures in the area of a moonfire spell feel an unnatural chill and take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8). Undead and shapechangers take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8). This application of the spell allows a Reflex save for half damage. All magical auras within the cone glow with a faint blue light for 1 round per caster level. Disguised, shapechanged, or polymorphed creatures and objects in the spell's area at the time the spell is cast must make Will saves or immediately return to their normal forms. Even if the save succeeds, they remain covered in ghostly white outlines that show their true forms for 1 round per caster level. The entire area covered by the cone glows silver-white for 1 round per caster level. This radiance is as bright as the light of a full moon and negates electricity damage for 1 round per caster level unless the item or creature generating the electricity effect makes a caster level check (1d20 + item's caster level or creature's caster level) against a DC equal to 10 + your caster level. If an electricity effect is generated outside the glowing cone, the cone blocks the electricity effect unless the creature generating the effect succeeds on a caster level check. If an electricity effect is generated inside the glowing cone, the cone negates the electricity effect unless the creature generating the effect succeeds on a caster level check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mountain Stance.MOD				DESC:While this spell is in effect, the subject can root itself to the ground as a free action. The subject gains a bonus equal to your caster level against any attempts to grapple, lift, push, bull rush, overrun, throw, trip, or otherwise force the subject to move against its will through either physical or magical means. If at any point such an effort succeeds and the subject is forced to move, the spell ends immediately. Any voluntary movement on the subject's part does not end the spell (although a creature cannot be rooted while it moves), and the subject can "reroot" itself elsewhere in the same manner as described above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Murderous Mist.MOD				DESC:You create a cloud of scalding hot steam that moves in a straight line, away from you, at a speed of 10 feet per round. Anyone within the cloud takes 2d6 points of damage and is permanently blinded. If a creature within the area makes a successful Reflex saving throw, it takes only half damage and is not blinded. Any creature within the cloud has concealment. Winds do not affect the cloud's direction or speed. However, a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nature's Avatar.MOD				DESC:The affected animal gains a +10 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and 1d8 temporary hit points per caster level, plus the effect of a haste spell (PH 239).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nature's Balance.MOD				DESC:You take a -4 penalty to your choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and your subject gains an equivalent bonus to the same ability score. You get no saving throw to avoid the loss, but your subject can attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the gain, if desired.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nature's Favor.MOD				DESC:You take a -4 penalty to your choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and your subject gains an equivalent bonus to the same ability score. You get no saving throw to avoid the loss, but your subject can attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the gain, if desired.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nature's Rampart.MOD				DESC:You shape a natural setting into a formidable defensive position. Usually this spell is used to prepare an open outdoor area such as a hillside or a forest, but a large natural cavern could be shaped into a divine rampart. Artificial structures or features are not affected, although nature's rampart could be positioned to fill a gap between two buildings or barricade an unpaved road. The effect of the spell depends on the terrain: Open Outdoor Site: A rampart or dike of earth 5 feet high and 5 feet thick at its base rises immediately behind a shallow ditch 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep along the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the dike receive cover. Attackers approaching on foot must scramble down into the ditch and then climbing 10 feet to reach the top of the dike (Climb DC 10). Rough Outdoor Site or Cavern: Loose stones and boulders, dead wood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall 5 feet high and 2 feet thick at the base around the perimeter of the site. Creatures behind the wall receive cover. Marshy or Low-Lying Site: In areas such as marsh, bog, swamp, or tundra, nature's rampart cannot raise a wall, but instead creates a water-filled ditch 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep. Creatures forced to wade the ditch are reduced to 1/4 their normal speed (minimum 5 feet) and cannot charge or run. Focus: A small quartz gem engraved with the image of an exquisite tiny castle, worth at least 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Naturewatch.MOD					DESC:This spell is similar to deathwatch (PH 217), but it functions only on animals and plants. In addition, it also allows you to determine a variety of other mundane information about the animals and plants (whether or not the plants are dehydrated, the animals are malnourished, and so forth).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nauseating Breath.MOD				DESC:You breathe out a cone of nauseating vapors. Any creature in the area must succeed on a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Material Component: A piece of fish at least one day old.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Negative Energy Aura.MOD			DESC:Each round on your turn, every living creature within 10 feet of you loses 1 hit point per three caster levels (maximum 5). Undead creatures instead gain 2 hit points per round (though they can't exceed their full normal hit point total from this effect). Characters with immunity to negative energy effects are not affected by this aura. The aura does not affect you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nerveskitter.MOD					DESC:You cast this spell when you and your party roll for initiative. You enhance the subject's reactions in combat, granting it a +5 bonus on its initiative check for the current encounter. If the subject does not make an initiative check within 1 round, this spell has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Net of Shadows.MOD				DESC:This spell gives the subjects concealment, but the shifting magic shadows also inhibit the subjects' ability to ascertain their surroundings. The subjects can see only 5 feet through the shadows that coat them, and foes within that range have concealment from the subjects. Darkvision does not penetrate a net of shadows.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nightmare Lullaby.MOD				DESC:This spell gives the subjects concealment, but the shifting magic shadows also inhibit the subjects' ability to ascertain their surroundings. The subjects can see only 5 feet through the shadows that coat them, and foes within that range have concealment from the subjects. Darkvision does not penetrate a net of shadows.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Night's Caress.MOD				DESC:Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and 1d6+2 points of Constitution damage. (A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Constitution damage.) The spell has a special effect on an undead creature. An undead touched by you takes no damage or Constitution loss, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds +1 round per caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nightshield.MOD					DESC:This spell provides a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws; this resistance bonus increases to +2 at caster level 6th and +3 at caster level 9th. In addition, the spell negates magic missile attacks directed at you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nightstalker's Transformation.MOD		DESC:You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +3 luck bonus to Armor Class, a +5 luck bonus on Reflex saving throws, a +5 competence bonus on Spot, Listen, Hide, and Move Silently checks, and proficiency with all simple weapons plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. You also gain the Weapon Finesse feat and the evasion ability (PH 50). You deal an extra 3d6 points of damage whenever you attack an opponent that you flank or an opponent denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. This extra damage works like the rogue's sneak attack ability. You lose your spellcasting ability for the duration of the spell, including your ability to use spell trigger or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list. Material Component: A potion of cat's grace, which you drink (and whose effect is subsumed by this spell's effect).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nimbus of Light.MOD				DESC:The nimbus of light around you glows like a lantern, providing bright illumination in a 30-foot radius (and shadowy illumination for an additional 30 feet) from you. As a move action, you can coalesce the energy from a nimbus of light around your outstretched arm, and then as a standard action fling it toward a foe within 30 feet. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the energy to strike a target. A nimbus of light deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per round that has elapsed since you cast the spell (maximum 1d8 + caster level). Attacking with a nimbus of light ends the spell, whether your ranged touch attack is successful or not.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Nixie's Grace.MOD					DESC:This potent spell infuses you with powerful fey magic, granting you many of the traits and abilities of a nixie (MM 235). Upon casting this spell, you gain a swim speed of 30 feet. You can breathe underwater, and you gain low-light vision and damage reduction 5/cold iron. You also gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, and a +8 enhancement bonus to Charisma. Focus: A lock of nixie's hair, freely given to you by a nixie.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Obedient Avalanche.MOD				DESC:An obedient avalanche spell affects creatures differently, depending on where they are in relation to the avalanche. Within 20 feet of the Center Point: Creatures take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d8) and an additional 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels. A successful Reflex save halves the damage. Creatures who fail their saves are also buried (DMG 90). All squares within 20 feet of the center point are covered in heavy snow (DMG 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would. A buried creature can free itself with a DC 20 Strength check as a full-round action, and can be dug free by others (a single creature working alone requires 1 minute to free a trapped creature). A trapped creature is unable to move, and cannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material components must be in hand. Between 20 feet and 40 feet of the Center Point: Creatures take half as much damage from the impact of the avalanche as the creatures nearer the center point took (Reflex negates). Creatures who fail their saves must also resist the force of the snow moving past them as if they were being bull rushed. The snow has a +13 attack bonus (+5 for effective Strength of 20 and +8 for effectively being Huge) on the bull rush check, and it pushes characters away from the center point of the spell. All squares in the 20-foot to 40-foot ring are covered in snow (DMG 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would. Terrain and Structures: The avalanche uproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of light rubble (DMG 91) even after the snow melts. Structures struck by an obedient avalanche take 1d6?10 points of damage. An obedient avalanche extinguishes all flames it touches, whether they are normal or magical.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Omen of Peril.MOD					DESC:Based on an assessment of your immediate surroundings and chosen path of travel, you receive one of three visions that reflect the next hour's journey: safety, peril, or great danger. The base chance for receiving an accurate reply is 70%% +1%% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%%; the DM makes the roll secretly. If the omen of peril is successful, you get one of three visions, which lasts just a second or two. . Safety: You aren't in any immediate danger. If you continue on your present course (or remain where you are if you have been stationary for some time before casting the spell), you will face no significant monsters, traps, or other challenges for the next hour or so. . Peril: You will face challenges typical of an adventure: challenging but not overwhelming monsters, dangerous traps, and other hazards for the next hour or so. . Great Danger: Your very life is at grave risk. You will likely face powerful NPCs or deadly traps in the next hour. If the roll fails, you get one of the two incorrect results, determined randomly by the DM, and you don't necessarily know that you failed because the DM rolls secretly. Choosing which vision is "correct" takes some educated guesswork on the part of the DM, who should assess the characters' likely courses of action and what dangers they're likely to face. The exact form that an omen of peril takes depends on whether you worship a specific deity, venerate nature as a druid, or simply uphold abstract principles. A druid might see a white dove for safety, a dark cloud obscuring the sun for peril, and a forest fire for great danger. A cleric of Fharlanghn might get a vision of a straight road for safety, a crossroads for peril, and a washed-out bridge for great danger. Unlike the more powerful augury spell (PH 202), an omen of peril doesn't respond to a specific question. It indicates only the level of danger likely for the next hour, not what form the danger will take. Focus: A set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
One withthe Land.MOD				DESC:You forge a strong link with nature that gives you greater insight into your environment. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Handle Animal, Hide, Move Silently, Search, Survival, and wild empathy checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
One Mind.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like lesser one mind, except as noted here, and in addition it allows you and your special mount to predict each other's movements, giving you a significant edge in combat. You and your mount both gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls as long as you are mounted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
One Mind (Greater).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like one mind, except as noted here, and in addition you and your mount gain a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls as long as you are mounted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
One Mind (Lesser).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like one mind, except as noted here, and in addition you and your mount gain a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls as long as you are mounted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ooze Puppet.MOD					DESC:You telekinetically take control of the targeted ooze, manipulating it and forcing it to move and attack as you see fit. You can force the ooze to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. Controlling the ooze's actions for an entire round is a move action for you. When the ooze is not directed to move, attack, or undertake any actions by you, telekinetic force holds it immobile. Once control is established, you must have line of sight to the ooze to manipulate it, but distance is not otherwise a factor, unless you and the ooze are on different planes (at which point the spell ends). If a controlled ooze splits, such as a black pudding (MM 201) struck by a slashing weapon, you retain control of only one of the resultant oozes (choose randomly).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Opalescent Glare.MOD				DESC:Inspired by the deadly gaze of the noble ghaele eladrin, you gain a gaze attack usable against creatures within 60 feet. If an evil creature with 5 or fewer Hit Dice meets your gaze (DMG 294), it dies unless it succeeds on a Will save. Even if the save succeeds, the creature is affected as though by a fear spell (PH 229) for 2d10 rounds. Non-evil creatures and evil creatures with more than 5 Hit Dice are not slain by the gaze, and they suffer the fear effect only if they fail the Will save.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Acid.MOD					DESC:An orb of acid about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the orb takes damage and becomes sickened by the acid's noxious fumes for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect but does not reduce the damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Acid (Lesser).MOD			DESC:An orb of acid about 2 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d8 points of acid damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, your orb deals an additional 1d8 points of damage: 2d8 at 3rd level, 3d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 7th level, and the maximum of 5d8 at 9th level or higher.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Cold.MOD					DESC:An orb of cold about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the orb takes damage and becomes blinded by the cold for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the cold effect but does not reduce the damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Cold (Lesser).MOD			DESC:An orb of cold about 2 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d8 points of cold damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, your orb deals an additional 1d8 points of damage: 2d8 at 3rd level, 3d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 7th level, and the maximum of 5d8 at 9th level or higher.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Electricity.MOD				DESC:An orb of electricity about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the orb takes damage and, if wearing metal armor must make a Fortitude save or be entangled for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the entangle effect but does not reduce the damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Electricity (Lesser).MOD		DESC:An orb of electricity about 2 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d8 points of electricity damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, your orb deals an additional 1d8 points of damage: 2d8 at 3rd level, 3d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 7th level, and the maximum of 5d8 at 9th level or higher.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Fire.MOD					DESC:An orb of fire about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the orb takes damage and becomes dazed by the fire for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the daze effect but does not reduce the damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Fire (Lesser).MOD			DESC:An orb of fire about 2 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, your orb deals an additional 1d8 points of damage: 2d8 at 3rd level, 3d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 7th level, and the maximum of 5d8 at 9th level or higher.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Force.MOD					DESC:You create a globe of force 3 inches across, which streaks from your palm toward your target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit the target. The orb deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Sound.MOD					DESC:An orb of sound about 3 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d4). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. A creature struck by the orb takes damage and becomes deafened by the sound for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the deafening effect but does not reduce the damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Orb of Sound (Lesser).MOD			DESC:An orb of sound about 2 inches across shoots from your palm at its target, dealing 1d6 points of sonic damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, your orb deals an additional 1d6 points of damage: 2d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 7th level, and the maximum of 5d6 at 9th level or higher.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Otyugh Swarm.MOD					DESC:Otyugh swarm creates otyughs from a large collection of refuse and filth, such as a sewer or cesspool. You can choose to create 3d4 ordinary otyughs (MM 204) or 1d3+1 Huge otyughs with 15 HD (MM 292). The otyughs willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. They remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them. If the otyughs are created only for guard duty, the duration of the spell is seven months. In this case, the otyughs must be ordered to guard only a specific site or location. Otyughs summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range. You must create the otyughs in an area containing at least 6,000 pounds of sewage, refuse, or offal. After you cast the spell, otyughs not summoned for guard duty can leave the area of offal at your command.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Owl's Insight.MOD					DESC:The subject gains an insight bonus to Wisdom equal to 1/2 your caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Panacea.MOD						DESC:This spell channels positive energy into a creature to wipe away its afflictions. It immediately ends any of the following conditions affecting the subject: blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, sickened, and stunned. It negates sleep effects and the effect of the feeblemind spell, and ends any additional effects from poison, as the neutralize poison spell. It also cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Panacea does not remove ability damage, negative levels, or drained levels. Used against an undead creature, panacea deals damage instead of curing the creature (which takes half damage if it makes a Will saving throw), but it has no other effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Pavilion of Grandeur.MOD			DESC:You conjure up a grand pavilion-sized tent that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 10 feet wide by 15 feet high. Only those you designate can enter the pavilion, and the entrance is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You can open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a spacious tent decorated in the colors of your faith. The lighting can vary between darkness and daylight, and the temperature between 40 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, at your discretion when casting the spell. The pavilion is sumptuously furnished, including a full meal for a dozen creatures per caster level. Anyone who spends 1 hour dining here gains benefits identical to those of a heroes' feast spell (PH 240). While in the pavilion, creatures heal naturally at double the normal rate (not including fast healing or regeneration).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Perinarch.MOD					DESC:This spell grants temporary control over the terrain of Limbo. Normally, unless controlled, the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo (DMG 158) is just what the plane's name implies: a roiling soup of energy and elements. Natives learn to control it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed some measure of control for a long period, but visitors to areas of "raw" limbo must make a DC 16 Wisdom check to gain control over the dangerous roil. The perinarch spell gives you automatic control of a radius of raw Limbo (an area not already stabilized or within some other creature's control) in close range. Control allows you to reshape the raw limbo as you desire, adding or subtracting one of the four basic elements once per round as a standard action. A favorite among travelers from the Material Plane is a chunk of earth surrounded by a small atmosphere of air. The effect of this spell overlaps with the control already (potentially) established with a Wisdom check. Your allies can give their control over to you concurrently with the spell being cast, if they so choose. Control cannot be wrested away from you while the spell is in effect (which is one of the best reasons to cast this spell, even if you have a high Wisdom). If you move more than 100 feet away from the area that you controlled, the order you imposed fades away. You are unable to achieve any works of complexity within an area you control, but you can mix two or three elements in a crude fashion; a few examples are provided below. You can attempt to seize control of a new area that already contains foes; however, foes can make a Reflex save to get out of the area. Thick Barrier: You can "thicken" empty air with dust and rock, creating a zone around yourself and your allies that outside creatures must hack or force a way through. Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. Fiery Barrier: You can create a thick field of flame that deals 3d10 points of fire damage to any creature attempting to pass through it. The field also deals 3d10 points of fire damage for each round a creature lingers within it. Complete Barrier: You can create a complete barrier of solid stone up to 1 foot thick encircling yourself and your allies, preventing access by any other than the most accomplished tunnelers. On the other hand, you can attempt to trap foes within their own bubble of solid stone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Perinarch (Planar).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like perinarch, except that you can cast this spell on any highly morphic or divinely morphic plane (DMG 148).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Persistent Blade.MOD				DESC:You bring into being a tiny blade of force. The blade flies at a speed of 40 feet (perfect) and attacks any target within its range, as you desire, starting in the round when you cast the spell. The blade attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + 1/2 your Cha modifier or Int modifier (for sorcerers and wizards, respectively) and deals 1d4 points of damage, with a critical threat range of 19-20. If an ally also attacks the creature, the blade moves on your turn to flank the target. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. The blade cannot be attacked. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the blade to a new target; otherwise, it continues to attack the same target. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the persistent blade strikes. If the blade is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the blade has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. Focus: A silvered dagger.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantasmal Assailants.MOD			DESC:You create phantasmal images of nightmare creatures in the target's mind, visible only as shadowy shapes to you and unseen by all others. If the target succeeds on an initial Will save, it recognizes that the images are not real, and the spell fails. If not, the phantasms strike the target, dealing 8 points of Wisdom damage and 8 points of Dexterity damage (4 points each on a successful Fortitude save). If the subject of a phantasmal assailant succeeds in disbelieving and is wearing a helm of telepathy, the spell can be turned back upon you with the same effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantasmal Decoy.MOD				DESC:You create a phantasmal image of the subject's most hated enemy by sifting through the subconscious mind of the subject. Only you and the spell's subject can see the phantasmal creature, and the phantasm seems blurry and indistinct to you. If the target fails its Will saving throw, you designate a space that the phantasm appears to occupy. The subject must attack the phantasm, or move to be adjacent to it. A creature that attacks the phantasm is allowed an additional saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If moving up to the phantasm would cause the subject to cross dangerous terrain (such as a pool of lava), it does not move to be adjacent to the phantasm. It merely moves as close as it can and takes no further actions unless the phantasm moves to a space it can reach. As a move action, you can move a phantasmal decoy up to 60 feet in any direction. Because it's not real, a phantasmal decoy isn't affected by terrain that slows movement (although you can slow its progress voluntarily if you like to help maintain the facade of realism).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantasmal Disorientation.MOD			DESC:The target of a phantasmal disorientation spell must make a Will save after this spell is cast to discern true landmarks from phantasmal ones. If the save succeeds, the creature moves and acts normally. If the save fails, it instead moves in a direction 90 degrees to either side (equal chance of going left or right), and cannot target any creature with ranged attacks or ranged spells. Because of the disorientation, the subject doesn't realize it's headed in the wrong direction until it meaningfully interacts with its environment (by making an attack or manipulating an object such as a door, for example). For the duration of the spell, an affected creature must succeed on a Will save each round to move normally. A phantasmal disorientation spell affects only the direction of movement and attacks made at range. Creatures subject to it can still make melee attacks, cast personal or touch spells, or otherwise act normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantasmal Thief.MOD				DESC:An invisible force, not unlike the product of an unseen servant spell (PH 297), comes into being where you wish. On your turn, this force steals objects from others as you inaudibly direct it (a free action). A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature or can pick up an unattended object, as long as the object weighs no more than 1 pound per caster level. It cannot break into locked chests. A phantasmal thief has a Hide modifier (useful against those who can see invisible creatures) and a Move Silently modifier both equal to your caster level. If a phantasmal thief goes undetected, it can steal any object a creature possesses but is not holding or wearing. Even objects in a bag of holding can be stolen. It can steal objects, bring objects to you, or put them back where they came from. It can take no other actions. A phantasmal thief needs 1 round to steal an object and another round to bring it to you. A phantasmal thief can hold only one object at a time, and the object becomes invisible in its grasp. A thief cannot take an item if it is detected by the creature it's trying to steal from (with a Listen or Spot check). However, the thief can repeat the attempt in the next round. It cannot be harmed in any way, although it can be dispelled. A phantasmal thief can steal an object from a creature's hand by making a successful disarm attempt. It does so with a bonus on the disarm check equal to your caster level. If a phantasmal thief is used in this way, it disappears after it brings the stolen object to you. Material Component: A spool of green thread.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Bear.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like phantom wolf (page 157), except that you conjure an incorporeal bear with a fearsome roar.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Foe.MOD					DESC:If the target creature fails its saving throw, this spell creates in the subject's mind an illusory double of whichever creature currently threatens it that it deems most dangerous. The form of this phantom foe changes as appropriate whenever the target perceives a different threatening creature more dangerous than the last. This illusory double provides two effects. First, the subject believes it is being flanked by the phantom foe and the real creature the foe duplicates. Thus, the duplicated creature is always considered to be flanking the subject in melee. A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this aspect of the spell. Second, the subject of the spell is unable to determine that the phantom foe is not a real threat, and whenever the subject attempts to attack the creature duplicated by the phantom foe, that creature benefits from a 50%% miss chance against attacks from the subject of the spell. Because this miss chance comes from the subject's inability to tell the phantom foe from the original, it is rolled separately from any miss chance that applies due to displacement or concealment. Creatures other than the subject cannot see the phantom foe, although they can attempt to guess its location by how the target acts. If the subject is not threatened by any creature at the start of its turn, the spell ends. Focus: A tiny pewter figure of a warrior that is worth 10 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Stag.MOD					DESC:You conjure a Large, corporeal staglike creature that bears you or a person you designate into combat or overland at great speed. A phantom stag has a black body and head with sharp, silvery antlers, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has no saddle, bridle, or bit, but it is exceptionally alert to the nudges and balance changes of its rider. The phantom stag has an AC of 20 (-1 size, +6 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 40 hit points +5 hit points per caster level. It attacks with its antlers at a +10 bonus, dealing 1d8+9 points of damage (doubled on a successful charge). It can also trample Medium or smaller foes, who must succeed on a Reflex save (18 + 1/2 your caster level) or take 1d6+9 points of damage as the stag moves through their space. A phantom stag has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 300 feet. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level in other gear. It ignores terrain elements such as undergrowth, rubble, or mud that would slow its movement. Phantom stags gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those associated with any lower caster levels. 12th Level: The phantom stag can use air walk at will (as the spell, PH 196, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground. The phantom stag gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. 14th Level: The phantom stag can fly at its speed (average maneuverability). The phantom stag gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC. 16th Level: The phantom stag's antlers have the ghost touch (DMG 224) and wounding (DMG 226) weapon special abilities. The phantom stag gains a +6 deflection bonus to AC. 18th Level: The phantom stag can use etherealness on behalf of its rider (as the spell, PH 228, caster level 18th). The phantom stag gains a +8 deflection bonus to AC.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Threat.MOD				DESC:You create the sensation in the subject's mind that it is threatened by more foes than it actually faces. Though the subject doesn't actually perceive any additional enemies (and thus doesn't waste any attacks on the phantasm), a creature affected by this spell is considered flanked, even if not threatened by other creatures. No amount of convincing by others can help the subject of this spell avoid its effect-only a successful saving throw against the spell when initially cast can help the target. A creature that can't be flanked is immune to this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Phantom Wolf.MOD					DESC:You conjure forth an incorporeal white wolf with abnormally large, frosty jaws. This phantom wolf follows your mental commands, acting on your behalf as long as it remains within range and you continue to concentrate on it. A phantom wolf appears where you designate and acts as you direct on your turn. You don't need to maintain line of effect once the spell is cast, but the spell ends if the phantom wolf is ever outside the spell's range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plague of Rats.MOD				DESC:You summon a number of rat swarms (MM 239)-one per two caster levels-to a maximum of six swarms at 12th level. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). You can summon the rat swarms so that they share the spaces of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its space. If no living creatures are within its space, a swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. You have no control over its target or direction of travel.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plague of Undead.MOD				DESC:This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons (MM 225) or zombies (MM 265) with maximum hit points for their Hit Dice. If you can control them, these undead follow your spoken commands. The undead remain animated until destroyed (a destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again). Regardless of the specific numbers or kinds of undead created with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead with this spell than four times your caster level with a single casting of plague of undead. The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell or animate dead (PH 198), however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. The limit imposed by this spell and the animate dead spell are the same, meaning that creatures you animate with either spell count against this limit. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings of this spell or animate dead become uncontrolled. Any time you must release part of the undead that you control because of this spell or animate dead, you choose which undead are released until the total HD of undead you control is equal to four times your caster level. The bones and bodies required for this spell follow the same restrictions as animate dead. Material Component: A black sapphire worth 100 gp or several black sapphires with a total value of 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Planar Bubble.MOD					DESC:This spell creates an area around the subject creature that emulates its native planar environment. Thus, a character hailing from the Material Plane would have normal gravity, temperature, magic, and so on. This spell cast on a native of the Plane of Shadow (DMG 152) would make the area around the creature mimic its home plane's normal gravity, a mild neutral alignment, enhanced shadow spells, and impeded light or fire spells. Arcane Material Component: A sprinkling of silver dust.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Planar Exchange.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar exchange, except as noted here. You trade places with an avoral guardinal (MM 141), bone devil (MM 52), or babau demon (MM 40). The called creature has full access to all its abilities, with one exception: A demon or devil you conjure can't summon other creatures. If the creature is slain, you take 3d6 points of damage and the spell ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Planar Exchange (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar exchange, except as noted here. You trade places with a leonal guardinal (MM 142), barbed devil (MM 51), or hezrou demon (MM 44). The called creature has full access to all its abilities, with one exception: A demon or devil you conjure can't summon other creatures. If the creature is slain, you take 4d6 points of damage and the spell ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Planar Exchange (Lesser).MOD			DESC:When you cast this spell, you call a celestial brown bear (MM 269), celestial griffon (MM 139), fiendish dire ape (MM 62), or fiendish tiger (MM 281), at your option, to your precise location. At the same instant, you are transported to that creature's home plane, where you exist in stasis for the duration of the spell. To a casual observer, it appears that you have transformed into the called creature (though an onlooker who makes a DC 25 Spot check notices the slight gap in time between your disappearance and the creature's appearance). If the called creature would not fit in the place you occupied when you cast the spell, the spell fails. If the called creature is slain, you take 2d6 points of damage, the spell ends, and you are returned to your origin plane in the space last occupied by the called creature. A celestial creature (MM 31) called by this spell gains damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance equal to its HD +5; and a smite evil attack that provides a bonus equal to its HD on one damage roll. A fiendish creature (MM 107) called by this spell gains damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance equal to its HD +5; and a smite good attack that provides a bonus equal to its HD on one damage roll. You have full control over the creature's actions and can perceive the environment around the called creature as if you were seeing through its eyes, hearing through its ears, and so on. While in stasis, you can't take any actions other than to control the called creature or to dismiss the spell, nor can anything on the creature's home plane affect you in any way. You also can't perceive anything around your body's location. When you dismiss the spell, or when the creature is slain, you appear in the creature's location, and it is returned to its home plane. When you use a calling spell that calls a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful creature, it is a spell of that type.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Planar Tolerance.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like avoid planar effects (page 19), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plane Shift (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like plane shift (PH 262), except that if you have visited the desired location, the spell takes you to the precise location (rather than 5 to 500 miles distant).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Plant Body.MOD					DESC:You imbue yourself with powerful transformative magic, gaining some of the characteristics of the plant type. Any spell or effect that would affect plant creatures also affects you, for the duration of plant body. When subject to this spell, you are immune to extra damage from critical hits, mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. Your ability scores, skills, and feats are unaffected (although your new form might make it difficult or impossible for you to use certain skills or feats).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Poison Thorns.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like thornskin (page 219), except as noted above, and a scratch from the thorns is sufficient to deliver a dose of poison to your attacker. Any creature grappling you is exposed to the poison each round at the start of your turn. The poison from the thorns deals 1d4 points of Strength damage immediately and another 1d4 points of Strength damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Wis modifier). Material Component: A dried black rose.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Poison Vines.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like vine mine (page 230), except that the vines you create are poisonous (contact, 1d6 Dex/2d6 Dex). A successful Fortitude save is required only upon the first entry into the spell's area (and again 1 minute later); creatures don't have to save each time they enter (or each round they remain within). You are immune to the poison of the vines you create, and you can select a number of other targets equal to your caster level to share this immunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Portal Alarm.MOD					DESC:Portal alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size passes through the magic gate or portal the spell is cast upon. You decide at the time of casting whether the portal alarm will be mental or audible. Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) as long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area and on the same plane. You notice a mental tremor that would awaken you from a normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration (it would not interfere with spellcasting). A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm. Audible Alarm: An audible portal alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, buzzer, or other similar repeating sound that can be heard clearly up to 60 feet away, and it pierces closed doors and extends onto other planes. The ringing can be heard faintly up to 180 feet away and lasts for 1 round. Creatures within the area of a silence spell cannot hear the ringing, and if the portal itself is within the area of a silence spell, no alarm is sounded. Ethereal and astral creatures trigger a portal alarm if they pass through the portal. You can set a portal alarm with a password, determined at the time of the casting, and this password can be discerned with the analyze portal spell (page 10). Those speaking the password before passing through the portal do not set off the alarm. Material Component: A tiny bell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Portal Alarm (Improved).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like portal alarm, with the following additions. . You can designate the alarm set off by an improved portal alarm to be mental, audible, or both. . If a mental alarm is chosen, you receive a mental picture of all creatures that have passed through the portal and which direction they passed through. The mental image provides information as if you were standing 10 feet away from the portal. . You can enable another creature to receive the mental alarm instead of yourself. You must touch the creature, which receives a Will saving throw to negate the effect, if applicable. Focus: A small leather pouch containing three brass bells.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Portal Beacon.MOD					DESC:You alter a magic gate or portal so it sends out a mental beacon for up to six creatures, including yourself if you choose. These individuals must be known to you but need not be present at the time of casting. Once you cast portal beacon, these creatures know the direction and distance to the targeted portal for the spell's duration. Moving to a plane other than the two connected by the portal ends the spell for that creature but leaves it intact for others. You can have any number of portal beacons tuned to you without impairing other abilities or actions.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Positive Energy Aura.MOD			DESC:Each round on your turn, every living creature within 10 feet of you gains 1 hit point per three caster levels (maximum 5). Creatures can't exceed their full normal hit point totals as a result of this effect. Undead creatures take 2 points of damage per round. Characters with immunity to positive energy effects are not affected by this aura. A positive energy aura does not affect you.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Primal Form.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, choose an element (air, earth, fire, or water). You assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a Medium elemental of the chosen element (MM 96-100). Primal form also grants you the elemental subtype appropriate to the chosen element. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities. There is a 25%% chance that critical hits and sneak attacks scored on you are negated, as if you were wearing armor with the light fortification special ability (DMG 219). You cannot cast spells, and you lose any spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities of your own form. You gain additional abilities depending on the element you chose when you cast the spell: Air: Fly speed 20 feet (perfect). Earth: Damage reduction 5/-. Fire: 1d4 fire damage, resistance to fire 10, burn (MM 98). Water: Swim 90 feet, drench (MM 101). Your equipment melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Prismatic Eye.MOD					DESC:You create a visible orb that can produce ray effects duplicating the beams of a prismatic spray spell (PH 264). You can move the eye up to your speed as a move action, but it cannot go beyond the spell's range. Starting in the round the eye appears, you can command it to fire a ray (50-foot range) as a free action once per round. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with a ray to strike a target, but each ray uses a +6 bonus on attack rolls instead of your ranged attack bonus. A target struck by a ray suffers the effect of one beam of a prismatic spray spell (roll 1d8 to determine the effect, rerolling any result of 8), except that the save DC (if applicable) is 19. After a particular color of ray has been used, it is no longer available to the eye, and die rolls that indicate the same color are rerolled. Once all seven rays have been fired, the eye remains until the spell's duration expires. You can still move it, but it can fire no more rays. The eye is a Fine object with AC 18 (+8 size) and 9 hit points. It uses your save bonuses for saving throws. Focus: A polished, rainbow-hued abalone shell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Prismatic Ray.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. On a successful attack, a creature with 6 Hit Dice or fewer is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the prismatic ray in addition to suffering a randomly determined effect: Color of 1d8 Beam Effect$ 1 Red 20 points fire damage (Reflex half) 2 Orange 40 points acid damage (Reflex half) 3 Yellow 80 points electricity damage (Reflex half) 4 Green Poison (Kills; Fortitude partial, take 1d6 Con damage instead) 5 Blue Turned to stone (Fortitude negates) 6 Indigo Insane, as insanity spell (Will negates) 7 Violet Sent to another plane (Will negates) 8 - Two effects; roll twice more, ignoring any "8" results|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Probe Thoughts.MOD				DESC:All of the subject's memories and knowledge are accessible to you, ranging from memories deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind. You can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject's knowledge. You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the subject do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures might yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to your questions. The subject is not aware that its mind is being probed, unless you wish to make it aware. If the subject moves beyond the range of the spell, the effect ends.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Programmed Amnesia.MOD				DESC:You can selectively destroy, alter, or implant memories in the subject creature as you see fit. Casting the spell gives you access to all of the subject's thoughts and memories, allowing you to implement as many of the following specific effects as you like. Memory Erasure: Memories possessed by the subject can be erased, including knowledge of specific events, people, or places. You can erase up to one full week of memories from the subject's mind. Memory Implant: You can create false memories in the subject's mind as you see fit. You can implant memories of being friends with a hated enemy, events that didn't really take place, or betrayals by people the subject regards as friends. Negative Levels: You can bestow a number of negative levels equal to 1/2 the subject's character level (rounding down, minimum 1st level) or less. This effect represents erasure of class knowledge and training. These negative levels never become permanent level loss, but they cannot be removed by spells such as restoration, instead returning at a rate of one level per day. Persona Rebuilding: By erasing the subject's previous personality and implanting a false set of memories, you can build a new persona for the creature, altering its alignment, beliefs, values, and personality traits. (Some class abilities might be affected by alignment changes.) Programmed Trigger: You can program the subject to delay the onset of any of the above effects until a specific event takes place, such as the receipt of a coded message, capture by enemies, or arrival at some destination. Similarly, you could specify some or all of the alterations you create in a subject to be removed by a specific event. The nature of programmed amnesia is such that a subject given new memories (whether willing or not) might be given cause to suspect that those memories are false, based on how complete your programming is. For example, a paladin subject to a persona rebuilding effect that changes her alignment to neutral loses her paladin abilities. Unless you impart a specific believable memory of why she changed alignment, the character will perceive this unexplained gap in her memory and might take steps (such as seeking a magical cure for her "amnesia") that could negate the spell's effect (see below). Generally, your subject must be either willing to undergo the spell or restrained in some way so that it cannot leave or interfere with the casting. Programmed amnesia cannot be dispelled, and so is normally permanent unless you care to specify events that will end the effect. Its effect can also be removed by a greater restoration, miracle, or wish spell. Material Component: A set of small crystal lenses set in gold loops worth 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Protection from Negative Energy.MOD		DESC:The warded creature gains partial protection against negative energy effects. For as long as the spell lasts, it subtracts 10 from the hit point damage dealt by any negative energy effect (such as an inflict spell) that adversely affects it. Negative energy effects that don't deal hit point damage to the subject, such as an energy drain spell, affect the subject normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Protection from Positive Energy.MOD		DESC:The warded creature gains partial protection against positive energy effects. For as long as the spell lasts, it subtracts 10 from the hit point damage dealt by any positive energy effect (such as a cure spell) that adversely affects it. Positive energy effects that don't deal hit point damage to the subject, such as turning attempts, affect the subject normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Protege.MOD						DESC:You briefly grant some bard abilities to a creature of your choice. The subject of the spell can then function as a bard of one-half your current bard level with respect to bardic music and bardic knowledge. However, protege imparts no spellcasting ability and does not grant access to spells not normally available to the subject. For Perform checks and bardic music prerequisites, the creature uses its own ranks in Perform or one-half of your ranks (modified by its own Charisma modifier), whichever is better.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Puppeteer.MOD					DESC:You force the subject to mimic your actions. The subject matches your motions exactly, though it takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity and Strength. Its movements look awkward, and its actions aren't as effective as if it were actually doing them itself. You can try to make the subject commit a suicidal act, but it receives another Will save to break the spell. If that save is successful, the subject collapses, helpless and in a comatose state, for 1d4 rounds. Anyone observing the subject of this spell can determine that the subject's actions are being controlled by making a DC 15 Sense Motive check (or DC 10 if the controlling bard is also visible). This spell doesn't grant the subject extraordinary, supernatural, spell-like abilities, or spellcasting abilities, even if you have and use such abilities during the spell's duration.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quick March.MOD					DESC:Quick march increases your allies' base land speed by 30 feet. (This adjustment is considered an enhancement bonus.) There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases a creature's speed, this spell affects maximum jumping distance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quick Potion.MOD					DESC:You transform the water in a flask so that it is capable of storing a spell in the manner of a potion. On your next turn, you or another spellcaster can cast a spell into the water, transforming the water into a potion of the appropriate type. Only spells suitable for making potions can be used in this way.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quill Blast.MOD					DESC:Creatures within the spread of a quill blast are hit by one or more quills, depending on their size: Tiny or smaller, 4 quills; Small, 6 quills; Medium, 8 quills; Large, 10 quills; and Huge or larger, 12 quills. Small or larger creatures that make their saves are struck by half as many quills; Tiny or smaller creatures that make their saves avoid the quills completely. Each quill deals 1d6 points of damage and lodges itself into the creature it hits. Lodged quills impose a noncumulative -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks. All quills can be removed safely as a standard action with a DC 20 Heal check. Otherwise, removing the quills deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. Material Component: A porcupine quill.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Quillfire.MOD					DESC:Your hand sprouts poisonous quills that you can use in melee or as a ranged attack. The quills deal 1d8 points of damage. They can be thrown (range increment 10 feet). The quills are poisonous (injury DC equal DC of quillfire, 1d6 Str/1d6 Str).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Radiant Assault.MOD				DESC:This spell releases energy in the form of a multitude of rainbow-colored beams that erupt in every direction within the area designated by you. This kaleidoscopic burst of energy deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), and all creatures within the burst are dazed for 1d6 rounds. Those that succeed on a Will save take only half normal damage and are dazzled for 1d6 rounds instead. Sightless creatures are unaffected by this spell. Focus: An eye from any outsider that has 4 or more Hit Dice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Raging Flame.MOD					DESC:This spell inflames existing fire, giving it a passion to burn. All normal fires within the affected area flare up, burning twice as hot and twice as bright. The illumination radii of all nonmagical fires double (so a torch casts bright illumination in a 40-foot radius), and all nonmagical fires deal double damage (so a creature that catches on fire takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round). Fire that leaves the area remains affected by the spell. Fire affected by this spell burns out twice as quickly, so a torch that is the subject of a raging flame spell burns out in 30 minutes instead of the normal hour. Magical fire in the area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, burns hotter, dealing +1 point of fire damage per die. Raging flame counters or dispels the effect of slow burn (page 192).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rainbow Beam.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If you hit, the subject is dazzled for 1 minute. The spell also deals 1d12 points of damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d12). A rainbow beam deals a random type of damage as determined by the following table. If two types of energy are indicated, rainbow beam deals half its damage from each type of energy indicated. Creatures apply energy resistance separately to each type of damage. 1d8 Color Damage Type 1 red fire 2 orange acid 3 yellow electricity 4 green poison 5 blue cold 6 indigo sonic 7 violet force 8 multihued roll twice (ignore further results of 8) Focus: A small clear gem or crystal prism worth at least 10 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rainbow Blast.MOD					DESC:This spell is a wide-spectrum blast of radiant energy composed of all five energy types. Rainbow blast deals 1d6 points of damage from each of the five energy types (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic), for a total of 5d6 points of damage. Creatures apply resistance to energy separately for each type of damage. As you gain in levels, the damage die increases in size. At 7th level the spell deals 5d8 points of damage, at 9th level it deals 5d10 points of damage, and at 11th level it deals 5d12 points of damage-one die for each of the five energy types. Focus: A small clear gem or crystal prism worth at least 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Raise from the Deep.MOD				DESC:The subject of this spell gains magical buoyancy and floats on the surface of the water for the duration of the spell, despite its weight or normal buoyancy. It cannot swim below the surface of the water. Creatures that must breathe water can still do so. If the subject is underwater at the time this spell is cast, it rises toward the surface at a speed of 150 feet. The magic of the spell prevents the subject from taking damage from the speed of the ascent. This spell is particularly effective at raising sunken ships from the deep. If you know the exact details of the shipwreck (its appearance, its name, the date of its creation, its history, and the circumstances of its sinking), the vertical distance between you and the subject is not a factor. When cast to raise a shipwreck, the spell brings up all surviving fragments of the ship, along with any loose objects that are in contact with the ship or enclosed inside it. The ship and its fragments remain on the surface of the ocean until the spell's duration ends, at which point the ship sinks again if it has not been repaired. (Multiple consecutive castings of the spell might be needed to keep the ship afloat long enough to be fully repaired.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ram's Might.MOD					DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and your unarmed attacks deal lethal instead of nonlethal damage. You are considered armed. The spell has no other effect; you can cast spells and manipulate objects normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rapid Burrowing.MOD				DESC:This spell increases the touched creature's burrow speed by 20 feet. It has no effect on other modes of movement, nor does it grant the subject a burrow speed or the ability to burrow through stone if the creature cannot already do so.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Clumsiness.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The energy of the ray stiffens the subject's muscles and joints, making it more difficult for the subject to move. The subject takes a penalty to Dexterity equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum penalty 1d6+5, minimum Dexterity 1).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Deanimation.MOD				DESC:This ray interferes with magical animation, degenerating the magic bound within constructs and effectively causing damage. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the subject (maximum 15d6).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray Deflection.MOD				DESC:For the duration of the spell, you are protected against ranged touch attacks, including ray spells and ray attacks made by creatures. Any ray attack directed at you is automatically reflected harmlessly away. Focus: A glass prism.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Dizziness.MOD				DESC:You strike out at your enemy with a ray that causes intense feelings of vertigo. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A struck subject experiences strong feelings of vertigo and can take only a move action or a standard action each round (but not both, and it cannot take a full-round action). Focus: A small top.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Entropy.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you unleash a ray of negative energy that consumes the life energy of the subject. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If your attack is successful against a living creature, the ray makes the subject weaker, slower, and less healthy. The subject takes a -4 penalty to Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Flame.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If your attack is successful, the ray deals 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). The target must also make a Reflex save or catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are put out (requiring a DC 15 Reflex save; see Catching on Fire, DMG 303). Focus: A small, polished glass lens.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Ice.MOD					DESC:You launch a ray of numbing cold at your enemy. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If successful, the ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). The target must also make a Reflex save or be frozen to the ground with its feet encased in ice. A frozen creature cannot move, receives no Dexterity bonus to AC, and incurs a -2 penalty on attack rolls. A frozen creature can free itself with a DC 18 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the ice. Material Component: Ice or a vial of melted mountain snow.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Light.MOD					DESC:You direct a short ray at the eyes of a target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. With a successful ranged touch attack, the subject is blinded for 1d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Sickness.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. If your ranged touch attack hits, the subject becomes sickened.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Stupidity.MOD				DESC:This ray clouds the mind of your enemy, damaging its intellect. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A subject struck by the ray takes 1d4+1 points of Intelligence damage. If the target is a wizard, she might temporarily lose the ability to cast some or all of her spells if her Intelligence drops too low. Material Component: A miniature cone-shaped hat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ray of Weakness.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The target of this ray feels weaker and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls. Its speed is reduced by 10 feet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Razorfangs.MOD					DESC:Choose one of your natural weapons that deals slashing or piercing damage (such as a bite or a single claw). That natural weapon's threat range doubles (in most cases, becoming 19-20). The effect of this spell does not stack with any other effects that increase a weapon's threat range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reality Maelstrom.MOD				DESC:You tear a temporary hole in reality itself that sucks all loose material and living creatures into it, sending them to a random plane (see sidebar). Everything sucked into the reality maelstrom goes to the same plane. Reality maelstrom has a primary area and a secondary area. The primary area is the hole itself: a sphere with a 20-foot radius centered on the spell's point of origin. Within that area, all unattended objects weighing 100 pounds or less are sucked into the maelstrom, as are all individuals who fail a Will saving throw. The rip also creates a windstorm of air that affects objects and creatures in the secondary area of the spell. The secondary area is all the space farther than 20 feet from the spell's point of origin but not farther than 40 feet away. All unattended objects within the secondary area that weigh 50 pounds or less are drawn into the primary area of the maelstrom. Individuals within the secondary area must make a Reflex saving throw. Those who fail are sucked into the primary area and must then make a Will saving throw to avoid being drawn into the maelstrom. Individuals who succeed on either saving throw can move and attack as normal. A reality maelstrom is a one-way portal, so nothing ever emerges from the hole the spell makes. Material Component: A golden hoop no less than 1 inch across.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reaving Dispel.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like dispel magic (PH 223), except that your caster level for your dispel check is a maximum of +20 instead of +10, and (as with greater dispel magic) you have a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. When casting a targeted dispel or counterspell, you can choose to reave each spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself. When making a targeted dispel, make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the target spell or each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target creature or object. Each spell you dispel with a targeted dispel can be reaved if you so desire, and the spell's effects are redirected to you, continuing as if cast on you by the original caster with no interruption to or extension of duration. Once you reave the spell, you identify it if you haven't done so already (see below). If the subject was the caster and the spell is dismissible, you can dismiss it as if you had cast it yourself. Likewise, if the subject was the caster and the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect as if you had cast it yourself. You can still attempt to reave a spell you didn't identify with your Spellcraft check, but doing so can be risky if you don't know the specifics of the spell's effect. For example, if you fail to identity an ongoing spell effect on an enemy character and choose to reave anyway, you might find yourself under the influence of the dominate person effect that character was suffering from. Any spell resistance you might have has no effect against harmful spells you might inadvertently reave, but you get the same chance to save against those spell effects as the original target. If you choose to reave a spell you have successfully counterspelled with reaving dispel, you seize control of the spell after the enemy caster completes it, and you can redirect the spell to whatever targets or area you wish (including the original caster, if appropriate). Again, you must make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the spell you intend to reave, but you are free to choose to redirect a spell whose effect, range, and area you don't know. If the redirected spell's correct casting conditions aren't met (because you guess at an improper target or range, for example), the spell fails. Reaving dispel can be used to cast an area dispel with the increased maximum caster level, but any magical effects so dispelled cannot be reaved.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rebuke.MOD						DESC:When the spell is cast, the subject is dazed for 1 round and shaken for the duration of the spell. Furthermore, a spellcaster targeted by rebuke must make a successful Concentration check (DC equal to the save DC for this spell + the level of the spell being cast) to cast spells while under its effect. Focus: A stick at least 1 foot long.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rebuke (Final).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like rebuke, except that the target dies instantly if it fails its saving throw. A creature that survives this effect is dazed for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rebuke (Greater).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like rebuke, except that the subject is cowering for 1d4 rounds instead of being dazed for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rebuking Breath.MOD				DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue your breath weapon with negative energy that rebukes undead in its area. Undead within the area of your breath weapon that fail their saving throws against it cower as if in awe for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reciprocal Gyre.MOD				DESC:The subject takes 1d12 points of damage per functioning spell or spell-like ability currently affecting it (maximum 25d12). In addition, any creature so affected that fails its Will save must then succeed on a Fortitude save or be dazed for 1d6 rounds. Only spells specifically targeted on the creature in question can be used to create the backlash of a reciprocal gyre, so spells that affect an area can't be used to deal reciprocal damage to creatures within their area. Likewise, persistent or continuous effects from magic items can't be used to deal reciprocal damage, but targeted spell effects can be. Material Component: A tiny closed loop of copper wire.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Recitation.MOD					DESC:The spell affects all allies within the spell's area at the moment you cast it. Your allies gain a +2 luck bonus to AC, on attack rolls, and on saving throws, or a +3 luck bonus if they worship the same deity as you. Divine Focus: In addition to your holy symbol, this spell requires a sacred text as a divine focus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Red Tide.MOD					DESC:All creatures in the area of a red tide spell are immediately knocked prone and must make a Fortitude saving throw. A creature that makes its Fortitude save against a red tide is sickened for 1 minute. A creature that fails this saving throw is nauseated for 1 minute, and it takes 2d6 points of Strength damage. After 1 minute, the nausea ends but the creature must make a second Fortitude saving throw or take an additional 2d6 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are immune to poison are immune to these effects of a red tide. Creatures with the fire subtype take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half with a successful Reflex save. The tainted water evoked by this spell vanishes almost immediately, and any objects or creatures in the area do not emerge wet.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reduce Person (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like reduce person (PH 269), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reflective Disguise.MOD				DESC:A reflective disguise spell causes any intelligent creature viewing you to perceive you as the same species and gender as itself, provided that its size category is no more than one step different from your own. The spell changes perceptions of clothing, race, and gender. Reflective disguise does not give you any knowledge of the abilities or mannerisms of the reflected form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch), audible (sound), or olfactory (smell) properties of you or your equipment. A creature that interacts with the glamer, beyond simply viewing it, gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion. For example, a creature that touched you and realized that the tactile sensation did not match the visual one would be entitled to such a save. A creature with the scent ability automatically gets a Will save if you are within its scent range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reflective Disguise (Mass).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like reflective disguise, except you can change the appearance of other creatures as well. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. An unwilling target can negate the spell's effect on itself by making a successful Will save or with spell resistance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Refusal.MOD						DESC:You create a special ward that prevents unauthorized spellcasters or creatures with spell-like abilities from entering an area. Any creature that has spells prepared, spell slots available for casting without preparation, or innate spell-like abilities must succeed on a Will save or be halted by an invisible barrier that prevents passage. The DC of the Will save increases by a number equal to the spell level of the highestlevel spell the creature has prepared or is capable of casting (so that a 10th-level sorcerer who hasn't yet depleted his 5thlevel spell slots for the day adds 5 to the save DC). You can choose to designate a password or special condition (such as character race, alignment, possession of a token, or any other observable or detectable characteristic) by which spellcasting characters and creatures can enter the refusal-warded area. Creatures that have no spellcasting capability or spell-like abilities (including spellcasters who have used up their spell slots and creatures with spell trigger or spell completion magic items) can pass through the barrier with no difficulty. Spellcasters and creatures that have spell-like abilities and that are already within the area you protect when you create the ward are not compelled to leave or restricted in their movement within it (and spells and spell-like abilities can pass through the barrier in either direction with no difficulty). However, if such creatures leave the area, they must succeed on saving throws as described above to return. Creatures attempting to use any teleportation spell or effect to enter the warded area make the normal saving throw. They are shunted harmlessly to the nearest safe space outside the warded area if they fail. Material Component: A pinch of dust from a wizard's tomb.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Regal Procession.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like mount (PH 256), except you can summon several mounts. Each comes with a bit and bridle, riding saddle, saddle blanket, ribbons, adornments, and a banner. You select the colors of the horses and the livery, either or both of which can include a heraldic or personal symbol.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rejection.MOD					DESC:A creature in the area must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or be pushed away from you to a distance of 5 feet per caster level. If the creature is pushed into a wall or similarly solid surface, it takes 1d6 points of damage for every 10 feet it was moved. Movement forced by this spell can take the creature beyond the spell's range.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rejuventation Cocoon.MOD			DESC:When you cast the spell, the rejuvenation cocoon forms around the subject. One round after the cocoon forms, it heals the subject of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 hit points) and purges the subject of poison and disease. At the end of the second round, the rejuvenation cocoon dissipates and the subject emerges, able to move and act freely. The cocoon is made of force, but it is somewhat flexible and responds to pressure from the inside of the cocoon. The subject can't move from the space it is in while cocooned, however. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 10 hit points per caster level. If it is destroyed, the spell ends. Material Component: A cocoon of a butterfly.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rejuvenative Corpse.MOD				DESC:You charge a dead body with negative energy, giving it the ability to heal an undead creature that dines upon its flesh. The corpse remains charged with this energy for up to 24 hours. If an undead creature eats a full meal of the corpse's flesh within this time (a humanlike undead creature, such as a ghoul, generally taking 10 minutes), the undead gains fast healing 1 upon completing its feast, which lasts for the next 5 minutes. This effect does not stack with any fast healing the undead has from other sources. This spell does not allow the undead to regrow or attach lost body parts. Eating the flesh discharges the spell from the corpse. You can cast this spell multiple times on a corpse, allowing more than one undead to benefit from eating it, though a single undead gorging itself on multiple "meals" does not gain any extra benefit while the first meal is in effect (the fast healing does not stack). A typical Medium corpse is usually enough for ten such meals, a Small corpse five, Tiny two, and Diminutive one. A living creature that eats a charged corpse must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or immediately contract filth fever (DMG 292; no incubation time). Creatures that are neither alive nor undead and eat the charged corpse are unaffected.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Remove Scent.MOD					DESC:This spells hides the scent of the creature or object touched for the duration of the spell. The scent ability (MM 314) cannot detect a creature under the effect of a remove scent spell. It also negates the harmful effects of the noxious stench exuded by certain creatures, such as ghasts, for the duration of the spell. Material Component: A pinch of unscented candle wax.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Renewal Pact.MOD					DESC:This spell remains dormant until the subject is subjected to one or more of the following adverse conditions: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, or poisoned. One round after the subject is affected by a condition that triggers the renewal pact, the subject receives a panacea spell (page 152) at a caster level equal to that of the caster of the renewal pact. A creature can be subject to only one renewal pact at a time. Casting renewal pact on a subject who already has an untriggered renewal pact voids the earlier pact. Material Component: A topaz worth at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Repair Critical Damage.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like repair light damage, except that you repair 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Repair Light Damage.MOD				DESC:When laying your hand upon a construct that has at least 1 hit point remaining, you transmute its structure to repair the damage it has taken. The spell repairs 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Repair Minor Damage.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like repair light damage, except that you repair 1 point of damage to a construct.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Repair Moderate Damage.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like repair light damage, except that you repair 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) to a construct.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Repair Serious Damage.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like repair light damage, except that you repair 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15) to a construct.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Replicate Casting.MOD				DESC:You duplicate the effect of any one spell or spell-like ability you have seen within the last round. This spell can duplicate only spells and spell-like abilities of 8th level or lower. This duplication functions like the ability of a wish spell to duplicate another spell, except that it is not limited by type of spell (divine or arcane) or by what school the effect is from. If the casting time of the spell you observed is greater than 1 round, the casting time of this spell is increased to the same. A duplicated spell or spell-like ability functions as if you had the appropriate spell prepared and were casting it yourself. If the spell or ability has an XP cost, you must pay that XP cost. If the spell has a costly material component, you must provide that component or pay an additional XP cost equal to the gold piece value of that component divided by 5.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resist Energy (Mass).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like resist energy (PH 272), except that it affects all targeted creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resist Planar Alignment.MOD			DESC:This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from a plane's alignment traits (DMG 149). When the subject visits a plane with an alignment trait, this spell grants it immunity to penalties on its Charisma-based checks that mildly aligned planes impose on visitors of opposed alignments. The Charisma-, Wisdom-, and Intelligencebased check penalties associated with strongly aligned planes are halved while the spell's duration lasts.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resistance (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like resistance (PH 272), except as noted here. You grant the subject a +3 resistance bonus on saves.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resistance (Superior).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like resistance (PH 272), except as noted here. You grant the subject a +6 resistance bonus on saves.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resonating Bolt.MOD				DESC:The bolt of sonic energy deals 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to each creature within its area. In addition, a resonating bolt deals full damage to objects and can easily shatter or break interposing barriers. If the bolt destroys a barrier, it can continue beyond the barrier if its range permits; otherwise, it stops.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Restoration (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like restoration (PH 272), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resurgence.MOD					DESC:The subject of a resurgence spell can make a second attempt to save against an ongoing spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, such as dominate person. If the subject of resurgence is affected by more than one ongoing magical effect, the subject chooses one of them to retry the save against. If the subject succeeds on the saving throw on the second attempt, the effect ends immediately. Resurgence never restores hit points or ability score damage, but it does eliminate any conditions such as shaken, fatigued, or nauseated that were caused by a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. If a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability doesn't allow a save (such as power word stun), then resurgence won't help the subject recover.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resurgence (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like resurgence, except as noted here. The spell grants a second save attempt against a single spell or ability chosen by you. For instance, if three of your allies have been mind blasted by mind flayers and two others have been turned into toads by baleful polymorph spells, you must choose to affect either the mind blast (granting three new save attempts) or the baleful polymorphs (granting two new save attempts).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reveille.MOD					DESC:You cause a creature that has been dead for up to three days to reveal information about events that led up to its death. The corpse speaks tersely in its native language, using no more than a dozen words or so in a round. In the first round, it describes the last thing it saw. In the second, it describes its dying wish. In the third, it describes the attack that killed it. In the fourth, it tells who killed it. In the fifth, it tells why it believes it was killed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Revenance.MOD					DESC:This spell brings a dead ally temporarily back to life. The subject can have been dead for up to 1 round per level. Your target functions as if a raise dead spell (PH 268) had been cast upon her, except that she does not lose a level and has half of her full normal hit points. She is alive (not undead) for the duration of the spell and can be healed normally, but dies as soon as the spell ends. While under the effect of this spell, the subject is not affected by spells that raise the dead. The subject gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, saves, and checks against the creature that killed her.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Reverse Arrows.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like protection from arrows (PH 266), except as noted here. If any projectile fired from a ranged weapon that strikes you has all its damage negated by your damage reduction (10/magic), the projectile is turned back upon the creature that fired it. The attacker's attack roll is used to determine if the reversed projectile strikes the attacker, but the damage is rerolled. If the attacker is also protected by a reverse arrows spell, it is possible for the projectile to bounce between both individuals until one of the spells is discharged from accumulated damage. Once this spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged. Focus: A piece of shell from a tortoise and a ball of tree sap.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Revive Outsider.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like protection from arrows (PH 266), except as noted here. If any projectile fired from a ranged weapon that strikes you has all its damage negated by your damage reduction (10/magic), the projectile is turned back upon the creature that fired it. The attacker's attack roll is used to determine if the reversed projectile strikes the attacker, but the damage is rerolled. If the attacker is also protected by a reverse arrows spell, it is possible for the projectile to bounce between both individuals until one of the spells is discharged from accumulated damage. Once this spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged. Focus: A piece of shell from a tortoise and a ball of tree sap.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Revive Undead.MOD					DESC:Your restore animation to an undead creature destroyed by hit point loss (even a zombie or skeleton, which can't normally be reanimated once destroyed). You can revive a destroyed undead creature that has been inactive for up to one day per caster level. In addition, the subject's animating spirit must be free and willing to return. If the subject's animating spirit is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects that want to revive receive no saving throw. Revive undead restores hit points to the subject up to a total of 1 hit point per Hit Die. The body of the undead to be revived must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is reanimated. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell. An undead that has been destroyed by a turning effect can't be revived by this spell. The subject of the spell loses one level or Hit Die (if it doesn't have a character class level, it loses a HD) when it is revived. This level loss cannot be repaired by any spell. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Charisma instead. An undead that was destroyed with spells prepared has a 50%% chance of losing any given spell upon being revived, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting undead creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50%% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level. Material Component: A black pearl worth at least 5,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Revivify.MOD					DESC:Revivify miraculously restores life to a recently deceased creature. However, the spell must be cast within 1 round of the victim's death. Before the soul of the deceased has completely left the body, this spell halts its journey while repairing somewhat the damage to the body. This spell functions like raise dead (PH 268), except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no Constitution loss, and no loss of spells. The creature has -1 hit points (but is stable). Material Component: Diamonds worth at least 1,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rhino's Rush.MOD					DESC:This spell allows you to propel yourself in a single deadly charge. The first charge attack you make before the end of the round deals double damage on a successful hit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Righteous Aura.MOD				DESC:You are bathed in an unearthly glow for the duration of the spell, as if a daylight spell (PH 216) had been cast on you. You get a +4 sacred bonus to Charisma. If you die, your body is converted into an explosive blast of energy in a 20-foot-radius burst centered where you fell, dealing 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all evil creatures in the burst's area. Good creatures in the area are healed by the same amount, and undead take double this damage. Spell resistance cannot prevent this damage, but a successful Reflex save reduces it to half. Your body is disintegrated, so you cannot be raised with a raise dead spell. Spells that do not require an intact body, such as true resurrection, can be used to bring you back to life as normal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Righteous Fury.MOD				DESC:Summoning the power of your deity, you charge yourself with positive energy. This gives you 5 temporary hit points per caster level (maximum 50) and a +4 sacred bonus to Strength. These temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Righteous Wrath of the Faithful.MOD		DESC:Allies gain one additional melee attack each round, at their highest attack bonus, when making a full attack. (This additional attack is not cumulative with other effects that grant extra attacks, such as a haste spell.) They also gain a +3 morale bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls. (This bonus on melee attack rolls does stack with the bonus provided by haste.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ring of Blades.MOD				DESC:This spell conjures a horizontal ring of swirling metal blades around you. The ring extends 5 feet from you, into all squares adjacent to your space, and it moves with you as you move. Each round, at the beginning of your turn, and also when you cast the spell, the blades deal 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) to all creatures in the affected area. Spell resistance does not apply to the damage dealt, but a creature's damage reduction does apply. The blades are treated as magic, silvered, and slashing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Material Component: A small dagger.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ruby Ray of Reversal.MOD			DESC:Each version of this spell can target one of the hazards described below and "correct" it in the manner described. Unless specifically stated otherwise, this spell affects magical and mundane hazards of the indicated type equally. For example, a ruby ray of reversal can eliminate the webs of a monstrous spider or the effect of a web spell. . Any trap targeted by the ray is sprung. This version of the spell can have adverse effects on creatures standing within a trap's area. You must be aware of a trap to cast ruby ray of reversal on it. . The spell unties knots and causes chains, manacles, and similar restraining devices to fall away. Entangle and similar magical effects are dispelled. Doors (or chests, drawers, cabinets, and so on) that are locked, barred, or under the effect of an arcane lock spell are opened. . A 5-foot-diameter hole is created in a wall of force, forcecage, or similar spell or effect. This function of the spell does not destroy the targeted effect, but creatures trapped by it might be able to wriggle free. . A creature that has been polymorphed, turned to stone, or otherwise transformed from its natural state is returned to its natural form. . A magic jar spell is dispelled if a ruby ray of reversal targets the crystal holding the caster's soul. . Webs, slime, grease, and other substances that would hamper movement are destroyed in a 20-foot-radius spread. Focus: A ruby worth at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Ruin Delver's Fortune.MOD			DESC:When the spell is cast, choose from one of the following effects. . Gain a luck bonus on Fortitude saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier, and immunity to poison. . Gain a luck bonus on Reflex saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier, and the evasion ability. . Gain a luck bonus on Will saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier, and immunity to fear effects. . Gain temporary hit points equal to 4d8 + your Cha modifier. These hit points vanish at the end of the spell's duration. You can cast this spell multiple times. Each time you do, choose a different benefit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rushing Waters.MOD				DESC:Cold water gushes in a great wave outward from the point you choose, violently spreading to the limits of the area. This wave makes a bull rush attempt against each creature in the affected area without provoking attacks of opportunity. The wave has a +15 bonus on the opposed Strength check. If the wave wins the opposed Strength check, the defender is moved 5 feet directly away from the spell's point of origin, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the wave's check result exceeds that of the defender. Any creature moved 5 or more feet by rushing waters must succeed on a Reflex save or fall prone. The wave also drenches anything in its area and extinguishes any normal fire as large as a bonfire.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rust Ray.MOD					DESC:This russet ray corrodes metal that it touches. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. It can effectively destroy any nonmagical iron or iron alloy object. Such objects struck by a rust ray take 2d6 points of damage +1 per two caster levels (maximum +10), ignoring hardness. You can also target a weapon being wielded or metal armor being worn. Metal armor affected by this ray takes normal damage from the spell and loses 1d4 points of Armor Class through corrosion. If an item is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. Ferrous creatures struck by the ray take the same damage as objects. Magic items can negate the effect with a successful Fortitude saving throw. Material Component: Rust particles or a piece of a rust monster.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sacred Haven.MOD					DESC:You and affected allies gain a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class. In addition, while protected by this spell, an affected creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class when flat-footed or when struck by an invisible attacker. For the duration of the spell, you gain awareness of the health of all affected creatures, as with the status spell (PH 284), and you need not be able to touch the affected creatures to heal them with your lay on hands ability. Use of the lay on hands ability still requires a standard action, but it can be done at any range, as long as you and your target are on the same plane.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Safe Clearing.MOD					DESC:You make an area safe from attacks. This spell's benefit functions much like that of the sanctuary spell (PH 274). The area of a safe clearing spell is immobile. Any creature attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack anyone within the safe clearing, or any creature attempting to enter the area, must make a Will save. Success means the creature can act normally and is not affected by this casting of the spell. Failure means it can't attack anyone in the area or even enter the area for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack creatures in the warded area remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent creatures in the warded area from being attacked or affected by area spells. A creature within the area that makes an attack is no longer protected by the spell, and can be targeted normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Safety.MOD						DESC:The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct direction to a place of safety, with safety being defined as a location where the individual is not taking immediate damage from the environment, and immediate damage is not imminent. It does not provide the means for the subject to move in that direction. A safety spell points out the shortest distance out of a poisonous cloud, or the direction one should dig to reach the surface if entombed in earth. It does not function against the maze spell, because that spell deals no physical damage. Nor does the spell provide knowledge of or protection against the creatures that inhabit those safe places. In the D&amp;D cosmology (DMG 150), safety has the following effects when cast on specific planes. Plane of Shadow: Shortest route out of darklands. Elemental Plane of Air: Nearest windproof shelter, shortest route out of smoke bank. Elemental Plane of Earth: Nearest air pocket or open cavern. Elemental Plane of Fire: Shortest route out of magma pools or other unusually hot places. Elemental Plane of Water: Nearest pocket of breathable air; shortest route out of hot spot, ice pocket, or red tide. Negative Energy Plane: Nearest doldrum area with the minor negative- dominant trait. Positive Energy Plane: Nearest edge zone with the minor positive-dominant trait. Limbo: Nearest area of stabilized limbo. Pandemonium: Nearest shelter from a windstorm. Carceri: Shortest route out of a Minethys sandstorm. Gehenna: Nearest flat ledge, nearest shelter from Mungoth's acidic snow. Nine Hells: Nearest shelter from fireballs on Avernus, rockslides on Malbolge, or cold on Cania. Acheron: Nearest shelter from Ocanthus bladestorms. On planes you create yourself, safety might provide other information. This spell is mostly used in hostile environments, such as one of the Inner Planes, to locate the nearest pocket of habitable space. If safety is cast and then followed by a plane shift spell (PH 262), the plane shift sends the subject of safety to a place of relative safety on that plane. It is transported to a pocket of air on the Elemental Plane of Water, for example, or a cool spot on the Elemental Plane of Fire.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Saltray.MOD						DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A creature struck by a saltray takes 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) and must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sanctuary (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like sanctuary (PH 274), except that it affects multiple creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sandblast.MOD					DESC:Creatures in the area take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Any creature that fails its Reflex save is also stunned for 1 round. You are not harmed by the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sarcophagus of Stone.MOD			DESC:This spell creates an airtight stone coffin that forms around the target. The stone is 1 inch thick, has hardness 8, and requires 15 points of damage to break through. Decreasing its size does not change the thickness of the walls; the coffin is always just large enough to hold the subject. This coffin is sealed upon formation and completely impervious to air and gas. A creature trapped within a sarcophagus of stone has 1 hour worth of air, and after that time must hold its breath or begin to suffocate (DMG 304). A creature that has no need to breathe (such as a construct, elemental, or undead) needs not fear suffocation, but it remains trapped within the sarcophagus until it breaks free or is freed. A creature within the coffin can attack the stone with a natural weapon or light melee weapon. A creature can attempt a DC 26 Strength check to break free of the stone, and allies can also help to break the trapped creature free. Material Component: A fragment of a sarcophagus.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scale Weakening.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The subject's natural armor bonus is reduced by 1 point per three caster levels (maximum reduction 5 points at 15th level). This spell can't reduce a creature's natural armor bonus to less than 0, nor does it have any effect on an enhancement bonus to natural armor (such as that granted by the barkskin spell). Material Component: A shed snakeskin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scatterspray.MOD					DESC:You can point to a collection of little, unsecured items and cause them to fly off in all directions simultaneously. The spray of items creates a burst with a 10-foot radius. If the items are fairly hard or sharp (such as stones, sling bullets, coins, or the like), creatures in the burst take 1d8 points of damage. A successful Reflex save negates this damage. Eggs, fruit, and other soft objects can be used, but the damage then dealt is nonlethal damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scent.MOD						DESC:You give the creature touched the scent ability (MM 314). Material Component: A sprinkle of mustard and pepper.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scintillating Scales.MOD			DESC:This spell transforms your natural armor bonus to Armor Class into a deflection bonus to your Armor Class. While your overall Armor Class might not change, the deflection bonus applies to melee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks, including incorporeal touch attacks. If you have no natural armor bonus, this spell has no effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scintillating Sphere.MOD			DESC:A scintillating sphere is a massive electrical discharge that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature and unattended object within the area. Material Component: A glass marble.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scorch.MOD						DESC:Scorch deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels, to a maximum of 5d8 points of damage, to each target it hits. Focus: A red dragon's scale.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scourge.MOD						DESC:The target creatures are infected with a vile disease unless they succeed on a Fortitude save. Once it has infected a creature, the disease immediately deals 1d6 points of Strength and Dexterity damage, and it deals the same damage each subsequent day. A creature is allowed an additional saving throw each day to avoid that day's damage. As with mummy rot (DMG 292), successful saves do not allow the creature to recover. The symptoms persist until the creature finds some magical means to remove the disease. The disease can be removed by first casting break enchantment or remove curse on the subject (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), after which a remove disease, heal, or similar spell will cure the victim. Focus: A black whip or riding crop, which is cracked in the direction of the intended victims during the casting of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Scramble Portal.MOD				DESC:You randomize the destination of one interplanar gate or portal for the duration of the spell. Anyone who passes through the portal from either side is sent to a random plane instead of the portal's normal destination. Material Component: A cracked mirror.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Seal Portal.MOD					DESC:You can permanently seal an interplanar gate or portal. The spell prevents any use of the portal, although seal portal can be dispelled by a dispel magic spell. A knock spell does not function on a sealed portal, but a chime of opening dispels seal portal if seal portal was cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level. Once a portal is opened, seal portal does not remain in effect and must be cast again. Material Component: A silver bar worth 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Second Wind.MOD					DESC:This spell removes fatigue from a subject and provides a +4 bonus on Constitution checks for the duration of the spell. If the subject creature is exhausted when you cast this spell, its condition is improved to fatigued.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Seek Eternal Rest.MOD				DESC:You improve your ability to turn undead. For the purpose of turning or destroying undead, you are treated as a cleric of your paladin level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sense Heretic.MOD					DESC:This spell is usually cast on a weapon or a holy symbol. If an evil creature that has the ability to cast divine spells comes within 100 feet of the item, the item begins to glow with a faint blue radiance. You cannot tell where, or in which direction, the detected creature is, only that such a creature is within range. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sensory Deprivation.MOD				DESC:Rather than creating an illusion of something, this spell creates an illusion of absolute nothingness. The spell effect surrounds the subject in a dark, clinging shadow that only it perceives, which blocks all auditory, olfactory, taste, and visual sensations. In addition, it blocks finely tuned senses of touch such as those that provide a creature with tremorsense. A subject that fails its save is blinded and deafened, and it gains no benefit from blindsense, blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. The subject retains any telepathic or empathic links it might possess with other creatures while affected by the spell. Material Component: Black silk cloth tied like a blindfold.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Serence Visage.MOD				DESC:Simple illusions aid your attempts to be persuasive. You gain an insight bonus equal to one-half your caster level (maximum +10) on Bluff checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Servant Horde.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a number of unseen servants (PH 297) equal to 2d6 +1 per level (maximum +15). Material Component: A small stick to which many lengths of knotted thread are attached.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Binding.MOD				DESC:Creatures in the area that fail a Will save are entangled and unable to move. Breaking free of a shadow binding requires a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check, taken as a full-round action. Material Component: A few links of iron chain.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Cache.MOD					DESC:You can temporarily stash small items on the Plane of Shadow (DMG 152) or permanently dispose of them there. This spell opens a small portal to the Plane of Shadow that is invisible on the Material Plane and appears as a small disk on the Plane of Shadow. You can reach into the Plane of Shadow through the portal created by shadow cache, but only small, nonliving objects can pass entirely through the hole. The cache can hold up to 30 cubic feet of material, or 250 pounds. You can recover objects placed in the portal throughout the duration of the spell, or by casting another shadow cache later. A shadow cache remains stationary at the point where you create it. Items placed in a shadow cache can possibly be picked up by natives of the Plane of Shadow, and in any event are slowly moved by the morphic trait of the plane. For every 24 hours that passes, there is a 10%% chance each day that objects placed on the Plane of Shadow with shadow cache are gone (either moved or taken). The spell cannot be cast on the Plane of Shadow itself, but only on planes coexistent with the Plane of Shadow.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Form.MOD					DESC:While this spell is in effect, you gain a number of benefits. The shadows wrapping your form grant you a +4 competence bonus on Escape Artist, Hide, and Move Silently checks. Your shadowy form also provides you with concealment. This shadowy concealment is not negated by a see invisibility spell, but a true seeing spell counteracts the effect. Standing within the radius of a daylight spell or in bright natural sunlight temporarily suppresses the concealment effect. In addition, if you have 5 ranks in Escape Artist, you can attempt to slip through a solid object or barrier up to 5 feet thick with a DC 20 Escape Artist check, though doing this ends the spell as soon as the attempt is completed (regardless of success). If you have 10 ranks in Escape Artist, you can attempt to pass through an object or barrier up to 10 feet thick. If you have 15 ranks in Escape Artist, you can attempt to pass through a barrier composed of magical force (or similar magical obstacles). Material Component: A small piece of black cloth taken from a funeral shroud.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Hand.MOD					DESC:You create a floating Medium hand made of shadow material. A shadow hand is an opaque gray color, 5 feet long, and 5 feet wide with its fingers outstretched. It can grant total concealment against a single opponent you designate, carry materials as Tenser's floating disk (PH 294), or point or gesture as a normal hand does. The hand has an AC of 18 (+6 natural, +2 deflection) and has half as many hit points as your full normal total. It can be damaged just as Bigby's interposing hand (PH 204) can be, and it makes all saving throws as if it were you. Changing the hand's task or target is a standard action, and it can move anywhere in range. If not given any You create a floating Medium hand made of shadow material. A shadow hand is an opaque gray color, 5 feet long, and 5 feet wide with its fingers outstretched. It can grant total concealment against a single opponent you designate, carry materials as Tenser's floating disk (PH 294), or point or gesture as a normal hand does. The hand has an AC of 18 (+6 natural, +2 deflection) and has half as many hit points as your full normal total. It can be damaged just as Bigby's interposing hand (PH 204) can be, and it makes all saving throws as if it were you. Changing the hand's task or target is a standard action, and it can move anywhere in range. If not given any|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Landscape.MOD				DESC:The spell's exact effects vary with the terrain upon which it is cast. Desert: The spell transforms a desert into a place where no one goes willingly. The average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra (see Cold Dangers and Heat Dangers, DMG 302-303). Sandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a shadow landscape desert on an hourly basis. Forest: Forests augmented with a shadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted. Spaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth instead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC). Hill: Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effect of a shadow landscape spell. Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope. Cliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to ascend or descend. Marsh: Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding. Half the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand (DMG 88). Mountain: The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds. Cliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale. Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud noises have a 10%% chance of starting an avalanche (DMG 90). Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet. Plain: Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent. Half the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell (PH 227) had been cast on them (save DC equal to the shadow landscape's DC). Underground: Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are. Natural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter. Stalagmites cover 10%% of the available floor space. In addition to terrain-specific effects, a shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell's area. When rolling random weather (DMG 94), roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result. This effect does not apply underground. You don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you created. When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather. You can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Phase.MOD					DESC:The spell temporarily transposes some of the subject's tissue with shadow-stuff, making the subject partially incorporeal. This partially incorporeal state does not allow the subject to pass through walls or other solid objects. Nonmagical physical attacks directed against the spell's subject suffer a 50%% miss chance. Magical attacks, such as supernatural and spell-like abilities, spells, and magic weapons, suffer a 20%% miss chance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Mask.MOD					DESC:You cause a mask of shadows to form around your face. It does not impede your vision, cannot be physically removed, completely hides your features, and protects you against certain attacks. You receive a +4 bonus on saving throws against light or darkness spells and any spells that rely on bright light for damaging effects, such as the flare spell or the fireworks effect of pyrotechnics. You also gain a 50%% chance each round to avoid having to make a saving throw against gaze attacks, just as if you averted your eyes. If you avert your eyes while using shadow mask, you get to check twice to see if you avoid having to make the saving throw. When the spell's duration ends, the shadow mask fades over the course of 1d4 rounds (rather than immediately), giving you time to keep your face hidden by other means. A successful dispel magic cast against a shadow mask effectively ends the spell and causes the same slow fading. Material Component: A mask of black cloth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Radiance.MOD				DESC:This spell creates an intensifying illusion of bright light that affects all creatures within the area (except those that are sightless or blinded). Viewers that fail their saving throws see a burst of bright light on the first round and become blinded for 1 round. On subsequent rounds for the rest of the spell's duration, the affected creatures continue to perceive a bright light. If they take penalties in bright illumination, they take them for the duration of their exposure to this light. Additionally, they are dazzled while in the area of the spell. Those who escape the area of a shadow radiance spell completely recover within 1 round. Those who make their saves and those outside the initial burst see only the equivalent of torchlight emanating from the center of the area. Material Component: A flame at least the size of a torch.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Spray.MOD					DESC:You cause a multitude of ribbonlike shadows to instantaneously explode outward from the point of origin. Creatures in the area take 4 points of Strength damage and are dazed for 1 round. Material Component: A handful of black ribbons.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Well.MOD					DESC:You cause the target's shadow to become a temporary gateway to a pocket realm within the Plane of Shadow. The target must make a Will save or be pulled into the gateway. Inside the pocket realm, the creature sees a deserted, gloomy duplicate of the real world, while shadowy phantasms stalk and taunt it without causing actual harm. Each round, the creature can attempt another Will save to return from the shadow well. Otherwise, the subject returns to the real world when the spell's duration expires. Being trapped in a shadow well can be terrifying; upon returning to the real world, the subject must succeed on another Will save or be frightened for 1d4 rounds. Upon leaving the pocket realm, the subject reappears in the spot it had been in when the shadow well spell was cast. If this spot is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest adjacent empty space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a shadow well spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to flee to another plane as normal. The target might still become frightened upon leaving.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadowblast.MOD					DESC:Natives of the Plane of Shadow caught in a shadowblast are stunned for 1d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw. Shadow natives that are also undead or vulnerable to light take an additional 2d10 points of damage if they fail a second Fortitude save. Creatures that fail either Fortitude save cannot use spell-like or supernatural abilities to open any portal to the Plane of Shadow for 3d6 minutes. Shadowblast closes all portals, gates, and other openings to the Plane of Shadow in its area. Creatures on the other side of a portal are unaffected by shadowblast. Material Component: A handful of grave dirt, squeezed tightly and flung.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadowfade.MOD					DESC:You open a 10-foot-diameter portal onto the Plane of Shadow, allowing you and creatures you designate within range to pass into that area. This does not grant you the ability to open another such portal automatically, so the spell is often used as a temporary hiding place or a method of gaining access to the Plane of Shadow. The portal remains for the duration of the spell, and other creatures can pass through it in either direction if they make a Will save. The portal is invisible from the Material Plane and looks like a white hole on the Plane of Shadow. You must be in a region of heavy shadows to cast shadowfade. The spell can be cast only on a plane coexistent with the Plane of Shadow (DMG 152), and it cannot be cast on the Plane of Shadow itself.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shadow Grappler.MOD				DESC:Upon casting this spell, you create a shadowy force that automatically grabs the target (PH 156). The shadowy force immediately attempts to establish a hold on the target with a grapple check bonus equal to the DC of this spell. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the grapple check bonus of the shadowy grappler is cut in half. For example, a sorcerer with a 16 Charisma who casts this spell creates a shadowy grappler with a grapple check bonus of +19 if the target fails its save and +9 if the target makes its save. Every round on your turn, the shadowy grappler makes a grapple check against the target. Once it has a hold, the shadowy force attempts to pin the target on the following round. If the grappler establishes a pin, it uses the option to prevent the target from speaking. The grappler always attempts to maintain a grapple or work toward a pin. A shadowy grappler occupies the same square as the target and moves with the target for as long as the spell lasts. Other creatures cannot join the grapple, either to assist the target or the grappler. Material Component: A dried squid tentacle.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shard Storm.MOD					DESC:Immediately upon completion of this spell, and once per round thereafter, you can cause minuscule shards of magical force to explode out in a 20- foot-radius burst from the point of origin. The storm deals 3d6 points of force damage to all creatures within the radius. A successful Reflex save halves the damage. Each round at the beginning of your turn, creatures in the area take an additional 3d6 points of force damage. You can use a free action to suppress the storm for that round. Material Component: A small shard of clear glass or crystal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Share Husk.MOD					DESC:You sense through an animal's senses, seeing through its eyes and hearing through its ears. While doing so, you use either your Listen or Spot modifiers or the animal's, whichever is better. This spell gives you no special ability to understand what you sense. You can switch your perceptions between the animal's and your own on your turn as a free action. You and the animal must be on the same plane for the spell to function. Material Component: An edible treat that would appeal to the animal (vegetable or meat).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sharptooth.MOD					DESC:Choose one of your natural weapons (or your unarmed strike if you have no natural weapons). For the duration of the spell, that method of attack deals damage as though you were one size category larger than your actual size. This spell does not stack with itself.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shatterfloor.MOD					DESC:Creatures and objects in the area take 1d4 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d4), and can make a saving throw to take half damage. If the floor of the area is made of stone, wood, ice, or material with hardness less than those, the floor is pulverized, resulting in an area of difficult terrain composed of soft dust, wood fragments, or loose crushed ice, as appropriate. Focus: A miniature hammer and bell worth at least 10 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sheltered Vitality.MOD				DESC:The subject gains immunity to fatigue, exhaustion, and ability damage or ability drain (regardless of the source).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shield of Faith (Mass).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like shield of faith (PH 278), except that it affects multiple allies at a distance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shield of Warding.MOD				DESC:The touched shield or buckler grants its wielder a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves, +1 per five caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). The bonus applies only when the shield is worn or carried normally (but not, for instance, if it is slung over the shoulder).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shieldbearer.MOD					DESC:A shieldbearer spell allows you to enchant one shield so that it hovers near and attempts to protect one creature of your choice. The spell's recipient is chosen at the time of casting and cannot be changed. The enchanted shield remains within 1 foot of the creature for the duration of the spell. The shield's subject is then granted a shield bonus to AC as if it was wearing the shield. The spell permits the enchanted shield's subject to use a two-handed weapon or a weapon in each hand and still benefit from the shield's effect. Shield bonuses from multiple sources, including multiple castings of this spell, do not stack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shifting Paths.MOD				DESC:This spell simultaneously hides a path or road specified by you, while simultaneously creating an illusory path. The illusory path starts at a point chosen by you within the range of the spell. It continues in the direction you indicate, to the limit of the spell's area, where it ends abruptly. The illusory path avoids obstacles and provides no bridges, stairs, ladders, ramps, or other methods of traversing such obstacles. There is no way to force the illusory path to lead over a cliff or across a river more than 4 feet deep. Those who fail their Will saves struggle along the illusory path. If vegetation or rough terrain slows their progress, they believe the path is sloping enough to justify the reduced speed. Those who succeed on their Will saves see both paths, but the illusory path is shadowy and obviously unreal.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shock and Awe.MOD					DESC:This spell distracts its targets, preventing them from reacting with the deftness they might otherwise possess. Only effective when cast in the surprise round of combat and against flat-footed creatures, this spell causes those it affects to take a -10 penalty on their next initiative check. Targets that cannot be caught flat-footed (such as a rogue with uncanny dodge) cannot be affected by this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shroud of Flame.MOD				DESC:This spell causes a creature to take 2d6 points of fire damage in each round of the spell's duration. The shroud of flame around the creature sheds bright illumination out to 40 feet and negates any concealment the creature might have. Immersing the subject creature in a nonflammable liquid ends the spell. Material Component: A pinch of saltpeter, a small piece of phosphorus, and a scrap of lace cloth or a spiderweb.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Shroud of Undeath.MOD				DESC:You shroud yourself with invisible negative energy so that nonintelligent undead creatures perceive you as a fellow undead, ignoring you. Your appearance does not change, and while intelligent undead do not immediately recognize you as alive, they are likely to question whether you are actually undead. If used in conjunction with a disguise or illusion to appear undead, this spell gives you a +5 bonus on your Disguise check. When you are affected by this spell, inflict spells heal you and cure spells hurt you. You are treated as if you were undead for the purpose of all spells and effects that specifically affect undead creatures. A successful turning or rebuking attempt against you (treating you as an undead of your Hit Dice) ends this spell but does not otherwise affect you. If you attack an undead creature while this spell is in effect, the spell immediately ends. Material Component: Dust or bone fragments from any destroyed undead creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sign.MOD						DESC:You get a +4 bonus on your next initiative check. Material Component: A small piece of dried goat intestine or some tea leaves.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sign of Sealing.MOD				DESC:You seal a door, chest, or similar closure with a prominent magical sigil that bars entry and prevents opening. A door or object protected by this spell can be opened only by breaking (add 10 to the normal break DC) or by the use of knock or dispel magic. If the door or object is forced open by any means (magical or physical), the sign of sealing deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) in a 30-foot radius (Reflex half). A knock spell doesn't negate or automatically bypass a sign of sealing, but will suppress the sign for 10 minutes on a successful caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the sign's creator). A sign of sealing is a magic trap that can be disarmed with a DC 28 Disable Device check. You can pass your own sign safely, and it remains set behind you. Material Component: A crushed emerald worth 100 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sign of Sealing (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like sign of sealing, except that it can also be used to seal an open space (such as a corridor or an archway), creating a magical barrier of force that repels any creature attempting to pass. In addition, doors and objects protected by a greater sign of sealing are strengthened, increasing their hardness by 10 and granting them an extra 5 hit points per caster level. Any object protected by a greater sign of sealing is treated as a magic item for the purpose of making saving throws and gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If its seal is broken, a greater sign of sealing deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) in a 40-foot radius (Reflex half). A greater sign of sealing cannot be passed with a knock spell, but it can be dispelled (DC 15 + the caster level of the sign's creator). It can be disarmed with a DC 31 Disable Device check. Material Component: A crushed emerald worth at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Silent Portal.MOD					DESC:This simple cantrip negates the sound of opening and closing a single portal (door, window, gate, drawer, chest lid, or the like). Even the squeakiest door opens without a sound when under the effect of this spell. Silent portal coversonly the normal means of opening and closing the targeted portal. Breaking a window or kicking in a door still makes noise, but opening a door that is loosely hanging by its hinges does not (since this is the normal way a door would be opened). Portals composed of magical energy are not affected by this spell. In the case of magic or even intelligent portals, spell resistance and a Will save (DC 10 + caster's ability modifier + other modifiers as appropriate) apply|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Silverbeard.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like sign of sealing, except that it can also be used to seal an open space (such as a corridor or an archway), creating a magical barrier of force that repels any creature attempting to pass. In addition, doors and objects protected by a greater sign of sealing are strengthened, increasing their hardness by 10 and granting them an extra 5 hit points per caster level. Any object protected by a greater sign of sealing is treated as a magic item for the purpose of making saving throws and gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If its seal is broken, a greater sign of sealing deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) in a 40-foot radius (Reflex half). A greater sign of sealing cannot be passed with a knock spell, but it can be dispelled (DC 15 + the caster level of the sign's creator). It can be disarmed with a DC 31 Disable Device check. Material Component: A crushed emerald worth at least 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sink.MOD						DESC:When this spell is cast, it causes the targets, which must be currently in water or another liquid, to sink. Each subject descends 100 feet down into the liquid (or to the bottom, if the liquid is not deep enough). Affected creatures can then swim up normally. Once on the bottom, a creature must still make a Swim check to move, or else it can move along the bottom at one-quarter its land speed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sirine's Grace.MOD				DESC:For the duration of this spell, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma and Dexterity, a deflection bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier, and a +8 bonus on Perform checks. You also gain a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to breathe water. You can move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing or bludgeoning weapons. Material Component: A shard of mirror.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Skeletal Guard.MOD				DESC:You create a number of loyal skeletons from fingerbones. Treat all skeletons as human warrior skeletons (MM 226), except that each one has turn resistance equal to your caster level - 1. You can create one skeleton per caster level. These skeletons count toward the number of Hit Dice of undead you can have in your control (4 HD per caster level, as with animate dead). Material Component: One finger bone from a humanoid and one onyx gem worth 50 gp per skeleton to be created.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Skull Watch.MOD					DESC:The skull affected by a skull watch spell floats gently 5 feet off the ground, facing a direction you choose. It monitors an area 20 feet wide by 90 feet long, though walls and other opaque barriers can curtail this area. If any Tiny or larger living creature enters the area guarded by the skull, it emits a piercing shriek that can be heard up to a quarter mile away. Every creature within 60 feet of the skull when it shrieks must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6 rounds. Whether or not you can hear this audible alarm, you instantly become aware that the effect has been triggered, provided you are on the same plane as it is. The alarm resets 1d4 rounds later. When you cast the spell, you can specify creatures that will not trigger the alarm. The skull can be moved from its original position by anyone who can get to it without entering its monitored area. The skull has AC 12, hardness 1, and 1 hit point per caster level. You are not magically made aware of the skull's destruction if it has not been triggered. Focus: The humanoid skull upon which the spell is cast.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Slapping Hand.MOD					DESC:This spell distracts the subject, causing it to immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening its space. The spell allows no saving throw, but a slapped creature can negate the effect with a DC 20 Concentration check. Focus: A leather glove.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Slashing Darkness.MOD				DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. A creature struck by this ray of negative energy takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature instead heals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Slide.MOD						DESC:You slide the subject creature along the ground a distance of 5 feet in any direction. (If the creature is flying or otherwise not on the ground, it moves parallel to the ground.) You can't slide the subject into a space that is occupied by an ally, an enemy, or a solid object; if you attempt to do so, the spell automatically ends. You cannot slide the subject up or down, but you can slide it over the edge of a cliff or other drop-off if you desire. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Slide (Greater).MOD				DESC:You slide the subject creature along the ground a distance of 5 feet in any direction. (If the creature is flying or otherwise not on the ground, it moves parallel to the ground.) You can't slide the subject into a space that is occupied by an ally, an enemy, or a solid object; if you attempt to do so, the spell automatically ends. You cannot slide the subject up or down, but you can slide it over the edge of a cliff or other drop-off if you desire. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Slime Wave.MOD					DESC:You create a wave of green slime (DMG 76) that begins at the point of origin you choose and violently spreads to the limit of the area. The wave splashes and splatters as it passes; some slime clings to any wall or ceiling the wave touches. Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact, and even dissolves metal. Each creature in the area is covered with one patch of green slime. Unlike normal green slime, the slime created by this spell gradually evaporates, disappearing by the end of the duration. Material Component: A few drops of stagnant pond water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Slow Burn.MOD					DESC:This spell lends fuel to existing fires within the spell's area, allowing them to burn off the intangible power of passion as much as from physical substance. Because these fires consume less of the physical fuel that sustain them, they burn for twice as long without losing any of their intensity, but their illumination radius is halved. In addition, an affected fire is much harder to extinguish. It takes twice as long to put out a fire that is under the effect of this spell, and if a roll is required (such as the Reflex save required to extinguish flames if a creature is on fire), two successful rolls over 2 rounds are required to successfully put out the fire. If one such roll fails, the creature must begin trying to extinguish the flames again as if it had never succeeded on the first roll. Magical fire used against a target in this spell's area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, does not burn as effectively, and fire damage from such sources is reduced by 1 point per die. Slow burn counters or dispels the effect of raging flame (page 164). Arcane Material Component: An oilfilled hourglass.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Smell of Fear.MOD					DESC:You bestow on your target an aroma that attracts predatory animals. They prefer to attack the subject over other targets, and animals attacking the subject creature gain a +1 bonus per three caster levels (maximum +3) on attack rolls and damage rolls.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snake's Swiftness.MOD				DESC:The subject can immediately make one melee or ranged attack. Taking this action doesn't affect the subject's normal place in the initiative order. This is a single attack and follows the standard rules for attacking. This spell does not allow the subject to make more than one additional attack in a round. If the subject has already made an additional attack, due to a prior casting of this spell, from the haste spell, or from any other source, this spell fails. Arcane Material Component: A few scales from a snake.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snake's Swiftness (Mass).MOD			DESC:The subjects can immediately make one melee or ranged attack. Taking this action doesn't affect the subject's normal place in the initiative order. This is a single attack and follows the standard rules for attacking. This spell does not allow the subject to make more than one additional attack in a round. If the subject has already made an additional attack, due to a prior casting of this spell, from the haste spell, or from any other source, this spell fails. Arcane Material Component: A few scales from a snake.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snakebite.MOD					DESC:This spell transforms one of your arms into a poisonous serpent. As an attack action, you can strike an opponent with your snake arm by making a successful melee attack. The bite from the venomous serpent deals damage equal to 1d3 points + your Str modifier, and it carries a toxic venom that deals 2 points of Constitution damage as initial and secondary damage. Each instance of ability damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC equal to this spell's DC). You can't hold a weapon with your transformed hand, but your other hand can be used to wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components. Attacking with the transformed hand and a weapon incurs the standard twoweapon fighting penalties (PH 160). You can be under the effect of only one snakebite spell at any given time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sniper's Eye.MOD					DESC:When you cast sniper's eye, you gain the following benefits. . +10 competence bonus on Spot checks. . Darkvision out to 60 feet. . The ability to make a ranged sneak attack at a range of up to 60 feet, rather than 30 feet. . The ability to make a death attack with a ranged weapon rather than just with a melee weapon. The target must be within 60 feet. This spell doesn't grant you the ability to make a sneak attack or death attack if you don't already have that ability. Sniper's eye attunes you completely to the vantage point you had when you cast the spell. You understand the nuances of the breeze and every angle and shadow-from that spot. If you move even 5 feet from the place where you cast the spell, you lose the benefits of sniper's eye until you return to that spot. Focus: A magnifying glass lens.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sniper's Shot.MOD					DESC:Your ranged attacks made before the start of your next turn can be sneak attacks regardless of the distance between you and your target. You must still fulfill the other conditions for making a sneak attack against the target. This spell doesn't grant you the ability to make a sneak attack if you don't already have that ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snowball Swarm.MOD				DESC:A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you select. The swarm of snowballs deals 2d6 points of cold damage to creatures and objects within the burst. For every two caster levels beyond 3rd, the snowballs deal an extra 1d6 points of damage, to a maximum of 5d6 at 9th level or higher. Material Component: A piece of ice or a small white rock chip.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snowshoes.MOD					DESC:The affected creature can walk lightly over ice and snow without having its speed reduced. The affected creature gains a 10-foot enhancement bonus to speed and is not required to make a Balance check or Reflex save to walk on ice and snow without slipping and falling, to avoid cracking ice it walks over, or to avoid falling through cracked ice. In addition, the affected creature does not leave a more readily discernible trail through ice and snow than it does on solid ground, denying trackers potential bonuses to follow the affected creature's path. (See Weather, DMG 93-95, and Cold Dangers, DMG 302, for more details on the effects of weather and ice.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Snowshoes (Mass).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like snowshoes, except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Solipism.MOD					DESC:You manipulate the senses of one creature so that it perceives itself to be the only real creature in all of existence and everything around it to be merely an illusion. If the target fails its save, it is convinced of the unreality of every situation it might encounter. It takes no actions, not even purely mental actions, and instead watches the world around it with bemusement. The subject becomes effectively helpless and takes no steps to defend itself from any threat, since it considers any hostile action merely another illusion.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Songbird.MOD					DESC:You acquire an even greater charisma when you perform. Anyone who hears or views your performance becomes favorably inclined toward you. This spell grants you a +1 competence bonus on your next Charisma-based check involving any one person who saw the performance. This effect lasts for the duration of your performance and up to 1 hour immediately following. You must begin the performance within 1 hour of casting the spell for it to have any effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sonic Blast.MOD					DESC:You blast the target with loud and highpitched sounds. The subject takes 1d4 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4) and must make a Will save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. This spell has no effect if cast into the area of a silence spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sonic Rumble.MOD					DESC:You create a cone of powerful sound. If used to attack, the cone deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per two levels (maximum 10d6) each round a creature is within the area; a successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half. Targets within the area of a silence spell are immune. Focus: A hollow cone of brass and gold worth 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sonic Snap.MOD					DESC:You create a brief but loud noise adjacent to the target. The subject takes 1 point of sonic damage and must succeed on a Will saving throw or be deafened for 1 round. This spell has no effect if cast into the area of a silence spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sonic Weapon.MOD					DESC:You create a brief but loud noise adjacent to the target. The subject takes 1 point of sonic damage and must succeed on a Will saving throw or be deafened for 1 round. This spell has no effect if cast into the area of a silence spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sonic Whip.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a whip of sonic energy that you wield as if you had proficiency with it. Simply cracking a sonic whip as a free action keeps normal animals (but not dire animals, magical beasts, or vermin) at bay unless they succeed on a Will save. Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell, as space permits. On a successful ranged attack with the whip, any normal animal you strike must succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Against other creature types, you can use a sonic whip in combat as if it were a normal whip. Material Component: A miniature silk whip.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sonorous Hum.MOD					DESC:After you cast this spell, the next spell you cast within the duration that requires concentration to maintain is maintained for you until the sonorous hum spell expires. This effect allows you to cast other spells, even another spell that also requires concentration. If the spell maintained by the sonorous hum has a shorter duration than that of this spell, the maintained spell expires as it normally would, and you gain no further benefits from this casting of sonorous hum. The sound created by the spell is as loud as a person in armor walking at a slow pace trying not to make noise (normally a DC 5 Listen check to detect). You can end the spell as a free action. For example, you could cast this spell, then cast detect thoughts, and this spell maintains the concentration on detect thoughts while you cast discern lies and maintain concentration on that spell yourself. You control all aspects of both spells, so you could change the orientation of the detect thoughts effect and select a different target for your discern lies spell in the same round. If you take damage, you must still make a Concentration check to maintain the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sound Lance.MOD					DESC:This spell causes a projectile of intense sonic energy to leap from you to a target within range. The sound deals 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A sound lance cannot penetrate the area of a silence spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spark of Life.MOD					DESC:For the duration of the spell, the undead creature is subject to extra damage from critical hits (and thus sneak attacks), nonlethal damage, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, and damage to its physical ability scores (though it still lacks a Constitution score and thus can't take Constitution damage) as if it were alive. It loses its immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save, as well as its invulnerability to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, and death effects. However, an undead affected by this spell gains a bonus on its Fortitude saves equal to its Charisma bonus (if any). (The bonus doesn't apply to Fortitude saves against effects that also affect objects.) It must breathe, eat, and sleep just like a normal living creature (though the last two aren't likely to come into play thanks to the spell's short duration). While it is under the effect of this spell, both negative energy (such as inflict spells) and positive energy (such as cure spells) heal damage to the undead creature, rather than damaging it. An undead creature affected by this spell retains all of its other traits.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spawn Screen.MOD					DESC:The subject does not rise as an undead spawn should it perish from an undead's attack that normally would turn it into a spawn, such as from the bite of a ghoul (MM 118). This spell doesn't prevent the subject from perishing or provide anything other than insurance that the subject's body and spirit cannot be hijacked by an acquisitive undead creature. The protection applies if the duration is still in effect when the subject first dies; the spell need not linger in its effect during the period immediately prior to a spawn's rise. This spell cannot be cast on the body of a creature that has already been killed by a spawncreating undead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Speak to Allies.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like message (PH 253), except as noted above and that you and the recipients don't have to mouth the words or whisper, which means that those skilled in reading lips have no opportunity to learn the messages.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spectral Touch.MOD				DESC:Each melee touch attack you successfully make during the spell's duration channels negative energy that bestows one negative level on the target and grants you 5 temporary hit points. This spell cannot give you more temporary hit points than your normal starting hit points (your hit point total cannot exceed two times your normal starting hit points). Both the negative level and the temporary hit points last for up to 1 hour. You can use this attack once per round for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. Any charges of the spell not used by the time the duration expires are lost. An undead creature you touch instead gains 5 temporary hit points and you lose a like amount (no save). Temporary hit points gained in this way last for up to 1 hour.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spectral Weapon.MOD				DESC:Using material from the Plane of Shadow, you can fashion a quasi-real melee weapon of any type with which you are proficient. This spectral weapon appears in your hand and behaves as a normal weapon of its type, with two exceptions. First, you resolve attacks with your spectral weapon as melee touch attacks instead of melee attacks. Second, any foe you hit is entitled to a Will save to recognize the weapon's shadowy, semi-insubstantial nature. If the save is successful, that opponent takes only half damage from the weapon on that attack and all subsequent attacks, and is only 50%% likely to suffer any special effects of your attacks (such as a death attack delivered with the weapon). You can maintain only one spectral weapon at a time, and only you can wield it. The weapon dissipates when you let go of it or when the spell's duration expires, whichever comes first.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Speechlink.MOD					DESC:You and a willing subject can communicate verbally no matter how much distance you put between yourselves on the same plane. Either participant can end the spell at any time. Speechlink allows you and your allies each to hear the other's vocalizations, whatever their volume. It does not transfer other sounds from either participant's location. This spell works on any creatures, including animals, but does not convey any special language comprehension ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Engine.MOD					DESC:Upon casting this spell, you can swap out any or all of your prepared spells for other spells from your spellbook. Each prepared spell must be swapped for a spell of the same level. Empty spell slots from a spell cast earlier in the day (including the casting of this spell) cannot be refreshed. Preparing spells within the light provided by a spell engine takes only half as long as normal. Material Components: A disk of polished bone, one of your tears, and a silver wheel worth 500 gp. XP Cost: 250 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Enhancer.MOD				DESC:This spell enhances the next spell you cast, making it more difficult for targets to resist. The next spell you cast this round is cast at +2 caster level, and its save DC increases by 1.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Flower.MOD					DESC:You are able to hold the charge for one touch spell per arm of your body as long as you don't use a changed limb to cast another spell or touch anything with it. Each touch spell you cast resides in a different forelimb. For the duration of this spell, any touch spells you cast are discharged only if you cast another spell with that forelimb or touch something with that forelimb. For example, a human sorcerer casts this spell, then casts chill touch and holds the charge in his left hand, then casts shocking grasp and holds the charge in his right hand. Because of the spell flower, he can hold the charge on both of these spells at the same time. If he casts another spell with a somatic component (which requires the use of one of his hands), he immediately loses one of his held touch spells (his choice), but if the spell he casts is also a touch spell, he can immediately hold the charge in the available hand. If he chooses to attack with a touch spell, it works normally. Since he has multiple limbs that are considered armed, he can make an off-hand attack with the other touch spell in the same round, with the normal penalties for fighting with two weapons (PH 160). A marilith spellcaster could do the same as the sorcerer in the previous example, except that she could hold the charge on up to six touch spells. She could also use any of her spell-like or supernatural abilities, since those do not interfere with holding a charge. If the spell flower effect ends, the most recent touch spell cast remains as a held charge and all other held spells dissipate.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Immunity (Lesser).MOD			DESC:This spell protects one creature from a single 1st- or 2nd-level spell. The creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the chosen spell. Lesser spell immunity can't protect a creature from a spell to which spell resistance doesn't apply. This spell works against other spells, spell-like effects, and innate spell-like abilities. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a school of spells or a group of spells with similar effects; thus, a creature given immunity to inflict light wounds is still susceptible to inflict moderate wounds. A creature can have only one lesser spell immunity or spell immunity (PH 282) in effect at a time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Matrix.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like lesser spell matrix, except that you can store up to two spells of up to 3rd level, and you take 2d6 points of damage instead of 1d6 upon casting. The matrix closes after 2 rounds and no more spells can be added, even if it is not full. In addition, you can decide to link the two spells stored in the matrix into a spell sequence if both are 2nd level or lower. You can then discharge the two linked spells as a single swift action, just as if you were casting the lone spell from a spell matrix. Focus: A sapphire with a minimum value of 1,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Matrix (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like lesser spell matrix, except that you can store up to three spells of up to 3rd level, and you take 3d6 points of damage instead of 1d6 upon casting. The matrix closes after 3 rounds and no more spells can be added, even if it is not full. In addition, you can designate one spell or one spell sequence held in the matrix to come into effect under a condition you dictate when casting greater spell matrix. The spell (or sequence of spells) to be activated by the triggering condition must be of a type that affects your own person, such as levitate or feather fall. The conditions required to bring the desired spell or spells into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, greater spell matrix immediately brings into effect the designated spell or sequence of spells, which is cast instantaneously when the designated circumstances occur. You cannot choose to have the spell or spells not activate when the triggering event occurs. Focus: A diamond with a minimum value of 1,500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Matrix (Lesser).MOD			DESC:You prepare a magical matrix that allows you to store one of your spells and use it later as a swift action. In the round after you cast lesser spell matrix, you can cast one spell of up to 3rd level to be stored in it. The matrix closes after 1 round, whether or not you have stored a spell in it. Only a spell that can be altered by the Quicken Spell feat can be placed in the matrix, and any spell stored there is treated as a prepared spell. Casting lesser spell matrix deals 1d6 points of damage to you, and this damage cannot be healed by any means while the matrix exists. While the matrix is active, you can cast the spell stored in it as a swift action. Once it is cast from the matrix, the spell is gone. A dispel magic spell that successfully dispels the matrix also dispels the spell held inside it. If you are affected by an antimagic field, the duration of the matrix is interrupted, but the spell does not activate. The matrix becomes active again when you emerge from the antimagic field. If you die while the spell is still held in the matrix, both the spell and the matrix dissipate harmlessly. Focus: A piece of amber with a minimum value of 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Resistance (Mass).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like spell resistance (PH 282), except as noted here.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spell Vulnerability.MOD				DESC:This spell reduces the subject's spell resistance by 1 per caster level (maximum reduction 15). This reduction can't lower a subject's spell resistance below 0.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sphere of Ultimate Destruction.MOD		DESC:You create a terrible sphere that destroys anything it touches. The sphere flies up to 30 feet per round. The sphere stops moving when it enters a space containing a creature, automatically striking it. You must actively direct it to a new target as a move action. When struck by the sphere, a subject takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust (though its equipment is unaffected). When used against an object, the sphere disintegrates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is disintegrated. The effects of the sphere count as a disintegrate spell for the purpose of destroying a wall of force or any other spell or effect specifically affected by disintegrate. If the sphere moves beyond the spell's range, it winks out. Material Component: A pinch of dust from a disintegrated creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spider Curse.MOD					DESC:You turn a humanoid into a creature resembling a drider (MM 89) that obeys your mental commands. The transmuted subject gains a spider's body with a humanoid head, arms, and torso, just like a drider. The subject has a drider's speed, natural armor, bite attack, and poison (but see below). The subject gains a +4 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The subject becomes size Large, with a space of 10 feet and a reach of 5 feet. The subject gains a -1 penalty to AC and on attack rolls due to size. The subject retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in Constitution), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores might affect final Armor Class, attack, and save bonuses.) The subject's equipment remains and continues to function as long as it fits a drider's body shape. Otherwise it is subsumed into the new form and ceases to function for the duration of the spell. Retained items include anything worn on the upper body (head, neck, shoulders, hands, arms, and waist). Nonfunctioning items include anything worn on the legs, feet, or the whole body (armor, robes, vestments, and boots). The subject's bite delivers a poison with a Fortitude save DC of 16 + your Wisdom bonus. Initial and secondary damage is 1d6 points of Strength damage. Your control over the subject is like that provided by a dominate person spell (PH 224). (You telepathically control the creature as long as it remains within range.)|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spider Plague.MOD					DESC:This spell summons five celestial or fiendish Large monstrous spiders (MM 289). They appear where you designate and act immediately, on your turn. They attack your opponents to the best of their ability. If you can communicate with the spiders, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. A celestial spider summoned by this spell has damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance 9; and a smite evil attack that provides a +4 bonus on one damage roll. A fiendish creature (MM 107) summoned by this spell has damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 9; and a smite good attack that provides a +4 bonus on one damage roll. When you use a summoning spell to summon an evil or good creature, it is a spell of that type.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spider Poison.MOD					DESC:You poison a subject by making a successful melee touch attack. The poison deals 1d6 points of Strength damage immediately and another 1d6 points of Strength damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your relevant spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards and assassins, Charisma for sorcerers)). Material Component: A poisonous spider, alive or dead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spider Shapes.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like polymorph (PH 283), except that you polymorph up to one willing creature per level into a monstrous spider (MM 288) of any size from Tiny to Huge as you decide. Unlike with polymorph, this spell allows the subjects to gain a spider's poisonous bite. All the creatures you transmute must become spiders of the same size. Subjects remain in the spider form until the spell expires or you dismiss the spell for all subjects. In addition, an individual subject can choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action. Doing so ends the spell for that creature only.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spiderform.MOD					DESC:You can polymorph into a drider (MM 89) or a Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large monstrous spider (MM 288). You regain lost hit points as if you rested for a day on the initial transformation. The spell lasts until you decide to resume your normal shape. You acquire the physical and natural abilities of the creature you polymorph into, including natural size, Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, armor, attack routines, and movement capabilities. You also acquire the poisonous bite and web-spinning ability of whichever spider form you choose. You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in Constitution), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores might affect final attack and save bonuses.) You can cast spells and use magic items if you choose drider form, but no other spider form is capable of spellcasting or manipulating devices. If you choose drider form, your equipment remains and continues to function as long as it fits a drider's body shape. Retained items include anything worn on the upper body (head, neck, shoulders, hands, arms, and waist). Otherwise your equipment is subsumed into the new form and ceases to function for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spiderskin.MOD					DESC:The spell grants the recipient a +1 enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor bonus, a +1 racial bonus on saves against poison, and a +1 racial bonus on Hide checks for every three caster levels you have. This means that the bonuses to natural armor, saves, and Hide checks improve to +2 at caster level 6th, +3 at caster level 9th, +4 at 12th, and +5 at 15th. The enhancement bonus provided by spiderskin stacks with the subject's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0. Arcane Material Component: The leg of a spider.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spikes.MOD						DESC:This spell functions like brambles (page 38), except that the affected weapon gains a +2 enhancement bonus on its attack rolls, and its threat range is doubled. This effect does not stack with other effects that increase a weapon's threat range, such as the Improved Critical feat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spirit Worm.MOD					DESC:You create a lingering decay in the spirit and body of the target. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1 point of Constitution damage each round while the spell lasts (maximum 5 points). The victim can attempt a Fortitude saving throw each round, and success negates the Constitution damage for that round and ends the spell. Material Component: A piece of fireblackened ivory or bone carved in the shape of a segmented worm.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spiritjaws.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a set of powerful jaws of force. The jaws attempt to grapple the designated opponent, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. The spiritjaws use your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) + your Wis modifier as its attack bonus. If an initial attack hits, the spiritjaws deal 2d6 points of damage and attempt to start a grapple as a free action. The jaws' bonus on grapple checks is equal to their attack bonus + 4. Once the opponent is grappled, the jaws deal 2d6 points of damage with each subsequent grapple check. The target is considered to be grappling and cannot move. The target creature no longer threatens squares and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC against opponents not grappling it. The set of jaws always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. Your feats do not affect the jaws. If the jaws move beyond the range of the spell, they vanish. Attacking the set of jaws has no effect. As a magical force effect, the jaws cannot be damaged, but disintegrate or a sphere of annihilation destroys the effect. The grappled opponent can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in hand, and a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) is made. A creature grappled by the set of jaws can attempt to escape by succeeding on a grapple check against the jaws or by making a successful Escape Artist check as a standard action opposed by the set of jaws' grapple check. As a free action, you can direct the jaws to pin a grappled opponent instead of dealing damage with a grapple check. If the jaws win the opposed grapple check, the opponent is pinned. A pinned opponent is held immobile and must break the pin before it can escape the grapple. Creatures other than those grappling the pinned target gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls to hit it. If the jaws have multiple attacks (granted by your attack bonus), you can use them to cause damage to a pinned target or to make more grapple attempts against that target. If you become unable to command the jaws, they vanish. Material Component: A piece of bone from a dinosaur's jaw.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spiritual Chariot.MOD				DESC:You conjure a chariot of force. When the chariot appears, your special mount is correctly harnessed to it. The chariot can hold one Medium creature or two Small creatures plus the driver (usually the paladin). Although the chariot seems large and sturdy, it and its occupants have no weight for the purpose of the mount's load, so the mount can travel at full speed. If the chariot is ever unhitched from the special mount, it disappears. The driver of the spiritual chariot gains a +4 sacred bonus on Handle Animal checks. The chariot is made of magical force and has immunity to most types of damage. It interacts with other spells just as a wall of force (PH 298) does. Those in the chariot have cover based on their size and the position of their attackers. In most situations, Medium creatures inside the chariot gain cover.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spiritwall.MOD					DESC:One side of the wall, selected by you, emits a low groaning that causes creatures within 60 feet of that side to make a Will save or become frightened and flee for 1d4 rounds. Any living creature that merely touches the wall takes 1d10 points of damage as its life force is disrupted. A living creature passing through the wall takes 1d10 points of damage, as above, and must make a Fortitude save or gain one negative level. The barrier is semimaterial and opaque, providing cover and total concealment against physical attacks, and it blocks line of effect for magical effects (including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities). Material Component: A clear cut gemstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Splinterbolt.MOD					DESC:You must make a ranged attack to hit the target. If you hit, the splinterbolt deals 4d6 points of piercing damage. A splinterbolt threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. You can fire one additional splinterbolt for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three at 11th level). You can fire these splinterbolts at the same or different targets, but all splinterbolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously. A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from splinterbolt is treated as magic and piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Material Component: A splinter of wood.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Spontaneous Search.MOD				DESC:The subject of this spell knows the contents of a 20-foot-radius burst, as if it had taken 10 on a Search check for each object and space in the burst radius, including noting the location of traps (though only a rogue can locate those traps with a DC greater than 20). Material Component: A silk glove.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stabilize.MOD					DESC:This spell, designed to work on the battlefield, allows you to stabilize the dying all around you. A burst of positive energy spreads out from you, healing 1 point of damage to all living creatures in the affected area, whether allied or not. This spell deals 1 point of damage to undead creatures, which are allowed a Will saving throw to negate the effect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stalking Brand.MOD				DESC:This spell marks your target with a tiny symbol visible only to you and to detect magic. The brand appears as you envision it, approximately 1 inch in diameter. You can see the brand even if the subject uses magical means to change or hide its appearance. Spells such as disguise self, polymorph, and invisibility do not hide the brand. To your eyes, the mark glows a light green.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stalwart Pact.MOD					DESC:Once this spell is cast, it remains dormant until the subject is reduced to half or less of its full normal hit points. Once the subject has taken enough damage to reduce it to half or lower hit points, it immediately gains 5 temporary hit points per two caster levels (maximum 35 hit points at 14th level), damage reduction 5/magic, and a +2 luck bonus on saving throws. The hit points, damage reduction, and saving throw bonus disappear when the spell ends. Material Component: Incense worth 250 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Standing Wave.MOD					DESC:You command the waters to lift a creature or object and propel it forward. An object so lifted can contain creatures or other objects. The maximum size of the creature or object the wave can lift depends on your caster level. Caster Level Size of Creature or Object 5th Medium 7th Large 9th Huge 11th Gargantuan 13th Colossal Standing wave moves the lifted creature or object in a straight line at a speed of 60 feet over water. The spell dissipates when the wave contacts land, lowering its burden harmlessly to shore. If you are riding in or standing on the object, the object continues to move until you are no longer in or on the object or the spell is dismissed; otherwise, the object is moved to the extent of the spell's range when you cast the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Starvation.MOD					DESC:You inflict wracking hunger pangs on the target creature. It must make a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and become fatigued. A creature that makes a successful save takes half damage and is not fatigued by the spell. A fatigued creature becomes exhausted when doing anything that causes the creature to become fatigued (such as dangerous environmental temperatures or ending a barbarian rage). A fatigued creature that fails its saving throw against starvation takes nonlethal damage as normal and becomes exhausted. Material Component: A piece of spoiled food.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Steeldance.MOD					DESC:The two daggers hover about you, attacking foes that come near. On your turn, each blade can make an attack at an adjacent opponent, with an attack bonus equal to your caster level + your relevant ability modifier. The damage they deal is equal to the normal weapon damage (1d4 for daggers) + your ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards and Charisma for sorcerers). The weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Your blades can be attacked with sunder or disarm attempts as if you were wielding them, and they use the above attack bonus to resolve such situations. Disarming a weapon under the effect of steeldance ends the spell for that weapon. Focus: Two bladed weapons, such as daggers or longswords.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stick.MOD						DESC:Stick affixes one object weighing up to 5 pounds to another object. The two items can be separated with even a small amount of force, such as a wind stronger than 10 mph, a mage hand or unseen servant spell, or a move action by any corporeal creature (which provokes attacks of opportunity). Material Component: A bit of dried glue.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sticky Fingers.MOD				DESC:This spell grants you a +10 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sticky Saddle.MOD					DESC:This spell "glues" you to your mount. It becomes impossible for you to fall or be thrown off your mount. Prying you from the saddle requires a DC 20 Strength check, and you gain a +10 bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. The spell must be cast after you are seated on your mount. If you are not seated on your mount when the spell is cast, the spell fails. If the spell is cast while you are riding bareback, you are "stuck" to the mount's back. Otherwise, you are merely stuck to the saddle, but the saddle is attached to the mount normally. If you are knocked unconscious while this spell is in effect, you automatically remain in the saddle. The spell can be dismissed as an immediate action, and it does not impede the rider from making a soft fall if the mount is dropped in battle.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sting Ray.MOD					DESC:You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. When this ray successfully strikes, it creates a sensation of many tiny insects biting and crawling on the victim's body. The target can attempt a Will save each round to shake off the effect. Until the spell is shrugged off, the victim is hampered by the unsettling feeling of all the stinging and biting, and is able to perform only a single move or standard action each round. The victim also takes a -2 penalty to AC. In addition, if the victim attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a Concentration check with a DC equal to the sting ray's DC + the level of the spell the subject is attempting to cast. For example, if a 6th-level sorcerer with a Charisma score of 16 casts sting ray on a wizard casting a fireball, the Concentration check DC is 19 (16 [sting ray DC] + 3 [fireball spell level]). A successful Will save negates the effect restricting the subject's action to one move or one standard action each round, nor does the subject need to make a Concentration check each time it wishes to cast a spell. However, the subject still takes the penalty to AC for the duration of the spell with a successful save. Material Component: Four dried stinging insects (bees, wasps, and so on).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stolen Breath.MOD					DESC:With this spell, you steal all the air from the subject's lungs, causing it to suffer a momentary respiratory crisis. It can take shallow breaths and act normally but is considered sickened for 1 minute. At any time during this minute, the subject can take a full-round action to get its wind back, ending the condition. Focus: A stoppered glass vial.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stone Body.MOD					DESC:This spell transforms your body into living stone, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain damage reduction 10/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, extra damage from critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, but you take a -4 penalty to Dexterity (minimum Dexterity 1). Your speed is reduced to one-half normal, and your weight increases by a factor of three. If you are targeted with transmute rock to mud, you are slowed for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. A transmute mud to rock heals you of all your lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell cast on you automatically ends this spell. Arcane Material Component: A small piece of stone that was once part of a stone golem, a greater earth elemental, or a castle's outer wall.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stone Bones.MOD					DESC:You cause the skeleton of the target corporeal undead to become thicker and as strong as stone. This gives the subject a +3 enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor. Arcane Focus: A miniature skull carved of granite.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stone Shape (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like stone shape (PH 284), except that it affects a much larger quantity of stone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stone Shatter.MOD					DESC:You aim a single note of perfect pitch toward an unattended stone object weighing no more than 2 pounds per caster level, or toward a stone creature, causing it to shatter. A stone object is destroyed, whereas a stone creature (of any weight) takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stone Sphere.MOD					DESC:You create a smoothly polished, 5-footdiameter sphere of stone that moves under your control at a speed of 30 feet. A stone sphere has AC 5, hardness 8, and 500 hit points. In the round when you cast the spell, the stone sphere appears at the spot you designate within the spell's range, and you can direct its movement as a free action. In subsequent rounds, you must actively direct the stone sphere in order to move it; otherwise, it remains motionless. Directing the movement of a stone sphere in any round after its initial appearance requires a move action. If you move a stone sphere into a square occupied by an enemy, it stops moving and deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to every creature in that square. A successful Reflex save negates the damage. Material Component: A smooth sphere of marble 1 inch in diameter.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stone Spiders.MOD					DESC:This spell transforms three pebbles into stone constructs that resemble monstrous spiders. The constructs can be any size from Tiny to Huge as you decide, but all the constructs you create must be the same size. The constructs have the same statistics as monstrous spiders (MM 288) of the appropriate size, except as noted here. . Their natural armor bonus increases by 6. . They have damage reduction 10/ magic. . Their poison has a Fortitude save DC of 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Wis modifier. Initial and secondary damage is 1d3 points of Strength damage. If the constructs can hear your commands, you can direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. Otherwise, they simply attack your enemies to the best of their ability.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stonehold.MOD					DESC:This spell conjures thick stony arms that spring forth from any rock or stone formation whenever anyone passes near it. Each 10-foot square in the spell's area contains one stone arm. Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immobilized by the arms unless it succeeds on a Reflex save. Such a creature is rooted in place and unable to move. It can take actions normally; it just can't move from the space it currently occupies. Held creatures take 1d6+5 points of damage each round, at the beginning of your turn. Creatures that succeed on the Reflex save can move through the area normally. Creatures that start their turn in the affected area must attempt another Reflex save or be affected by the spell. A held creature can attempt a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to break free, and can also break free by dealing enough damage to destroy the arm. An arm has AC 15, hardness 8, and 15 hit points. Before they attack, the arms remain beneath the surface of the stone. They can be discovered (but not disarmed) as a magic trap can be.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stony Grasp.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like earthen grasp (page 76), except as noted here. The stony arm can appear from any natural surface, including unworked rock, earth, mud, grass, or sand. The stone arm has AC 18, hardness 8, and 4 hit points per caster level. Material Component: A miniature hand sculpted from stone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Storm of Elemental Fury.MOD			DESC:Each round, the storm generates one of the following effects, starting with the first effect, then progressing to the second, until it has run its 4-round course. 1st Round: A storm of elemental fury buffets the area immediately beneath it with a whirling windstorm (DMG 94-95). Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible, and Small or smaller creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blown away. Medium creatures must make their Fortitude save or be knocked prone, and Large or larger creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save to move that round. Flying creatures that fail their saves are instead blown in a random direction, traveling 1d6?5 feet if Large or larger, 1d6?10 feet if Medium, and 2d6?10 feet if Small or smaller. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the storm of elemental fury's save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast. 2nd Round: Chunks of rock fall from the sky, dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save) to all creatures in the storm. 3rd Round: A deluge of rain extinguishes unprotected flames and perhaps protected ones as well (50%% chance). The torrential downpour reduces visibility to 5 feet and cuts movement in half. 4th Round: Flame pelts the area beneath the storm cloud, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) (Reflex half).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Storm Tower.MOD					DESC:A storm tower absorbs any electricity damage dealt to those within it. Magic missiles cannot be cast into, out of, or within a storm tower. The storm tower is composed of windstorm-strength winds (DMG 95), making ranged attacks impossible within it, though it has no effect on the movement of creatures within it. However, only Gargantuan or Colossal creatures can pass through the outer edge of the storm tower; all creatures of smaller size must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw to enter; otherwise, they are checked at the edge. Anyone within a storm tower has concealment relative to those outside the tower. The howling winds of a storm tower also apply a -10 penalty on Listen checks made within 50 feet of it (including all those made inside the tower).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stormrage.MOD					DESC:You can fly at a speed of 40 feet, and you gain immunity to thrown weapons and projectile ranged attacks. You are completely unaffected by natural or magical wind, easily able to hold your position and not subject to other adverse effects of extreme wind. Finally, you can discharge a bolt of electricity from your eyes once per round. You enemies' spell resistance applies to these lightning attacks. Doing this is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, has a range of 100 feet, and requires a ranged touch attack. You gain a +3 bonus on the attack roll if the opponent is wearing metal armor, made out of metal, or carrying a lot of metal. If you hit, the bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw allowed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Strategic Charge.MOD				DESC:You gain the benefit of the Mobility feat (PH p98, +4 Dodge bonus to AC vs attacks of Opportunity), even if you not meet the prerequisites. You do not have to be charging to gain this benefit.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Strength of Stone.MOD				DESC:The spell grants you a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength. The spell ends instantly if you lose contact with the ground. This means you cannot jump, tumble, charge, run, or move more than your speed in a round (because these acts cause both of your feet to leave the ground) without breaking the spell. A natural stone wall or ceiling counts as the ground for the purpose of this spell (so you could climb a cavern wall and not lose the spell).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stun Ray.MOD					DESC:You blast an enemy with a scintillating ray of electricity. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The target is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds by the ray of electricity. If the subject makes a successful Fortitude save, it is stunned for only 1 round. Creatures that have immunity to electricity are not affected by this spell. Material Component: A coiled copper wire.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stunning Breath.MOD				DESC:For this spell to function, you must have a breath weapon that deals hit point damage, either as a supernatural ability or as the result of casting a spell such as dragon breath (page 73). When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue your breath weapon with concussive force that can stun those caught in its area. Creatures that take damage from the breath weapon must make successful Fortitude saves (DC equal to your breath weapon save DC) or be stunned for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Stunning Breath (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like stunning breath, except that creatures that fail their Fortitude saves are stunned for 2d4 rounds.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Submerge Ship.MOD					DESC:You grant the ship touched a swim speed of 60 feet and the ability to move beneath the surface of the water. You can control the ship's speed and direction as a free action. All interior spaces of the ship remain dry even if a doorway or porthole is open while the ship is underwater. Any creature aboard the ship when the spell is cast can move about the ship with ease (including climbing and jumping) as if it were afloat on a calm sea. Such creatures can breathe water for the duration of the spell as long as they remain within 10 feet of the ship. External forces, such as a storm or an angry dragon, can still jostle the ship and cause it to shake and possibly knock passengers and objects from it, but nothing falls from the ship as a result of your direction of its movement. You can transfer control of the ship to another individual by giving that individual the miniature rudder you used as a focus to cast the spell. If the focus is ever lost or becomes unattended, the spell's duration expires. Once the spell ends (either because the duration expired, the focus was lost or became unattended, or the magic was successfully dispelled), the magic lingers for 1 additional round per caster level. During this time, the ship ascends toward the water's surface at a rate of 60 feet per round. If the ship is still underwater when this additional time runs out, it immediately sinks, and its passengers risk drowning. Focus: A miniature wooden rudder inlaid with silver, worth 2,500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Subvert Planar Essence.MOD			DESC:Outsiders within the emanation of a subvert planar essence spell find their connection disrupted with the planar forces that created them. Outsiders that fail their saves have their damage reduction and spell resistance each reduced by 10. For example, a barbed devil subject to subvert planar essence would have no damage reduction and spell resistance 13, while a pit fiend would have damage reduction 5/good and silver, and spell resistance 22. An outsider attempts a Fortitude save and checks spell resistance when it first enter the spell's area. If it makes the save or the spell fails to overcome its spell resistance, that creature is thereafter unaffected by this casting of subvert planar essence and can enter and exit the spell area without making further saves. Outsiders that fail their saves and have their spell resistance overcome by the spell are affected as long as they remain within the spell's area, and they are automatically affected if they leave and reenter the area. Arcane Material Component: A tuning fork made from cold iron.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sudden Stalagmite.MOD				DESC:This spell creates a stalagmite about 1 foot wide at its base and up to 10 feet tall. If it encounters a ceiling before it reaches full size, it stops growing. The stalagmite grows from the ground under the target creature and shoots upward. An airborne creature within 10 feet of the ground gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, and airborne creatures more than 10 feet above the ground cannot be harmed by this spell. The stalagmite deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). In addition, a target that fails to make a saving throw against this spell and takes damage from it is impaled on the stalagmite and cannot move from its current location until it makes a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The stalagmite can be removed in other ways as well, such as with a stone shape spell. The victim can break free with a DC 25 Strength check, although doing this deals it 3d6 points of slashing damage. A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from sudden stalagmite is treated as piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Babau Demon.MOD				DESC:This spell summons a babau demon (MM 40) from the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action. A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Bearded Devil.MOD			DESC:This spell summons a bearded devil (MM 52) from the Nine Hells of Baator. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability.

It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Elemental Monolith.MOD			DESC:You conjure a tremendously powerful creature known as an elemental monolith (Complete Arcane 156). It appears at the spot you designate and acts immediately on your turn, attacking your opponents to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action. If you speak the elemental monolith's language and are close enough to communicate with it, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. A monolith can't be summoned into an environment hostile to it in any way (for example, you couldn't summon a fire monolith underwater or an earth monolith high in midair). When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. Material Component: A gem worth 100 gp-aquamarine for air, tourmaline for earth, garnet for fire, or pearl for water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Elementite Swarm.MOD			DESC:This spell summons an elementite swarm (Planar Handbook 114)-air, earth, fire, or water, at your option- from the appropriate Elemental Plane. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Elysian Thrush.MOD			DESC:This spell summons an elementite swarm (Planar Handbook 114)-air, earth, fire, or water, at your option- from the appropriate Elemental Plane. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability.

The greater elemental appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability.

It understands your speech (regardless of your language), and it follows your commands to the best of its ability. You must concentrate to maintain the spell's effect, but commanding the creature is a free action. A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Undead I.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I (PH 285), except that you summon an undead creature. Summon undead I conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list in the accompanying sidebar. You choose which creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. Summoned undead do not count toward the total Hit Dice of undead that you can control with animate dead or the other command undead abilities. No undead creature you summon can have more Hit Dice than your caster level +1. Focus: A tiny bag, a small (not lit) candle, and a carved bone from any humanoid.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Undead II.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that you can summon one undead from the 2nd-level list or two undead of the same kind from the 1st-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Summon Undead IV.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that you can summon one undead from the 4th-level list, two undead of the same kind from the 3rd-level list, or four undead of the same kind from a lower-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Summon Undead V.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that you can summon one undead from the 5th-level list, two undead of the same kind from the 4thlevel list, or four undead of the same kind from a lower-level list.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Suppress Breath Weapon.MOD			DESC:The subject of this spell cannot use its breath weapon for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Suppress Glyph.MOD				DESC:You gain an enhanced awareness of magical writing within range. Magical writing such as a glyph of warding, explosive runes, sepia snake sigil, or symbol is covered by a blue nimbus of light (which sheds light equal to a candle). This effect reveals the location of the writing without triggering it. For every source of magical writing, you can make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against a DC equal to 11 + the writing's caster level. If you are successful, the magical writing is suppressed for 1 minute per caster level. You and other creatures could then read a book warded by explosive runes, or open a drawer guarded by a glyph of warding, or pass through a doorway protected by a symbol without effect. This spell covers and negates any active or triggered magical writing (such as a quickly scribed symbol of fear or a triggered symbol of death), although creatures that have already succumbed to the effect of the writing are unaffected. Once this spell ends, all magical writing in the area can be triggered normally, and active or triggered writings resume their function if they have any duration left.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Surefoot.MOD					DESC:Your steps are sure and true, even on the narrowest ledges. You gain a +10 competence bonus on Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. In addition, you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC when balancing or climbing.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Surefooted Stride.MOD				DESC:You can move through difficult terrain (PH 163) at full speed for the duration of this spell, and you can even run, charge, and tumble through such terrain as though it were clear terrain. You also gain a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Surefooted Stride (Mass).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like surefooted stride, except as noted here.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Suspended Silence.MOD				DESC:When you touch the object and give the command word you designate, the object becomes the subject of a silence spell. The effect of the silence spell moves with the object and lasts for 6 rounds. Material Component: A feather and a handful of gem dust worth 50 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Swamp Lung.MOD					DESC:This spell causes stagnant swamp water to flood the target's lungs. If the target is unable to breathe water, it must cough it out. If it makes the save, then this expulsion is done with little effort. If it fails the save, the creature falls prone in a coughing fit for 1d6 rounds and is helpless during that time. Furthermore, on a failed save, the subject contracts filth fever (DMG 292). Creatures able to breathe water must make the Fortitude save in order to avoid the disease, but are otherwise unaffected.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Swamp Stride.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like tree stride (PH 296), but it is used for diving into pools of water rather than trees. Each pool must be at least 1 foot deep, and the exit pool of water must be similar in depth to the entry pool (within 1 foot). Unlike with tree stride, each jump has a maximum range of 500 feet. All other effects and limitations are the same.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Swim.MOD						DESC:This spell gives the recipient a swim speed of 30 feet (although not the ability to breathe water or hold one's breath beyond normal limits). As long as the creature isn't carrying more than a light load, it can swim without making Swim checks. It also gains a +8 bonus on any Swim checks to perform special actions or avoid hazards, though it still takes the normal penalty for weight carried (-1 per 5 pounds). The recipient can choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if rushed or threatened, and can use the run action while swimming if it swims in a straight line. If the creature is carrying more than a light load, it must make Swim checks to move (taking the normal penalty for weight carried), but all other benefits of the spell still apply. Material Component: A goldfish scale.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Swim (Mass).MOD					DESC:The spell functions like swim, except that it affects multiple creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sword of Darkness.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like sword of deception (see below), except that you cause a black blade of pure negative energy to appear and attack opponents at a distance, as directed by you. Instead of dealing damage, a sword of darkness bestows one negative level on each successful hit against a living creature, threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20, and bestows two negative levels on a critical hit. Negative levels usually have a chance of permanently draining the subject's levels, but the negative levels from sword of darkness don't last long enough to do so. However, if the subject gains at least as many negative levels as it has Hit Dice, it dies. If the sword strikes an undead creature, it grants that creature 5 temporary hit points per two caster levels (maximum 25 temporary hit points) that last for up to 1 hour. Material Component: A bastard sword or longsword, which is shattered against a stone while casting the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Sword of Deception.MOD				DESC:You cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A sword of deception always strikes from your direction, and so it can't be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies. The blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, each successful hit provides a -2 penalty on the target's next saving throw roll (-4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of -5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a remove curse spell. Each round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round's target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell). If an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the sword of deception is dispelled. If the target goes beyond the spell range or out of your sight, the sword of deception returns to you and hovers. Focus: A miniature replica of a sword and a set of loaded dice.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Symbol of Spell Loss.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like symbol of death (PH 289), except that when it is triggered, the symbol begins to attack the minds of spellcasters within 60 feet. Each must attempt a Will saving throw every round they are within range, at the beginning of their turn. Failure means that the highest-level spell prepared by the spellcaster (or highest-level spell slot, if the character casts spells spontaneously) is lost for the day. The symbol remains active for 10 minutes per level or until it has erased fifty levels of spells. The symbol attacks creatures with spell-like abilities as if they had spells, consuming a daily use of the highest-level ability the creature possesses, or suppressing an ability usable at will for 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Symphonic Nightmare.MOD				DESC:A creature targeted by this spell loses the ability to dream during sleep or rest. Rather, in place of dreams, the subject's slumbering mind is filled with the sounds of a discordant orchestra. After the victim's first attempt to sleep, it incurs a -2 penalty on Wisdom-based skill checks. This penalty persists as long as the symphonic nightmare maintains its hold. This spell affects all creatures that sleep or enter sleeplike trances, although creatures without the need to sleep are effectively immune. In addition, the creature's sleep is now haunted. It can no longer gain complete rest from sleeping or resting. The subject does not regain hit points or heal ability damage naturally, nor is it able to prepare spells if doing so requires a full night's rest. The creature is, however, now immune to the dream and nightmare spells, as well as to other effects that cause nightmares (such as the night hag's dream haunting ability). You can lift the effect of this curse at will, but it is otherwise difficult to remove a symphonic nightmare before its duration expires. A remove curse cast at a higher caster level than the symphonic nightmare spell removes it, as does a successful break enchantment. Otherwise, a wish or miracle is required to lift the curse. This spell can also be cast on a creature you are scrying, or on a creature distant from you if you hold something the creature carried within the past 24 hours. Focus: A small statue of an opened skull, within which is arranged a miniature orchestra. The quality of this component must be extraordinary, and it carries a value of 1,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Synostodweomer.MOD				DESC:You channel the spell energy from a spell you know into healing magic. After you cast this spell, the next spell you cast in the same round is converted to positive energy. When you cast the second spell, you touch yourself or another creature, curing 1d8 points of damage for every spell level of the spell you cast. If the spell you cast was prepared with a metamagic feat, you use the level of the spell slot the spell occupied.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tactical Precision.MOD				DESC:When you cast this spell, you grant your allies greater insight into one another's actions, allowing them to better coordinate their attacks. If two affected allies flank the same creature, each gains a +2 insight bonus on melee attack rolls and deals an extra 1d6 points of damage against the flanked creature. Creatures not subject to extra damage from sneak attacks are immune to this extra damage. Material Component: A toy soldier.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Targeting Ray.MOD					DESC:The ray acts as a rangefinder for you and any allies. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. It provides a +1 insight bonus per three caster levels on ranged attacks directed at the subject for the duration of the spell. Your allies need not see you, but they must be able to see the ray. You can otherwise act normally for the duration of the spell. Allies who can see the target of the ray receive the bonus even if you lose line of sight to the target. Focus: A small metal or stone tube.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telepathic Aura.MOD				DESC:You can mentally communicate with all allies within range, though this is one-way communication. (You can send thoughts, but you cannot receive thoughts in response.) Anything you choose to send is received by all creatures you perceive as allies within the emanation (you cannot send thoughts only to certain allies), and they all understand you regardless of language. Allies with Intelligence scores lower than 3 understand basic commands but not complex information ("Attack" is understood, but "Ignore the foot soldiers and attack the spellcasters" gets the same reaction as "Attack").|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telepathic Bond (Lesser).MOD			DESC:You can mentally communicate with all allies within range, though this is one-way communication. (You can send thoughts, but you cannot receive thoughts in response.) Anything you choose to send is received by all creatures you perceive as allies within the emanation (you cannot send thoughts only to certain allies), and they all understand you regardless of language. Allies with Intelligence scores lower than 3 understand basic commands but not complex information ("Attack" is understood, but "Ignore the foot soldiers and attack the spellcasters" gets the same reaction as "Attack").|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thornskin.MOD					DESC:Your skin sprouts thorns when this spell is cast, increasing the damage you deal with an unarmed strike and making you difficult to grab. As well as dealing lethal damage with your unarmed strikes (if you don't already do so), you deal an extra 1d6 points of piercing damage (so that a human under the effect of thornskin would deal 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage + 1d6 points of piercing damage with an unarmed strike). In addition, any creature that hits you with a natural weapon or unarmed strike (including all successful grapple checks) takes 5 points of piercing damage. A creature's damage reduction, if any, applies to the damage from this spell. The damage from thornskin is treated as piercing for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Material Component: A thorn.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thunderhead.MOD					DESC:Thunderhead creates a small thundercloud over the subject's head. The cloud moves with the subject, following it unerringly even if he becomes invisible or leaves the region. In every round of the spell's duration, a miniature bolt of lightning leaps from the thundercloud to strike the subject. Each bolt deals 1 point of electricity damage that is negated by a successful Reflex save. Material Component: A small piece of copper wire.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thunderlance.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, you create a deadly lance of force. You can freely make a thunderlance retract or grow to any length from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force. This effect gives you a natural reach of 20 feet. You can use a thunderlance to make powerful melee attacks. You can wield a thunderlance in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage (crit 20/?3). Instead of using your Strength modifier, you use the higher of your Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. If you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a shield or mage armor spell, the thunderlance might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check against the level of the caster who created the effect. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled. The thunderlance remains whether you succeed or fail on this check. Material Component: A small metal spear.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Thunderous Roar.MOD				DESC:The resulting blast of sound from the casting of thunderous roar can be heard for miles, but the spell affects only those in its area. All creatures in the affected area take 1d6 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the damage. Additionally, any creature that takes damage from this spell must make a Reflex saving throw or be knocked prone from the force of the roar. Crystalline creatures take 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tidal Surge.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, you create a huge wave of water that slams into one or more targets within range. If no large, natural source of water (a river, lake, or ocean) exists within the spell's range, you can affect only one target. If such a source of water exists within the range of the spell, the spell creates a burst centered on a location you designate. In either case, the water deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to the target or to creatures within the burst. In addition, all affected creatures are subjected to a bull rush attack, forcing them to make opposed Strength checks against the wave of water. The water has a +5 bonus on the opposed Strength check, or a +10 bonus if the spell is cast near a source of water. You designate the direction the wave pushes when you cast the spell; creatures that lose the opposed Strength check are pushed back 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the wave beats their Strength checks, in the chosen direction. It is possible for a wave arising from a body of water to push characters into the water. The wave puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames if they are carried by the target or located within the area and they are Large or smaller. If the wave hits a magical fire, those flames are targeted by a dispel magic effect as if you had cast the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tiger's Tooth.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like magic fang (PH 250), except as noted above.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tortoise Shell.MOD				DESC:Tortoise shell grants a +6 enhancement bonus to the subject's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels beyond 11th, to a maximum of +9 at 20th level. The enhancement bonus provided by tortoise shell stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0. Tortoise shell slows a creature's movement as if it were wearing heavy armor. An elf subject to tortoise shell, for example, would have a speed of 20 feet and could run only 60 feet per round. The spell affects only a creature's speed; tortoise shell doesn't carry an armor check penalty or an arcane spell failure chance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Touch of Madness.MOD				DESC:Tortoise shell grants a +6 enhancement bonus to the subject's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels beyond 11th, to a maximum of +9 at 20th level. The enhancement bonus provided by tortoise shell stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor of +0, much as a character wearing only normal clothing has an armor bonus of +0. Tortoise shell slows a creature's movement as if it were wearing heavy armor. An elf subject to tortoise shell, for example, would have a speed of 20 feet and could run only 60 feet per round. The spell affects only a creature's speed; tortoise shell doesn't carry an armor check penalty or an arcane spell failure chance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Towering Oak.MOD					DESC:You draw on the oak's strength to improve your ability to intimidate your enemies. You gain a +10 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Train Animal.MOD					DESC:While this spell is in effect, the affected animal gains a number of additional tricks equal to half your caster level (maximum five). This spell does not modify an animal's attitude toward you, nor does it guarantee that an animal will cooperate when instructed to perform the newly learned tricks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Transcribe Symbol.MOD				DESC:You place a protective spell upon your hand that allows you to touch an untriggered magic sigil (such as a glyph of warding or a symbol of death) without setting it off. The touched sigil is removed from its location and held as magical potential on your hand, as though it were a touch spell. To pick up a sigil in this manner, you must make a successful caster level check (DC 20 + the target glyph's spell level). Failure indicates that you have triggered the glyph or symbol. If you successfully transfer the sigil to your hand, you can use a standard action to place it on a surface (not a creature) of the sort on which it can normally be scribed. The transferred sigil works normally thereafter and retains all its original triggering conditions, although its current location might make its triggers difficult or impossible to achieve. You can maintain the magic sigil on your hand as long as you concentrate. If your concentration lapses or the spell duration expires while the sigil is thus stored as potential, it immediately triggers upon you (and only you), even if you normally would not meet its trigger conditions. The effect has the same saving throw and spell resistance as the original spell did. The only safe way to rid yourself of the stored sigil is to place it upon a suitable surface. Focus: A piece of slate that has been scoured bare and smooth on one side.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Transfix.MOD					DESC:This spell causes any Medium or smaller humanoids within the area of the spell to become paralyzed. When casting the spell, you must specify a condition that will end it ("Wait here until the dragon arrives"), even if that condition can never feasibly be met ("Stay here until the sun shines at night"). Subjects in the area that fail their saves immediately become aware of the condition, but they cannot communicate it due to their paralyzed state (although someone could use a spell such as detect thoughts to ascertain the condition). For every hour the creatures are transfixed before the condition is met, they are allowed another saving throw to break free of the spell's effect. As long as the spell operates, any Medium or smaller humanoid that enters its area must make a successful saving throw or become transfixed with the same exit conditions (they too become aware of the exit conditions on becoming transfixed). Likewise, any creatures removed from the area are freed from the spell's effect. An affected creature that is attacked gains a new saving throw to break free of the enchantment. Material Component: A drop of pine resin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Translocation Trick.MOD				DESC:You and the other target switch locations, as if simultaneously using dimension door spells (PH 221) and exchange appearances, as if using disguise self spells (PH 222) to appear as each other. Your target can negate this spell with a successful saving throw. If you or your target exceed the capacity of the dimension door spell or if you and your target have bodies that are so different that the disguise self spell could not disguise you as your target, this spell fails. Magic that penetrates disguises (such as true seeing) reveals the identities of you and your target. Otherwise, you are considered to be disguised as your target and vice versa for the duration of the spell. You get a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the target. When the spell ends, you and your target revert to your true appearances in your current locations. You do not switch places again.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Transmute Rock to Lava.MOD			DESC:You transform natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of red-hot molten lava. All creatures in the spell's area that make successful Reflex saves take 6d6 points of fire damage, provided they can physically escape the area on their next turn. Creatures that fail their saves, or those unable to escape the area, take 20d6 points of fire damage in each round they remain in the area. Creatures in the lava have their speed reduced to 5 feet and take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and to Armor Class. Even after leaving the area of the spell, creatures that were exposed to the lava take half damage (either 3d6 or 10d6) for 1 additional round. If transmute rock to lava is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the lava falls to the floor and spreads out in a 15-foot-radius pool at a depth of approximately 1-1/2 feet. The rain of lava deals 2d6 points of fire damage to anyone caught directly beneath (Reflex half). In addition, creatures take 10d6 points of fire damage each round when they are caught in the area of the pool. Although constructions of worked stone can't be targeted with this spell, casting it on unworked stone below or adjacent to such structures deals 10d6 points of fire damage per round to any part of the structure in contact with the lava. Wooden structures in contact with lava instantly burst into flame. The lava cools naturally from its surface toward its center, and it no longer deals fire damage after 2d6 hours as it slowly reverts to stone. Though a 15-foot-radius pool can take as long as two days to completely cool, the core of a 10-foot cube of lava might remain molten for a month or more. Magical or enchanted stone is not affected by the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Traveler's Mount.MOD				DESC:The touched animal or magical beast gets a 20-foot enhancement bonus to its speed, and it can hustle without taking damage or becoming fatigued as long as the spell is in effect. While bearing a rider, the mount no longer attacks in combat. The steed willingly bears its rider into battle; it just can't use its own natural weapons for the duration of the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Treasure Scent.MOD				DESC:You can detect copper, silver, gold, platinum, and gems within 30 feet, as well as differentiate between the five kinds of valuables. When you detect one of these types of valuables, the exact location of the source is not revealed-only its presence and direction. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the treasure, you can pinpoint its exact location. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tremor.MOD						DESC:This minor quake is not strong enough to damage structures. The effect lasts for 1 round per three caster levels, during which time any spellcaster on the ground in the area must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose any spell she is casting. A creature attempting to use a skill that would provoke attacks of opportunity (such as Disable Device, Heal, Open Lock, and Use Rope, among others) must succeed on a DC 15 Concentration check, or the action automatically fails and is wasted. Each creature in the area must make a Reflex save each round or be knocked prone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tremorsense.MOD					DESC:You can automatically pinpoint the location of any object or creature within 30 feet that is in contact with the ground. Arcane Focus: A fleck of skin from a creature that has tremorsense.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Triadspell.MOD					DESC:You alter one of your prepared spells so that you can cast it three times before it is expended. The prepared spell must be of 3rd level or lower, and once the triadspell is cast, you can cast the altered spell two additional times (a total of three times) before it is expended. The altered spell functions normally and requires components or XP for each use as if you were casting three separate spells. If you later choose to prepare a different spell in that spell slot, any extra castings provided by the triadspell are lost. You cannot cast triadspell more than once upon a single prepared spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Creation.MOD					DESC:You create a nonmagical, unattended object of any sort of matter. Items created are permanent and cannot be negated by dispelling magic or negating powers. For all intents and purposes, these items are completely real. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate skill check to make a complex item, such as a Craft (bowmaking) check to make straight arrow shafts or a Craft (gemcutting) check to make a cut and polished gem. Unlike the items brought into being by the lower-level spells minor creation and major creation, objects created by the casting of true creation can be used as material components. Material Component: A small piece of matter of the same type of item you plan to create-a sliver of wood to create arrow shafts, a tiny piece of the appropriate stone to create a polished gem, and so forth. XP Cost: Half the item's gold piece value in XP, or 50 XP, whichever is more.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
True Domination.MOD				DESC:You can control the actions of any humanoid. You establish a telepathic link with the subject's mind. If a common language is shared, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language is shared, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it. Subjects have a chance of resisting this control by making a Will save to avoid the effect when the spell is cast. Those affected by the spell and then forced to take actions against their nature receive a new saving throw with a -4 penalty. Obviously self-destructive orders might be carried out, unless the subject can make a saving throw with the -4 penalty. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but it does not prevent the establishment of domination or dispel it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tsunami.MOD						DESC:This spell creates a towering tsunami and sends it forth in a powerful wave to smash all in its path. The tsunami starts at any point you select within range of the spell and then moves at a speed of 60 feet in any direction chosen by you. Once the direction is set, the tsunami cannot change course. The tsunami deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all in its path. Anything struck can make a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Gargantuan or larger creatures that fail the save are knocked prone. Huge or smaller creatures that fail the save are picked up and carried with the wave. Each round a victim is carried by the tsunami, it takes the bludgeoning damage again and can make an additional Fortitude save for half damage. Creatures being carried by a tsunami cannot move in any other way. They can otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in a tsunami take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. They can escape the wave by making successful DC 20 Swim checks, as long as they end their movement outside the effect of the tsunami. Any creature that comes in contact with a tsunami as a result of movement during its turn is considered to have been struck by the tsunami's movement. A creature can attempt to extract another creature caught by a tsunami, providing the rescuer resists being swept up or knocked down by the tsunami and can reach the victim Extracting a victim in this manner requires a DC 20 Strength check. A tsunami's progress can be halted by anything that would normally block line of effect along its path, assuming the tsunami does not destroy the intervening object or creature. If only a portion of the tsunami is blocked, the rest of it continues on. Although this spell can be cast on dry land, it is most effective when cast on the open sea. In this case, saving throws to avoid full damage are made with a -4 penalty, and the width of the tsunami increases to 40 feet per caster level. A tsunami that begins on water but then travels onto land immediately shrinks to its land size and speed. A tsunami does not vanish if it moves beyond the spell's initial range. Material Component: A crown of coral set with pearls (total value of at least 5,000 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tunnel Swallow.MOD				DESC:You cause a section of tunnel to flex with peristaltic convulsions, crushing its contents and moving them along its length in the direction you designate. Each creature and object in the affected tunnel section is crushed for 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and is moved from its former position to a point just outside the affected tunnel section. A creature that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half damage and is moved halfway from its former position in the tunnel toward the designated end of the tunnel section. When the spell duration expires, the tunnel returns to its former shape and size, with no harm done to its structure. Tunnel swallow affects both worked and natural tunnels, as well as corridors in surface buildings, but does not harm the structure. Movement caused by this spell does not provoke attacks of -opportunity. Material Component: A lump of chewed vegetable or meat.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Unbinding.MOD					DESC:An unbinding spell negates charm and hold spells of all types; arcane locks and similar closures; and spells that create physical or magical barriers, such as wall of fire, wall of force, guards and wards, temporal stasis, and slow spells, among others. The effect of a statue spell is also ended, and a magic jar is shattered-forever destroyed-and the life force within snuffed out. In addition, any spell that holds magical effects, including other spells (magic mouth, imbue with spell ability, and so on), immediately releases them at a range of 0 feet. Protective spells such as protection from evil, shield, globe of invulnerability, and similar spells are not affected by an unbinding. Petrified creatures are neither revealed nor restored. Individuals bound to service are not freed (including creatures such as familiars, invisible stalkers, genies, and elementals). An antimagic field is not affected, nor does the effect of unbinding penetrate one. A magic circle against evil (or another alignment) that currently holds a creature imprisoned is dispelled. Curses and geas/quest spells are negated only if you are of a level equal to or greater than that of the original caster. All these effects occur without regard to the caster's wishes. Spell effects on the person of the caster, or effects or items being carried or worn by the caster, remain undisturbed, but any others within the area are affected, including those of allies. The opening of locks or other closures triggers any alarms or traps attached to them. Any released creature might or might not be friendly to the caster. Material Components: A lodestone and a pinch of saltpeter.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undead Bane Weapon.MOD				DESC:You give a weapon the undead bane special ability in addition to any other properties it has. Against undead, your weapon's enhancement bonus is 2 higher than normal, and it deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against undead. The spell has no effect if cast upon a weapon that already has the undead bane special ability. Alternatively, you can affect up to fifty arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together, such as in the same quiver. Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after one attack. The weapon is treated as goodaligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undead Lieutenant.MOD				DESC:You empower the subject undead with the authority of command over undead in your control. The targeted undead must have Intelligence 5 or higher. Undead under your control obey the target undead as if it were you. You can give orders to the undead normally, superseding the orders of the subject of this spell. The number of undead you can control is increased by an amount equal to your caster level as long as the undead lieutenant is active. If the target undead creature is destroyed, the spell ends. You can have only one undead lieutenant at any time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undead Torch.MOD					DESC:The subject creature deals an extra 2d6 points of damage on melee attacks against living creatures. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the undead subject attacks it. If your caster level check fails, the creature is unaffected by that casting of the undead torch. If the undead creature is destroyed, the undead torch continues to burn at the location of its destruction until the duration ends, and living creatures that pass through that area take 2d6 points of damage. If the undead creature assumes a nonphysical state (such as a vampire assuming gaseous form), the spell disperses harmlessly. Material Component: A living or dead firefly or glowworm.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undeath's Eternal Foe.MOD			DESC:You grant one or more creatures special abilities that allow them to effectively destroy undead. All subjects receive a death ward effect (PH 217). The subjects also have immunity to the special attacks and abilities of undead that deal ability damage, ability drain, fear effects, disease, paralysis, or poison. Targets can make melee and ranged attacks against ethereal or incorporeal undead as if they were using ghost touch weapons. They also gain a +4 sacred bonus to AC against attacks by undead.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undermaster.MOD					DESC:You take up the mantle of the earth, gaining power over it as long as you stand upon or beneath its surface. While energized with the awesome power of this spell, you can choose a spell from those listed below once per round and use it as a spelllike ability. Using a spell in this way requires a standard action, even if the spell would normally have a longer casting time (such as move earth). The spells granted by undermaster are earth lock, earthquake, excavate, flesh to stone, meld into stone, move earth, reverse gravity, soften earth and stone, statue, stone shape, stone tell, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, tunnel swallow, wall of stone, and xorn movement. Material Component: A deep blue spinel worth 500 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Undersong.MOD					DESC:This spell brings to your mind a song that helps you retain your concentration. The song does not distract you from any task at hand-on the contrary, by humming along to the tune, you can focus your mind with ease. As long as this spell is in effect, you can make a Perform check in place of a Concentration check.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Unholy Storm.MOD					DESC:A driving rain falls around you. It falls in a fixed area once created. The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks. It also applies a -4 penalty on ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm. Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50%% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns). The rain damages good creatures, dealing 2d6 points of damage per round (good outsiders take double damage). Material Component: A flask of unholy water (25 gp).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Unluck.MOD						DESC:When you cast this spell, you negatively influence the randomness of fortune for the target. Whenever the affected creature undertakes an action involving random chance (specifically, whenever any die roll is made for the creature, including attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws), two separate rolls are made and the worse result applied. A creature carrying a stone of good luck is immune to the effect of unluck. Material Component: A piece of a broken mirror.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Unyielding Roots.MOD				DESC:The creature you touch must be standing on or otherwise touching the ground for this spell to have an effect on it. For the duration of the spell, the touched creature can't move from its current space, nor can it be moved from its space by bull rushes, overruns, magic such as Bigby's forceful hand, or any effect short of a massive earthquake. Such attempts simply fail. If an overrun attempt is made against a creature with unyielding roots, the rooted creature must block rather than avoid the overrun. The rooted creature automatically wins the Strength check to stop the overrun and can make a Strength check (opposed by the overrunning creature's Strength or Dexterity check) to knock the overrunning creature prone. The roots draw life energy from the ground that feed the touched creature, healing up to 30 points of damage per round, neutralizing poisons automatically, and wiping away negative levels (as the restoration spell). The touched creature gets a +4 bonus on Fortitude and Will saves as long as the roots remain, but a -4 penalty on Reflex saves.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Updraft.MOD						DESC:Updraft conjures forth rushing air that propels you upward. You gain 10 feet per level of altitude, and then gently float back down to the ground. At any point during your descent, you can move up to 5 feet laterally. Material Component: A miniature propeller or windmill.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Valiant Fury.MOD					DESC:The affected creature gains a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, when making a full attack, the affected creature can make one additional attack with any weapon it is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by the haste spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Veil of Shadow.MOD				DESC:Swirling wisps of darkness obscure your form, granting you concealment. The 20%% miss chance is in effect even if the attacker has darkvision. This spell effect is dispelled in daylight or in the area of a light spell of 3rd level or higher. See invisibility does not counter a veil of shadow's concealment effect, but a true seeing spell does.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Veil of Undeath.MOD				DESC:You gain many of the traits common to undead creatures. While the spell lasts, you have immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death, extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, death from massive damage, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, damage to physical ability scores, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it is harmless or affects objects. You need not breathe, eat, or sleep. Like an undead creature, you are damaged by cure spells and healed by inflict spells. You don't actually gain the undead type from casting this spell. Material Component: A finger from a zombie.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vigor.MOD						DESC:This spell functions like lesser vigor, except as noted here and that it grants fast healing 2.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

Vigor (Lesser).MOD				DESC:The subject gains fast healing 1, enabling it to heal 1 hit point per round until the spell ends and automatically becoming stabilized if it begins dying from hit point loss during that time. Lesser vigor does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow or attach lost body parts. The effects of multiple vigor spells do not stack; only the highest-level effect applies.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vigor (Mass Lesser).MOD				DESC:This spell functions like lesser vigor, except that it affects multiple creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vigorous Circle.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like mass lesser vigor, except as noted here and that it grants fast healing 3.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vile Death.MOD					DESC:You summon the spirit of a fiend from the depths of the Nine Hells or the Abyss and bind it into the body of a corporeal undead creature-either a bodak, devourer, ghast, ghoul, mohrg, mummy, nightshade, skeleton, vampire, vampire spawn, wight, or zombie. Binding the fiend applies the fiendish template (MM 108) to the undead creature. The resulting creature is independent of you, and can act on its own. Its initial attitude toward you is indifferent. Material Component: A bit of brimstone and a bloodstone worth at least 500 gp. XP Cost: 100 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vine Mine.MOD					DESC:You create and direct the rapid growth of vines. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following effects. . Climbing aid (treat as knotted ropes) . Bind helpless targets (Escape Artist DC 25 to escape) . Hamper movement (as heavy undergrowth) . Camouflage (add +4 competence bonus on Hide checks) As a standard action, you can redirect the vines' growth (thus changing the effect). Material Component: A crown of ivy leaves.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vine Strike.MOD					DESC:While this spell is in effect, you have a special connection to the forces of nature that allows you to deliver sneak attacks on plant creatures as if they were not immune to sneak attacks. To attack a plant creature in this manner, you must still meet the other requirements for making a sneak attack. This spell applies only to sneak attack damage. It gives you no ability to affect plant creatures with critical hits, nor does it confer any special ability to overcome the damage reduction or other defenses of plant creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vipergout.MOD					DESC:This spell summons 1d4+1 celestial or fiendish Medium vipers (MM 280), which leap forth from your mouth to attack your enemies. A celestial viper summoned by this spell has resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance 7; and a smite evil attack that provides a +2 bonus on one damage roll. A fiendish viper summoned by this spell has resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance 7; and a smite good attack that provides a +2 bonus on one damage roll. Starting in the round you complete the spell, you can spit three vipers as a standard action or one viper as a move action. (Thus, if you move and then cast this spell, you cannot spit any vipers until your next turn, but if you cast this spell without moving, you can spit forth one viper as your move action in that round.) Spat vipers land at your feet in an adjacent square of your choice and act on the same round, on your turn, just as creatures summoned by a summon monster spell do. The snakes are not actually present in your mouth, and they do not interfere with your breathing. However, until you have brought forth all the snakes summoned by the spell, you cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, or activate items that require speech. When the spell's duration expires, all the vipers disappear, and any not yet brought forth are lost. When you use a summoning spell to summon a good creature or an evil creature, it is a spell of that type. Material Component: A snakeskin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Visage of the Deity.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like lesser visage of the deity, except that you take on many qualities of a celestial or fiendish creature, as follows. . You take on a shining, metallic appearance (for good clerics) or a more fearsome appearance (for evil clerics). .

Visage of the Deity (Greater).MOD		DESC:This spell functions like lesser visage of the deity, except that you take on many qualities of a half-celestial or half-fiendish creature. Your creature type changes to outsider for the duration of the spell. Unlike other outsiders, you can be brought back from the dead if you are killed in this form. Good clerics undergo the following transformations. . You grow feathered wings that allow you to fly at twice your normal speed (good maneuverability). . You gain +1 natural armor. . You gain low-light vision. . You gain resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10. . You gain immunity to disease. . You gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. .

Visage of the Deity (Lesser).MOD		DESC:You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. You also gain resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and electricity 10 if you are good, or resistance to cold 10 and fire 10 if you are evil.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Viscid Glob.MOD					DESC:When you attack with a viscid glob, you make a ranged touch attack against the target. If you miss, the glob might strike a nearby square or creature (see Missing with a Thrown Weapon, PH 158). Once you have established the direction of the miss, roll 1d4 to determine the number of squares away from the target square that the glob lands. A Medium or smaller creature struck by the glob must make a successful Reflex save or be instantly stuck in place. A stuck creature can speak but is otherwise limited to purely mental actions (such as casting spells with no somatic or material components) and attempts to free itself by means of a Strength check or Escape Artist check (against a DC equal to this spell's DC) made as a full-round action. A Large or larger creature stuck in the goo can't move from the spot where it is glued, but it can otherwise act normally. The glob dissipates when the spell duration expires. Until then, it remains sticky, and any creature touching it (for example, a creature attempting to pull out an ally) must make a successful Reflex save or become stuck itself. A creature stuck by such secondary contact is not trapped as thoroughly as a creature targeted by the glob, however, so the DC of the Strength check or Escape Artist check required to get free is reduced by 5. Material Component: A tiny ball of spider silk.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vision of Glory.MOD				DESC:You give the subject creature a brief vision of a divine entity that is giving it support and inspiring it to continue. The creature gets a morale bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on a single saving throw. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies. Using the bonus discharges the spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vitriolic Sphere.MOD				DESC:Affected creatures take 6d6 points of acid damage. Creatures that succeed on their Reflex saving throws take half of this damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves take full damage, and also take 6d6 points of acid damage in each of the following 2 rounds. Material Component: A tiny glass vial filled with aqua regia.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Voice of the Dragon.MOD				DESC:You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. You also gain the ability to speak and understand (but not read) Draconic. At any time before the spell's duration expires, you can use a standard action to target a creature with a suggestion effect, which functions identically to the spell of that name (PH 285), including range, duration, and other effects. Doing this causes the voice of the dragon spell to end, though the suggestion itself lasts for the normal duration thereafter. Special: Sorcerers cast this spell at +1 caster level.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vortex of Teeth.MOD				DESC:Creatures in the area take 3d8 points of damage per round at the beginning of your turn. Because this spell is a force effect, it harms incorporeal creatures. Material Component: A fish tooth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Vulnerability.MOD					DESC:This spell lowers the subject's damage reduction by 5 (to a minimum of 5). For instance, if you successfully cast vulnerability on a dragon with damage reduction 10/magic, its damage reduction becomes 5/magic. For every four caster levels beyond 9th, the subject's damage reduction lowers by an additional 5: a reduction of 10 at caster level 15th and a reduction of 15 at caster level 19th.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wail of Doom.MOD					DESC:Anyone caught in the area of this spell suffers excruciating pain and becomes demoralized. Each creature takes 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4) and becomes panicked for 1 round per caster level. A successful Will save halves the damage, reduces the panicked effect to shaken, and reduces the duration of the shaken effect to 1 round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Chaos.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like wall of good (see below), except that lawful creatures are blocked.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Dispel Magic.MOD			DESC:This spell creates a transparent, permeable barrier. Anyone passing through it becomes the target of a dispel magic effect (PH 223) at your caster level. A summoned creature targeted in this way can be dispelled by the effect. A wall of dispel magic cannot be seen or felt by ordinary means, or even with a see invisibility spell. Detect magic indicates the presence of the effect, and true seeing reveals its presence.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Evil.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like wall of good (see below), except that good creatures are blocked.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Gears.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a 6-inch-thick wall of moving iron cogs, wheels, gears, pistons, and assorted mechanical parts. Each 5-foot square of the wall's surface has hardness 10 and 90 hit points. Both sides of the wall have hundreds of moving parts that flail out, dealing 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 15d6) to all creatures within 10 feet. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. Material Component: A small gear.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Gloom.MOD					DESC:You create a barrier of ominous shadow that obscures vision and blocks line of sight, including darkvision. The wall is insubstantial, so creatures can move through it without penalty. Wall of gloom counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower level. Material Component: A bit of fleece from a black sheep.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Good.MOD					DESC:You create an immobile barrier that inhibits evil creatures. An evil summoned creature cannot pass through the wall in either direction, and any other evil creature must succeed on a Will save each time it attempts to move through the wall. If the saving throw is failed, the creature's movement is stopped, and it can take no other action that round. A wall of good must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If it is cast so that an object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails. Arcane Material Component: Powdered silver worth 25 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Greater Dispel Magic.MOD		DESC:This spell functions like wall of dispel magic (see above), except that the effect is that of greater dispel magic (PH 223).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Law.MOD					DESC:This spell functions like wall of good (see above), except that chaotic creatures are blocked.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Light.MOD					DESC:This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into being at any point within range. The wall is opaque to all other creatures, though you can see through it without difficulty. A wall of light has no physical substance and does not otherwise hinder attacks, movement, or spells passing through it, although it blocks line of sight for other creatures. A creature that passes through a wall of light becomes dazzled for the duration of the spell. Spell resistance applies when passing through the wall. Sightless creatures and those already dazzled are not affected by passing through a wall of light. A wall of light sheds light equivalent to a daylight spell. Wall of light counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level. Material Component: A pinch of powdered sunstone.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Limbs.MOD					DESC:An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling limbs springs into existence. The limbs resemble your own forelimbs. A creature attempting to move through the wall takes 5d6 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or become stuck within the wall and unable to move (a charging creature gains a +2 bonus on the Strength check). The creature takes 5d6 points of damage each round at the beginning of your turn until freed. A creature can free itself with a DC 18 Strength check, or by dealing 30 points of damage to a 5-foot section of wall. A creature that starts its turn next to a wall of limbs must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be grabbed by the flailing arms and become stuck, as above. If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save. A wall of limbs provides cover against attacks made through it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Sand.MOD					DESC:This spell conjures up a 10-foot-thick, viscous, opaque wall of swirling sand. The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10. Creatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (DMG 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Creatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located. Any open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished. Arcane Material Component: A handful of sand.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Smoke.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a thin wall of black smoke. The wall is stationary once created. The wall blocks sight to a limited degree. Creatures on opposite sides of the wall that cannot see over it gain concealment from each other. A creature can pass through a wall of smoke, but it must make a Fortitude save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, destroys the wall in 1 round. This spell does not function underwater.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wall of Water.MOD					DESC:This spell creates a 10-foot-thick wall of fresh water or seawater (as selected by you). The water forms around objects and creatures in its area, plunging these creatures and objects underwater. A creature in the area where the water is created can make a Reflex save to move to a random side of the wall before it forms completely. This movement must occur on the creature's next turn, or it immediately suffers the full effect of being in the wall. Creatures can move through a wall of water by making Swim checks, or can walk along the floor at half speed; the water itself is considered to be calm water. Any open flames in the area when the water forms are immediately extinguished. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level each round they remain partially or wholly in the wall. Although the wall is transparent, it provides cover to any targets inside against attacks launched from outside the wall. It cannot be destroyed by physical damage, nor can it be drained off to a different location. Water brought out of the wall in a container instantly evaporates as the wall itself forms more water to replace what was removed. Material Component: A sponge.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
War Cry.MOD						DESC:You gain a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made as part of a charge. If you deal damage with a charge attack, your foe must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 1 round (spell resistance applies to this effect).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Warning Shout.MOD					DESC:All allies within range are no longer considered flat-footed, even if they have not yet acted in the current combat. Anyone sleeping naturally (as opposed to magically induced sleep, such as from a sleep spell) within the area is woken by a warning shout.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Waterspout.MOD					DESC:Waterspout causes water to rise up into a whirling, cylindrical column. You can direct the movement of the waterspout as a move action. A waterspout moves at a speed of 30 feet. You can concentrate on controlling the waterspout's every movement or specify a simple program, such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like. Directing a waterspout's movement or changing its programmed movement is a move action for you. A waterspout always moves during your turn in the initiative order. If the waterspout exceeds the spell's range, it collapses and the spell ends. A waterspout batters creatures and objects it touches, and it often sucks them up. Any creature or object that comes in contact with it must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d8 points of damage. Medium or smaller creatures that fail their saves are sucked into the spout and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 2d6 points of damage each round (no save). Trapped creatures remain inside for 1d3 rounds before the waterspout ejects them out the top of the spout, and they fall back to the surface (taking 8d6 points of falling damage) 1d8?5 feet from the base of the waterspout. Waterborne creatures or objects within 10 feet of the spout (below and on all sides) also must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked into the spout if they are Medium or smaller. Anything sucked into the spout takes 3d8 points of damage and is then trapped for 1d3 rounds as described above. Only the smallest of watercraft, such as canoes, kayaks, or coracles, can be sucked into the spout. The occupant of any such craft can make a Profession (sailor) check instead of a Reflex save if it so chooses to avoid being sucked up.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wave of Grief.MOD					DESC:All within the cone when the spell is cast take a -3 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. Material Component: Three tears.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weapon of Energy.MOD				DESC:You cause a weapon to gain the ability to deal energy damage in addition to its other abilities, similar to how a flaming burst weapon deals extra fire damage on a hit or a critical hit. The weapon can deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, chosen by you at the time of casting. The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of that energy type on a successful hit. On a critical hit, the weapon deals an additional 1d10 points of energy damage. If the weapon's critical multiplier is ?3, add 2d10 points of energy damage instead, and if the multiplier is ?4, add 3d10 points of energy damage. This spell can be cast on a weapon that already deals energy damage, and if the weapon already creates the same type of damage as the spell, the effects stack. For example, if cast on a +1 flaming longsword to give it additional fire damage, the weapon now deals an extra 2d6 points of fire damage per hit. This spell has a descriptor that is the same as the energy created by the target weapon. For example, weapon of energy is a fire spell when used to give a weapon bonus fire damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weapon of Impact.MOD				DESC:This spell makes a bludgeoning weapon have greater impact, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. If the spell is cast on sling bullets or other bludgeoning projectiles, the weapon of impact effect on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range, such as the Improved Critical feat, don't stack.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weapon of the Deity.MOD				DESC:You must be holding your deity's favored weapon to cast this spell. You can use the weapon as if you had profi- ciency with it even if you normally do not. The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls and an additional special ability (see the list below). A double weapon gains this enhancement bonus and special ability for only one of its two ends, as chosen by you. When you reach caster level 9th, the enhancement bonus of the weapon increases to +2. At 12th level, the bonus rises to +3, at 15th level it is +4, and at 18th level it becomes +5. The list below includes deities from the core pantheon as well as other deities described in D&amp;D supplements, along with the five alignment components. If a cleric worshiping a different deity casts this spell, the DM should assign an appropriate weapon special ability of the same power level as those given here. Deities Bahamut: +1 frost heavy pick Boccob: +1 spell storing quarterstaff Corellon Larethian: +1 keen longsword Ehlonna: +1 frost longsword Erythnul: +1 mighty cleaving morningstar Fharlanghn: +1 defending quarterstaff Garl Glittergold: +1 throwing battleaxe Gruumsh: +1 returning shortspear Heironeous: +1 shock longsword Hextor: +1 mighty cleaving heavy flail Kord: +1 mighty cleaving greatsword Kurtulmak: +1 shock shortspear Lolth: +1 keen whip Moradin: +1 throwing warhammer Nerull: +1 keen scythe Obad-Hai: +1 defending quarterstaff Olidammara: +1 keen rapier Pelor: +1 flaming heavy mace St. Cuthbert: +1 mighty cleaving heavy mace Vecna: +1 frost dagger Wee Jas: dagger of venom Tiamat: +1 flaming heavy pick Yondalla: +1 defending short sword Alignments Good: +1 frost warhammer Evil: +1 mighty cleaving light flail Neutral: +1 defending heavy mace Law: +1 flaming longsword Chaos: +1 shock battleaxe|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weapon Shift.MOD					DESC:A weapon shift spell allows you to temporarily transform any one melee weapon into a different melee weapon. Thus, a greatclub could be transformed into a greatsword, a light pick into a morning star, or a dagger into a battleaxe. Improvised weapons and double weapons cannot be targeted or be the result of this spell. Magic weapons transformed retain all their special abilities as long as the new form could legally have those abilities, and weapons made from special materials retain their special materials. Material Component: A piece of parchment folded into the shape of the weapon type desired.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weather Eye.MOD					DESC:You can accurately predict the natural weather up to one week into the future. If unnatural forces currently affect the weather, then weather eye reveals the spells or abilities in effect, though not the source of those abilities. Material Component: Incense. Focus: A scrying device of some kind (bowl, mirror, crystal ball, and so forth).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Weighed in the Balance.MOD			DESC:This spell harms or heals creatures within its area based on their alignments and life status. The effect does the most harm to those creatures most extreme in alignment and most out of balance with the natural world. For living creatures that have an alignment with no neutral component (LG, CG, LE, or CE), this spell acts as an inflict critical wounds spell (PH 244). For living creatures that have an alignment with a neutral component and one other (NG, LN, CN, or NE), this spell acts as an inflict moderate wounds spell (PH 244). For living creatures that have a neutral alignment (N) and all undead creatures, this spell acts as a heal spell (PH 239), dealing damage to undead but acting as a beneficial spell to neutral creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Whirling Blade.MOD				DESC:You hurl a weapon held at the time of casting, and it magically attacks all enemies along a line to the extent of the spell's range. You make a normal melee attack, just as if you were attacking with the weapon in melee, against each foe in the weapon's path, but you can choose to substitute your Intelligence modifier or your Charisma modifier (as appropriate for your spellcasting class) for your Strength modifier on the weapon's attack rolls and damage rolls. Even if your base attack bonus would normally give you multiple attacks, a whirling blade gets only one attack (at your best attack bonus) against each target. The weapon deals damage just as if you had swung it in melee, including any bonuses you might have from ability scores or feats. No matter how many targets your weapon hits or misses, it instantly and unerringly returns to your hand after attempting the last of its attacks. Focus: A slashing melee weapon that you hurl.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Whirlwind (Greater).MOD				DESC:This spell is a more potent version of whirlwind (PH 301). A greater whirlwind affects creatures differently, depending on their size and where they are in relation to the twister. Near the Tornado: Large or smaller creatures who start their turn within 60 feet of the center of a greater whirlwind must succeed on a Fortitude save or be dragged 1d4?10 feet toward the center of the twister, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet dragged. Huge creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures within 40 feet of the twister must succeed on a Fortitude save before moving away from the twister. Flying creatures of Huge size or smaller that fail their Fortitude saves are sucked to the center of the twister, taking 2d6 points of damage from the battering and buffeting. Gargantuan flying creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or be pulled 1d6?10 feet toward the center of the twister. Colossal flyers must likewise make Fortitude saves or be pulled 1d6?5 feet toward the twister's center. Any Huge or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Large or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds. Any creature picked up is ejected 3 rounds later. Inside the Tornado: Creatures that start their turn inside the tornado take 6d6 points of damage for each round they remain inside at the beginning of your turn. Creatures inside the tornado can't do much; attacks, spellcasting, and movement are impossible within a greater whirlwind. When the greater whirlwind ejects a creature, it reappears 4d6?5 feet away from the twister's center in a random direction, and 4d6?5 feet off the ground (immediately falling if it can't fly). Terrain and Structures: The tornado uproots trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of dense rubble (DMG 90) wherever it goes. Structures within a greater whirlwind take 2d6?10 points of damage per round. In a round or two, that amount of damage is sufficient to destroy any building made of materials less sturdy than reinforced masonry. No ranged attacks can pass through the twister. A greater whirlwind extinguishes all flames it touches. Listen checks are impossible within a greater whirlwind. A greater whirlwind remains stationary unless you direct it elsewhere as a move action. It moves up to 60 feet per round.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wild Runner.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a centaur (MM 32). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to monstrous humanoid, and your size changes to Large. You have the space and reach of a centaur (10 feet/5 feet). You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution of an average centaur (Str 18, Dex 14, Con 15), but you retain your own mental ability scores. Your base land speed becomes 50 feet. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You can still use any extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities possessed by your normal form. You gain all the advantages of a quadruped form (greater carrying capacity, +4 bonus to resist trip attacks, and so on); this includes the ability to fight effectively while carrying a rider. You can still use your equipment and cast spells normally.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wind at Back.MOD					DESC:This spell doubles the overland speed (PH 164) of all subjects, assuming they are all traveling together in the same direction, including pack animals and mounts. This spell does not affect nonliving material. The spell does not affect tactical speed.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wind Tunnel.MOD					DESC:You call on the wind to assist your allies' accuracy. A wind tunnel improves the accuracy of your allies' ranged weapons, granting each subject a +5 competence bonus on ranged attacks. Further, it doubles the range increment of these weapons.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wingbind.MOD					DESC:A web of force surrounds the target, entangling it like a net. This spell functions like earthbind (page 76), except that an ensnared creature immediately falls to the ground, taking falling damage. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check against a DC equal to the save DC of the spell. Like a wall of force (PH 298), this web of force is impervious to most attacks: It is immune to damage of all kinds, cannot be burst with a Strength check, and is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. Also like a wall of force, the web is immediately destroyed by disintegrate, a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or Mordenkainen's disjunction.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Winged Mount.MOD					DESC:This spell grants your special mount a fly speed of 60 feet (good). The mount is slowed as normal because of weight carried, barding worn, and environmental factors.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wings of Air.MOD					DESC:The creature you touch becomes more agile in the air, able to make quicker turns, and more maneuverable when flying. The subject must be capable of flight using wings. The creature's maneuverability improves by one grade-from clumsy to poor, poor to average, average to good, or good to perfect. A single creature cannot benefit from multiple applications of this spell at one time.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wings of Air (Greater).MOD			DESC:This spell functions like wings of air, except that the creature's maneuverability improves by two grades-from clumsy to average, poor to good, or average to perfect.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wings of the Sea.MOD				DESC:This spell increases the touched creature's swim speed by 30 feet. It has no effect on other modes of movement, nor does it give the subject a swim speed if it does not already have one. Material Component: A drop of water.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Winter Chill.MOD					DESC:The target creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of cold damage and become fatigued. A creature with immunity to cold is not affected by this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Winter's Embrace.MOD				DESC:A target that fails its save takes 1d8 points of cold damage per round at the beginning of your turn. Each round, the subject can make a new Fortitude saving throw to avoid taking damage that round. The second time a subject takes damage from a single casting of winter's embrace, it becomes fatigued. The fourth time it takes damage from the same spell, it becomes exhausted.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wither Limb.MOD					DESC:You choose to wither either the arms or the legs of a humanoid. Withered legs force a subject to fall prone while at the same time reducing the subject's land speed to 5 feet. Withered arms make it impossible for the subject to use objects or cast spells with somatic components. A withered limb can be restored to normal by a successful dispel magic from a spellcaster of a level higher than the level of the wither limb caster.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Withering Palm.MOD				DESC:Your successful melee touch attack deals 1 point of Strength damage and 1 point of Constitution damage per two caster levels to the target (maximum of 10 points each). If you score a critical hit, the subject takes ability drain instead, but the effect is not doubled.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wood Rot.MOD					DESC:When you cast this spell, an insidious rot immediately taints any wooden object or plant creature you touch. Any unattended nonmagical wooden item smaller than 6 feet in diameter, or a 3-foot-radius volume of a larger wooden object (such as a wooden door), is instantly destroyed by wood rot. In combat, you can use the spell to attempt to sunder any wooden or wooden-hafted weapon; the weapon or its wooden portion is destroyed on a successful melee touch attack. Attempting to sunder a weapon generally provokes attacks of opportunity, and wood rot has no effect on wooden or wooden-hafted weapons that strike you, even if you hold the charge. Against wooden shields or armor, you also make a melee touch attack. Such targets too large to be destroyed outright take a -1d6 penalty to their armor or shield bonus on a successful hit and are rendered unusable if the penalty exceeds the bonus. Any attack against a wooden object discharges the spell, and wooden magic items are immune to the effect of wood rot. Against plant creatures, wood rot deals 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15) on a successful attack. Against plant creatures, the spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round. Once it is used to make an attack against a plant creature, wood rot cannot be used to attack or destroy wooden items. Material Component: A live termite.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wood Wose.MOD					DESC:A wood wose is a translucent green nature spirit that you can command to perform simple natural tasks. It can build a campfire, gather herbs, feed an animal companion, catch a fish, or perform any other simple task that doesn't involve knowledge of technology. It cannot, for example, open a latched chest, since it doesn't know how a latch works. A wood wose can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity if told to do so. Thus, if you commanded it to gather leaves, it would continue to do so while you turned your attention elsewhere, as long as you remained within range. A wood wose has an effective Strength of 2, so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds. It can trigger traps, but the 20 pounds of force it can exert is not enough to activate most pressure plates. It has a land speed of 15 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet (perfect). A wood wose cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll or a saving throw. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. If you attempt to send the wose beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Word of Balance.MOD				DESC:Any lawful good, chaotic good, lawful evil, or chaotic evil creature that hears a word of balance suffers ill effects according to its Hit Dice, as given below, with no saving throw. These effects are cumulative. HD Effect Equal to caster level Nauseated Up to caster level -1 Weakened, nauseated Up to caster level -5 Paralyzed, weakened, nauseated Up to caster level -10 Killed Nauseated: The creature is limited to a single move action for 1 round but can defend itself normally. Weakened: The creature's Strength decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Killed: The creature dies if living or is destroyed if undead. If you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, every lawful good, chaotic good, lawful evil, and chaotic evil elemental and outsider within the area is instantly banished back to its home plane unless it makes a successful Will saving throw at a -4 penalty. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. The banishment effect occurs whether or not the creatures actually hear the word of balance, though those that do also suffer the appropriate effects (see above). Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by word of balance.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Word of Binding.MOD				DESC:You create masterwork steel manacles that attempt to bind your target. A successful Reflex save allows the target to dodge the forming manacles; otherwise it is bound at its wrists and ankles. The imprisoned creature can slip free with a DC 35 Escape Artist check or a DC 28 Strength check. The manacles have hardness 10 and hit points equal to 10 + 1 per caster level. The manacles automatically scale to fit any Medium or smaller humanoid creature. While imprisoned by the manacles, the subject cannot take any actions requiring the use of its hands and can move only 5 feet per round. The manacles come complete with an average quality lock (Open Lock DC 25).|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wounding Whispers.MOD				DESC:Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon takes 1d6 points of sonic damage +1 point per caster level. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage. Weapons with reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. You cannot use this spell to deal damage to another target (for instance, with an unarmed attack or by forcing the whispers against a target). Only if another creature touches you does the effect deal damage.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wrack.MOD						DESC:This spell causes your target to experience excruciating pain. For the duration of the spell, the subject falls prone and is blinded and helpless. Even when the spell ends, the subject is still shaken for 3d10 minutes.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wracking Touch.MOD				DESC:You lay your hand upon a creature and deal 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10). In addition, if you have the sneak attack ability, you also deal sneak attack damage to the affected creature unless the creature is immune to extra damage from critical hits. The creature still takes the spell damage even if it does not take the sneak attack damage. Unlike a normal use of sneak attack, your target need not be flanked or denied its Dexterity bonus to take sneak attack damage from this spell.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wraithstrike.MOD					DESC:While this spell is in effect, your melee attacks are resolved as melee touch attacks rather than normal melee attacks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Wrathful Castigation.MOD			DESC:This spell causes wracking pain and violent convulsions, ending in death. The target creature must make a Will save or writhe in pain, helpless, before it dies 1 round later at the start of your turn. A creature that makes the Will save must also succeed on a second Will save or be dazed and take a -4 penalty on saving throws for the duration of the spell. Focus: A whip.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Xorn Movement.MOD					DESC:The subject of this spell can move through natural earth and stone (but not worked stone, brick, or metal) as a xorn does, leaving behind no tunnel or sign of passage. Furthermore, the subject can breathe normally while entombed in earth and natural rock. A move earth spell cast on an area the subject occupies flings it back 30 feet and stuns it for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the stunning effect. Xorn movement lasts a minimum of 1 round/level. If the subject has not emerged into a large enough open space to contain its body comfortably when the spell expires, it is shunted off to the nearest such open space, taking 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. Focus: A scale from a xorn's hide.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Zeal.MOD						DESC:Choose a foe as you cast this spell. You gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against all attacks of opportunity from opponents other than the chosen foe. Also, you can move through enemies as if they were allies for the duration of this spell, as long as you finish your movement closer to your chosen foe than when you began it.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Zealot Pact.MOD					DESC:Once this spell is cast, the zealot pact remains dormant until the subject successfully hits a foe whose alignment is exactly opposite that of your deity. The subject's subsequent melee attacks gain a +4 bonus and deal double damage. Once the spell is active, the subject must attack foes of opposite alignment every round if able to do so, or the spell effect ends. The subject knows which creatures within 60 feet are of opposite alignment. If you create a zealot pact with a neutral deity (such as Obad-Hai), choose one alignment from among the following that triggers the zealot pact: lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic evil, or -chaotic good. A creature can be subject to only one zealot pact at a time. Casting zealot pact on a subject that already has an untriggered zealot pact voids the earlier pact. XP Cost: 500 XP.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Zone of Respite.MOD				DESC:Smearing blood between your fingers, you inscribe a ward in the air and cast the power of that ward over a wide area.  You create a region that is temporarily protected against interplanar inrusion.  This includes spells and abilities that use other planes, including dimension door, teleport, plane shift, and travel through such planes as the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.  Summoning and calling spells do not function within a zone of respite, but existing portals are unaffected by the spell.  Creatures on coterminous or coexistent plans (DMG 150) must retreat to the edge of the zone of respite and cannot enter the corresponding area on the coterminous or coexistent plane.  Material Component: A small amount of blood from a gorgon.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Zone of Revelation.MOD				DESC:All creatures and objects within a zone of revelation are made visible. This includes invisible creatures, as well as those on coexistent planes such as the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow (DMG 150). Natives of these planes do not lose any abilities but are simply made visible. Zone of revelation suppresses but does not dispel invisibility, etherealness, or other spells. Once a formerly invisible object or creature leaves the area, it becomes invisible again. Ethereal creatures in the spell's area become nonethereal until they move beyond the spell's range. Arcane Material Component: A handful of dust from the grave clothes of an undead creature.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
