# Warforged
Composite Plating		KEY:Warforged ~ Composite Plating						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warforged Race Trait.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The plating used to build a warforged provides a +2 armor bonus. This plating is not natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same space on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus a warforged cannot wear armor or magic robes. A warforged can be enchanted just as armor can be. The creature must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant him. Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5%% arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for wearing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged to ignore the arcane spell failure chance for light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.
