Aura: Strong; (DC 25) transmutation
Activation: Standard (command)
Weight: 15 lb.
A riot of red, yellow, and orange leaves has
been sewn together into a rigid suit of
armor resembling a breastplate.
This suit of armor functions as a +1 wild
breastplate if you are neutral good, lawful
neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral
evil. Because it is nonmetallic, wearing
this armor does not violate a druid’s
spiritual oaths, though it has the durability
of steel.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, once per
day you can cause the leaves of the armor
to turn brown and scatter on the breeze.
During this process, you merge with the
fallen leaves and disappear. Though the
leaves appear to flutter near the ground,
they are actually under your disembodied
control. While in this state, you can move
and interact with your environment as
if you were under the effect of a gaseous
form spell. This effect lasts for up to 30
minutes or until you use a standard action
to end it.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Obad-Hai and either sacrifi ce a
4th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 7 HD. If you sacrifi
ce a 6th-level divine slot (or have the True
Believer feat and at least 11 HD), you can
use the relic power two times per day.
Lore: The fi rst suit of armor of the fallen
leaves was sewn together by Ehlonna and
presented as a gift to Obad-Hai (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, Sanctify Relic, baleful polymorph,

were primary natural weapons. Alternatively,
you can use a single claw to make an

Weight: 70 lb.
At fi rst glance, this suit of full plate looks fi lthy
and ill kept. On closer examination, you can
see it is expertly crafted, and what appears to
be dirt is actually the color of the metal itself. A
black crystal shard is set horizontally into the
front of the armor across the abdomen. Runes
in the Gnome language mark its greaves and
gauntlets, and the aroma of fresh earth seems
to emanate from the suit.
A suit of earthplate armor functions as +1

armor, you can activate a stoneskin effect,
as the stoneskin spell. As long as this effect

is active, you can make a melee touch
attack to deal 5d6 points of electricity
damage. If underwater, you can produce

Activation: Standard (command)
Weight: 15 lb.
This fi nely crafted shield is engraved with the
image of a holy warrior healing a wounded
beggar.
A shield of mercy functions as a +1 heavy
steel shield and also allows you to channel
your destructive power into healing. You
can expend a smite attempt (such as from
a paladin’s smite evil class feature or the
granted power of the Destruction domain)
to heal a creature by touch. The touched
creature is healed of a number of points of
damage equal to the extra damage that you
would have dealt with the smite attack.
For example, a 10th-level paladin could
expend one use of her smite evil ability
to heal 10 points of damage.
If you also wear a magic item that
grants an enhancement bonus to your
Wisdom score, you add the item’s bonus
to the amount of damage healed by the
shield of mercy. For example, if the 10thlevel
paladin described above also wore
a periapt of Wisdom +2, each use of smite
evil she expended would heal 12 points
of damage.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, cure moderate wounds, owl’s

CHAPTER 1
ARMOR
Despite its motley appearance, a shield of
the resolute is a bulwark of defense. It functions
as a +1 light fortifi cation heavy mithral
shield, provided that you are lawful good,
neutral good, or lawful neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, a shield of the
resolute terrorizes enemies of the dwarves.
Every goblinoid and giant within 30 feet
of you that gazes upon the shield must
succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be shaken
(if its Hit Dice are equal to or greater
than yours) or frightened (if it has fewer
Hit Dice than you do) for 2 rounds. This
effect functions like a gaze attack, so the
saves must be made at the beginning of
each affected creature’s turn every round,
unless it takes measures to avoid seeing
the shield (see DMG 294 for gaze attack
rules). Unlike with a true gaze attack, you
can’t use a standard action on your turn
to use this effect against a creature. Once
a creature has failed the save, the shield’s
power has no further effect on that creature
for 24 hours.
To use the relic power, you must
worship Moradin and either sacrifi ce a
6th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 11 HD.
Lore: Shields of the resolute are said to
be assembled from pieces of the shields
carried by dwarves who fell in battle
defending their homelands. When the
Soul Forger gathers their souls, he creates
these shields in his forge in remembrance
of their valor (Knowledge [religion]
DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Activation: Immediate (command)
Weight: 10 lb.
This heavy wooden shield is emblazoned
with a gory handprint and decorated with
bloody symbols. The bloody marks appear
fresh and wet.
This gory item is favored by orcs for its
shock value to enemies, as well as for its
special properties. A shield of the severed
hand functions as a +2 heavy wooden shield
if you are chaotic evil, chaotic neutral,
or neutral evil.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection,
you can activate this shield to make
an immediate bull rush attempt
(with a +4 bonus on the Strength
check) against an adjacent opponent
that has just attacked you in
melee. This action does not provoke an
attack of opportunity from that opponent.
You can’t fall prone during this attempt,
and you can’t follow the opponent if you
push it back.
To use the relic power, you must
worship Gruumsh and either sacrifi ce
a 4th-level divine spell slot or have the
True Believer feat and at least 7 HD.
Lore: The original shield of the severed
hand was created when an orc warrior
chopped off the hand of an elf king
and mounted it on his shield. Upon the
warrior’s death, the shield was placed on
his blazing funeral pyre. Afterward, it was
found intact amid the ashes, still bearing
the palm print of its grisly burden (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).

Illus. by D. Kovacs
sking a warrior to enter battle without his most trusted
blade is like asking him to give up his right arm. A
sturdy suit of armor might keep a fi ghter or barbarian
alive, but without a good weapon in his hand, he can’t
win the battle.
This chapter collects over 100 special
weapon properties, plus dozens of specifi c
magic weapons, each constructed with a particular
array of useful properties.
Special Materials: Five percent of weapons
are made of unusual materials, such as
adamantine, cold iron, or alchemical silver.
Each of these special materials allows the weapon to overcome
the damage reduction of certain creatures. Table 2–1 summarizes
the additional effects of the most common special materials used
in weapons; see Special Materials, DMG 283, for more details.
Adamantine weapons are automatically of masterwork quality,
and this cost is included in the weapon cost.
Hardness and Hit Points: Each +1 of enhancement bonus
adds 1 to a weapon’s hardness and 1 to its hit points. Only the weapon’s
actual enhancement bonus applies; special properties with an
enhancement bonus equivalent for the purpose
of determining market price don’t increase the
hardness or hit points of a weapon.
Weapon Subtypes: Some weapon entries
have a subtype, either “synergy” or “relic,” in
brackets following the entry’s name. A synergy
item has a synergy prerequisite, typically
an existing special property already imbued into the weapon
to be enhanced. A relic item has special effectiveness for a
character devoted to a particular deity. Additional rules for
creating and using these items appear in Chapter 6.
Table 2–1: Weapon Special Materials
Cost
Material Effect Modifier
Adamantine Ignore hardness of less than 20 +3,000 gp*
Cold iron Magical enhancements ×2 cost +2,000 gp
Silver, alchemical –1 damage +2 gp (ammunition)
+20 gp (light weapon)
+90 gp (one-handed weapon)
+180 gp (two-handed or double weapon)
*Includes 300 gp for masterwork component.

really angry offense.”

CHAPTER 2
WEAPONS
WEAPON
PROPERTIES
A weapon with a special property must
have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. You
can’t simply have a fl aming longsword—it
would have to be at least a +1 fl aming
longsword. A single weapon cannot have a
modifi ed bonus (enhancement bonus plus
property bonus equivalents) higher than
+10, nor can it have a market price (not
counting special materials or the price of
the masterwork weapon itself) of greater
than 200,000 gp (or 200,000 gp for each
end of a double weapon). For weapons
that exceed these limits, see Epic Level
Handbook.
Unless noted otherwise in the Property
entry, each special property in this
chapter can be added to any weapon.
Some properties can be applied only to a
particular category of weapons, and are so
noted. A few properties can be added only
to a smaller subset of a category (such as
projectile weapons); this fact is stated in
the item’s Property entry.
The items in this section are arranged
alphabetically.
ACIDIC BURST
[SYNERGY]
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 12th
Aura: Strong; (DC 21) conjuration
Activation: Standard (command) and
—
Synergy Prerequisite: Corrosive
The surface of this weapon is pitted and
worn.
An acidic burst weapon functions as a
corrosive weapon (see page 31).
In addition, the weapon automatically
showers an opponent with acid upon a
successful critical hit, dealing extra acid
damage as set out on the table below. This
acid does not harm you or any creature
other than the target. This is a continuous
effect and requires no activation. Even if
the weapon has not been activated to deal
the extra 1d6 points of acid damage that
comes from the corrosive property, the
weapon still deals its extra acid damage
on a successful critical hit.
Critical Extra
Multiplier Acid Damage
×2 1d10
×3 2d10
×4 3d10
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, Melf’s acid arrow.

AQUAN
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon

Activation: —
Water constantly drips from the tip of this
blue-green weapon. Its grip is inlaid with
mother-of-pearl in a wavelike design.
An aquan weapon automatically overcomes
the damage reduction of any creature
that has the fi re subtype. In addition, the
weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage
against such creatures.
An aquan weapon also bestows one
negative level on any creature that has
the fi re subtype and attempts to wield
it. The negative level remains as long as
the weapon is in hand and disappears
when the weapon is no longer held. This
negative level never results in actual level
loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way
(including restoration spells) while the
weapon is wielded.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, water subtype.
Cost to Create: Varies.
AQUATIC
Price: +2,000 gp
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 7th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) abjuration
Activation: —
This weapon has a silvery-blue tinge, like the
sheen of white scales in sunlight.
While wielding an aquatic weapon, you

otherwise apply to using the weapon
underwater (DMG 92), as though you were
affected by a freedom of movement spell.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armors, freedom of movement.
Cost to Create: 1,000 gp, 80 XP, 2 days.
ARCANE MIGHT
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Bows (not crossbows)

arcane spells through this bow to make
the arrows fi red from it more damaging.
As a swift action, you can sacrifi ce a prepared
arcane spell from memory (or an
unused spell slot if you are a spontaneous
arcane caster). Doing so grants a bonus
equal to the sacrifi ced spell’s level on the
next damage roll you make with the bow
that turn.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, greater magic weapon.
Cost to Create: Varies.
AURAN
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 7th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) evocation
Activation: —
Wind constantly whistles along the length of
this white-enameled weapon. Its grip is inlaid
with whorls of silver that resemble clouds.
An auran weapon automatically overcomes
the damage reduction of any creature
that has the earth subtype. In addition,
the weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of
damage against such creatures.
An auran weapon also bestows one
negative level on any creature that has
the earth subtype and attempts to wield
it. The negative level remains as long as
the weapon is in hand and disappears
when the weapon is no longer held. This
negative level never results in actual level
loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way
(including restoration spells) while the
weapon is wielded.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, air subtype.
Cost to Create: Varies.
BANISHING
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 13th
Aura: Strong; (DC 21) abjuration
Activation: Free (command)
29
CHAPTER 2
WEAPONS
A barely visible bead of light slowly traces the
outline of this weapon.
When you strike an extraplanar creature
of 26 Hit Dice or fewer while wielding a
weapon that has this property, you can
activate the weapon to banish that creature
back to its home plane (Will DC 20
negates). A creature so banished cannot
return for at least 24 hours. A creature that
succeeds on its save cannot be banished by
the same weapon for 24 hours.
If the creature struck has damage
reduction that requires a particular
weapon alignment or special material
to overcome, increase the save DC by
2 for each such property shared by the
weapon. For example, if you use a holy
banishing cold iron weapon against a
hezrou (damage reduction 10/good),
the save DC would increase by 2, while
against a marilith (damage reduction 10/
good and cold iron), the save DC would
increase by 4.
The banishing property can be activated
three times per day.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, banishment.
Cost to Create: Varies.
BERSERKER
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Two-handed melee weapon
Caster Level: 7th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) enchantment

Though tarnished and battered, this simple
weapon is incredibly durable, the scars of a
hundred battles marring its surface.
In your hands, a berserker weapon deals
an extra 1d8 points of damage on any successful
attack while you are raging.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, rage.
Cost to Create: Varies.
BINDING
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 10th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) abjuration
Activation: Swift (command)
This weapon has a length of chain looped decoratively
around its grip or head.
When you activate a binding weapon,
the next successful attack you make
with it before the end of your turn prevents
the target from using any form of
extradimensional travel, as the dimensional
anchor spell.
The binding property functions two
times per day, and the effect lasts for 10
minutes.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, dimensional anchor.
Cost to Create: Varies.
BLESSED
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) transmutation
Activation: — and swift (command)
This weapon has a faint glow emanating from
within it.
A blessed weapon is treated as goodaligned
for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction. This effect is continuous
and requires no activation.
In addition, three times per day you can
activate a blessed weapon to automatically
confi rm all critical threats against evil foes
for 1 round (as if the weapon were affected
by the bless weapon spell).
Other effects related to threatening or
confi rming critical hits (such as the keen

CHAPTER 2
WEAPONS
This weapon is semitransparent, almost as
though it were glass, but it is obviously of
sturdier make.
When activated, a blurstrike weapon
partially fades from view for 1 round,
appearing only as a faint outline (though
you, as the wielder, can see it normally).
When you attack, an activated blurstrike
weapon (along with your hand and arm)
appears to others as an amorphous blur,
preventing a foe from knowing exactly
where the blow is aimed. After you activate
this property, your opponent is considered
fl at-footed against the fi rst attack
you make with the blurstrike weapon in
the round when you activate it. Creatures
that don’t rely on sight for combat (such as
those with the blindsight special quality)
and creatures with uncanny dodge aren’t
treated as fl at-footed against this attack.
The blurstrike property functions ten
times per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

your body heat.
Whenever a bodyfeeder weapon you wield
scores a successful critical hit against a
living creature, you gain temporary hit
points equal to half the damage dealt
by the critical hit. These temporary hit
points last for up to 1 minute and don’t
stack with those from any other source,

Activation: Swift (command)
This weapon is broader, thicker, and darker in
color than a normal weapon of its type.
After a successful melee attack with a
brutal surge weapon, you can command
the weapon to initiate a bull rush attempt
against the target of the attack in addition
to dealing its normal damage. This attempt
does not provoke attacks of opportunity
and is resolved using your size, Strength,
and other relevant characteristics. If
you wield a brutal surge weapon in two
hands, you gain a +2 bonus on the opposed
Strength check.
If successful, the bull rush pushes
the affected creature back the greatest
possible distance allowed by the result
of the opposed check, but you do not
move along with the target. Movement
caused by this bull rush attempt provokes
attacks of opportunity from other creatures
normally, but you cannot make an
attack of opportunity against the affected
creature.
The brutal surge property is usable a
number of times per day equal to 1 + your
Con bonus (if any). Once you activate this
property, it can’t be activated by any other

the weapon. In addition, the weapon’s
critical multiplier increases by 1 if the
target is a dragon. For example, a critical

Aura: Strong; (DC 21) conjuration
Activation: —
Synergy Prerequisite: Bane
Carved into the handle of this weapon is a
single rune in the Gnome language representing
the foe the weapon is dedicated to slaying.
A fi ercebane weapon excels at attacking
one type or subtype of creature. It acts
as a bane weapon against the creature
type (and subtype, if relevant) to which
its synergy prerequisite ability was attuned.
Whenever it strikes its designated
bane enemy, it begins to emit a low, eager
hum, as if it were actually feeding off the
victim’s life blood.
A fi ercebane weapon glows when a designated
foe comes within 60 feet, even if
you cannot see or detect it. In addition, the
weapon deals extra damage on every successful
critical hit. The amount depends
on its critical multiplier, as follows.
Critical Multiplier Extra Damage
×2 1d10
×3 2d10
×4 3d10
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Lore: Few rangers acquire the skills
needed to create magic items, but the
gnome ranger Tir Hearthand learned to
hate orcs at an early age. Unsatisfi ed with
normal orc bane weapons, he devoted the
last half of his life to creating the ultimate
weapon for slaying orcs (Knowledge
[arcana] or Knowledge [history] DC 20).
The fi rst fi ercebane weapon was an
orc bane scimitar sized for a gnome and
named Hearthand, after its creator. Tir
Hearthand wielded this weapon for many
years, and it eventually achieved a near-legendary
status. Gnomes with an interest in
weaponcraft now believe it to be a potent
artifact capable of striking dead any orc
that even sets eyes upon it. The original
weapon is believed to have been lost in
the dark hills near the long-dead orc kingdom
where Tir Hearthand met his end
(Knowledge [arcana] or Knowledge [history]
DC 30).

FLESHGRINDING
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Piercing or slashing melee
weapon
Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) transmutation
Activation: Free (command)
Upon close inspection, this weapon appears to
have shallow serrations along its blade.
You can activate a fl eshgrinding weapon
any time you deal damage with it to a living
creature in melee. When this occurs, you
let go of the weapon and it magically animates,
grinding itself into the foe’s fl esh. In
each round at the start of your turn, it automatically
damages that creature as if you
had scored a normal hit with it (including
damage from the weapon’s enhancement
bonus, other weapon properties, and your
normal bonus from Strength, but not extra
damage from feats such as Power Attack).
The grinding continues for 5 rounds or
until you or someone else pulls the fl eshgrinding
weapon free; doing this requires a
standard action and (for anyone other than
you) a successful DC 20 Strength check.

FORCE
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Projectile weapon
Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) evocation
Activation: —
This weapon appears translucent, as though its
substance is not entirely of this world.
A projectile weapon with the force property
turns ammunition shot from it into a
force attack. These force projectiles automatically
overcome damage reduction and
suffer no miss chance against incorporeal
targets, but they don’t damage creatures
immune to force effects. Ammunition shot
from a force weapon deals the same amount
of damage as normal ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, magic missile.
Cost to Create: Varies.

Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) conjuration
Activation: —
Synergy Prerequisite: Ghost touch
Fine tendrils of white smoke slowly rise from
this weapon’s surface.
A ghost strike weapon functions as a
ghost touch weapon (DMG 224). In addition,

weapon when you begin a bardic music
effect, the weapon can continue the
effect for you, allowing you to focus on
other efforts. One round after you begin a
bardic music effect that allows or requires
continued use or concentration (including
inspire courage, countersong, fascinate,
inspire competence, inspire greatness,
song of freedom, and inspire heroics), the
weapon picks up and continues the performance
fl awlessly for 10 rounds, until
you start another bardic music effect, or
until you command it to end as a swift
(mental) action.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, ghost sound, bardic music.

HEAVENLY BURST
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 7th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) evocation
Activation: —
This weapon emits a low hum that sounds
distinctly like a chorus chanting slowly.
On a critical hit against an evil creature,
a heavenly burst weapon discharges a
shower of radiance that deals 3d6 points
of damage to the target and blinds it for 1
round. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save
negates the blindness.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, holy smite.
Cost to Create: Varies.
HIDEAWAY
Price: +2,000 gp
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) transmutation
Activation: Swift (command)
Several studs texture this weapon, as do numerous
hinges and slots, though none seems to
impede its effectiveness.
When activated, a hideaway weapon
folds up into a bundle two size categories
smaller than you, making it easy to
conceal. You gain a +2 bonus on Sleight
of Hand checks to conceal a hideaway
weapon when it’s folded up (as if it were
a dagger).
A second command word (also a swift
action) causes the weapon to unfold to its
normal shape.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, shrink item.
Cost to Create: 1,000 gp, 80 XP, 2 days.
HOLY SURGE [SYNERGY]
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Melee weapon
Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) evocation
Activation: — and swift (command)
Synergy Prerequisite: Holy
This elegant weapon appears smooth and
pristine.
Characters who serve gods of valor, honor,
and other lofty principles craft these
weapons of pure goodness for themselves
and others who share their values. A holy
surge weapon functions as a holy weapon
(DMG 225). This is a continuous effect and
requires no activation.
In addition, on a successful melee
attack with a holy surge weapon, you
can command it to emit a burst of holy
energy. Against an evil target, this burst
deals an extra 3d6 points of damage. If
used against a non-evil creature, it deals
no additional damage, and that use of the
property is wasted.
This ability is usable a number of times
per day equal to 1 + your Cha bonus (if
any). Once you activate this property, it
can’t be activated by any other creature
until the following day.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, holy smite or holy word.
Cost to Create: Varies.
HUNTING
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 6th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) abjuration
Activation: —
This weapon bears toothlike inscriptions across
its surface.
A hunting weapon increases your bonus
on weapon damage rolls by 4 against your
favored enemies (see the ranger class feature;
PH 47).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, greater magic fang.
Cost to Create: Varies.
IGNAN
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 7th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) evocation
Activation: —
Tiny fl ames constantly fl icker along the surface
of this red-tinted weapon. Its grip is inlaid with
amber in a fl amelike design.
An ignan weapon automatically overcomes
the damage reduction of any
creature that has the water subtype. In
addition, the weapon deals an extra 2d6
points of damage against such targets.
An ignan weapon also bestows one
negative level on any creature that has the
water subtype and attempts to wield it.
The negative level remains as long as the
weapon is in hand and disappears when it
is no longer held. This negative level never
results in actual level loss, but it cannot be
overcome in any way (including restoration
spells) while the weapon is wielded.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, fi re subtype.
Cost to Create: Varies.
ILLUMINATING
Price: +500 gp
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) evocation
Activation: —
A sunburst set with topaz fl ecks gleams upon
this weapon.
When drawn, an illuminating weapon
glows with pure white light, brightly
illuminating a 20-foot-radius area and providing
shadowy illumination for another
20 feet beyond that.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, light.
Cost to Create: 250 gp, 20 XP, 1 day.
ILLUSION BANE
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 10th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) divination
Activation: — and swift (command)
Worked into the grip of this weapon is an
iron cross set in the center of two concentric
circles.
Any attack with an illusion bane weapon
ignores any miss chance created by an illusion
effect (including effects that mimic
illusions, such as a displacer beast’s displacement
effect). However, you must still
target the correct square when making
an attack against a for that has total concealment.
This is a continuous effect and
requires no activation.
In addition, once per day you can activate
an illusion bane weapon to destroy
illusion effects. This ability can take one
of two forms:
After hitting a creature, you can activate
the weapon in the same round to make a
dispel check (1d20+10) against each illusion
spell currently affecting the target.
This effect essentially acts as a targeted
dispel magic spell, but it functions only
against magic of the illusion school. You
must make a separate check for each illusion
spell affecting the target.
Alternatively, you can attempt to dispel
a single illusion by touching it with the
37
CHAPTER 2
WEAPONS
illusion bane weapon and speaking the
appropriate command word. For example,
touching a silent image spell (or an image
generated by the mirror image spell) with
the weapon subjects it to the dispel check
immediately. A successful check against
any part of the illusion dispels the whole
effect, so dispelling one mirror image ends
the spell entirely for the target creature.
Lore: The illusion bane property was
created by a sect of the church of St.
Cuthbert whose members despised illusionists
and desired a way to destroy their
protective illusions (Knowledge [religion]
DC 20).
An illusion bane weapon functions
much like the dispel magic spell, but
only against illusion effects (Knowledge
[arcana] DC 25).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, true seeing, dispel magic.
Cost to Create: Varies.
ILLUSION THEFT
[SYNERGY]
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 17th
Aura: Strong; (DC 23) divination
Activation: Standard (command)
Synergy Prerequisite: Illusion bane
This dark metal weapon is crafted of black iron
and adamantine worked into a simple design.
Set into its pommel or grip is a cut and polished
piece of quartz.
An illusion theft weapon functions as an
illusion bane weapon (see above).
In addition, such a weapon allows you
to disrupt opponents’ illusions and transfer
their protective qualities to yourself.
The fi rst illusion spell that this weapon
dispels with its illusion bane property
is automatically stored within it. This
ability functions like the spell storing
property (DMG 225), with the following
exceptions.
• It must be an illusion spell, but it need
not be 3rd level or lower.
• A spell cannot be cast into the weapon;
it can store only a spell that it has actually
dispelled through the illusion bane
ability.
• An illusion theft weapon need not
actually strike a creature to activate the
stored spell.
The stored spell is preserved as originally
cast in every way, except that its duration
is effectively arrested at the time you steal
it. As soon as the spell is stored, you immediately
become aware of its effect and its
remaining duration, and you can activate
it at any time. You can choose a different
target to be affected by the stored spell if
you so desire. When the spell is activated,
the duration begins passing again as if no
time had elapsed.
Once a stored illusion spell has been
discharged, you cannot activate the
weapon’s illusion theft property again
until you have successfully dispelled
another illusion (using the illusion bane
property), which is then stored within
the weapon.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, true seeing, dispel magic.
Cost to Create: Varies.
IMPACT
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Bludgeoning weapon
Caster Level: 10th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) evocation
Activation: —
This weapon seems heavier than a typical
weapon of its type, and its head and haft have
a square design.
An impact weapon has double the threat
range of a normal weapon of its type. For
example, an impact quarterstaff scores a
threat on a roll of 19–20, and an impact
heavy fl ail scores a threat on a roll of
17–20. This effect doesn’t stack with any
other effect that expands a weapon’s critical
threat range.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, weapon of impact (SC 237).
Cost to Create: Varies.
IMPALING
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Piercing melee weapon
Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) transmutation
Activation: Swift (command)
This weapon has a particularly sharp and
slim point.
Three times per day, you can activate this
weapon to treat its next attack (if made
before the end of your turn) as a touch
attack. You must declare that you are
using this property before making your
attack roll. If the attack misses, the use
is wasted.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, fi nd the gap (SC 91).
Cost to Create: Varies.
IMPEDANCE
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) abjuration
Activation: —
This weapon is reinforced with cold iron and
set with chunks of obsidian in a foursquare
pattern.
An impedance weapon mimics the
impeded magic planar trait (DMG 150).
When you use it to strike a creature, the
target’s ability to cast spells or use spelllike
abilities is impeded for 1d6 rounds. To
cast an impeded spell or use an impeded
spell-like ability, the creature must
attempt a Spellcraft check, Intelligence
check, or Charisma check (whichever
one is made with the highest bonus). The
DC for this check is 15 + the spell level. If
the check succeeds, the effect functions
normally; if the check fails, the effect does
not function and the spell or the use of the
spell-like ability is lost.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, antimagic fi eld.
Cost to Create: Varies.
IMPLACABLE
Price: +3 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) necromancy
Activation: —
This weapon has a lustrous purple sheen.
When an implacable weapon deals damage
to a living creature, the wound bleeds profusely
and the creature takes 2 additional
points of damage at the start of each of
the wielder’s turns for the next 5 rounds.
Multiple wounds are cumulative (a creature
struck three times in the same round
would take 6 points of damage per round
for the next 5 rounds).
This bleeding can be stopped by a successful
DC 15 Heal check or any effect
that restores hit points (such as cure light
wounds). However, while the wound is
active, anyone attempting to cast a spell
on the target that would restore hit
points must succeed on a DC 15 caster
level check.
An implacable weapon counts as adamantine
for the purpose of overcoming
the damage reduction of aberrations.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, vampiric touch.
Cost to Create: Varies.

INCORPOREAL
BINDING [SYNERGY]
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Melee weapon
Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) conjuration
Activation: —
Synergy Prerequisite: Ghost touch
This weapon is simple in design and appears
misty gray, even though the base material
used in its construction has a distinct color
of its own.
An incorporeal binding weapon functions
as a ghost touch weapon (DMG 224).
In addition, when this weapon strikes
an incorporeal creature, it emits a single
pulse of gray energy that temporarily
anchors the target more fi rmly to the
material world. An incorporeal creature
damaged by this weapon loses the benefi
t of its incorporeal miss chance (50%)
and its 50% chance to ignore spells for 1
round. It does, however, retain all other
benefi ts of incorporealness, including
immunity to all nonmagical attack forms,
the ability to pass through solid objects,
and a defl ection bonus to AC equal to its
Charisma bonus (if any).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, dimensional anchor, plane shift.
Cost to Create: Varies.
KNOCKBACK
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) evocation
Activation: Swift (command)
This weapon looks broader and thicker than a
typical item of its type. A ram’s head with curling
horns decorates its head or hilt.
Three times per day, you can activate this
weapon and use it to drive your opponent
back. The next time you hit a creature
with the weapon before the end of your
turn, the target must succeed on a DC 19
Fortitude save or be pushed back 5 feet.
If the target can’t move back, this ability
has no effect. The knockback property
works only on creatures of your own size
category or smaller.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, repulsion.
Cost to Create: Varies.

Caster Level: 8th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) evocation
Activation: —
The surface of this black iron weapon is
inscribed with runes representing the grounding
of energy, and its pommel or grip is set with
three diamonds.
Weapons that have this property are
feared by arcane spellcasters. Against
any creature that can cast arcane spells
or use invocations (CAr 7), a magebane
weapon’s enhancement bonus is 2 higher
than normal. (Thus, a +1 longsword with
the magebane property becomes a +3 longsword
when wielded against such targets.)
Furthermore, a magebane weapon deals an
extra 2d6 points of damage against targets
capable of casting arcane spells or using
invocations.
The magebane property can be added
to a cold iron weapon without paying the
extra 2,000 gp (DMG 284).
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, dispel magic.

deals an amount of extra damage depending
on its critical multiplier.

Activation: Free (mental)
Radiating inner power, this princely weapon
settles and clarifi es your thoughts.
When manifesting a power, the bearer

MIGHTY SMITING
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Melee weapon
Caster Level: 8th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) evocation
Activation: —
This weapon feels heavier than a normal
weapon of its type. Inscribed on its surface is
a message affi rming its superiority over some
category of creature.
If you have a smite ability (smite, smite
evil, smite shadowlands, or the like), you
gain an extra +2 bonus on your smite
attack rolls and damage rolls. In addition,
you gain one additional use of your
smite ability each day while wielding this
weapon. If you have more than one smite
ability, you must choose which one gains
the extra use.
A weapon of mighty smiting only
grants one extra smite per day, regardless
of how many characters wield it.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, divine power.
Cost to Create: Varies.
MINDCRUSHER
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 12th
Aura: Strong; (DC 21) necromancy
Activation: —
This red-tinted weapon seems to draw light and
feeling from around it. You sense its hunger.
Any psionic creature struck in combat by
a mindcrusher weapon loses a number of
power points equal to half the amount
of hit point damage the weapon deals
on that strike. Only the base damage
of the weapon contributes to the power
point loss; additional damage from high
Strength or other sources does not cause
additional power point loss. A creature
with no power points, including
any nonpsionic creature, must succeed
on a DC 17 Will save or take 1 point of
Wisdom damage.
A projectile weapon bestows this property
upon its ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, vampiric touch or psychic vampire
(EPH 127).
Cost to Create: Varies.
MINDFEEDER
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 15th
Aura: Strong; (DC 22) necromancy
Activation: —
Composed of a fl at, rough, slate-gray crystal,
this weapon seems to absorb your thoughts.
When you score a critical hit with a mindfeeder
weapon, you gain 1 temporary power
point for every 5 points of damage dealt
by the critical hit. These temporary power
points last for up to 1 minute. You gain
power points even if the target has none.
As with temporary hit points, temporary
power points do not stack with each
other; they overlap. Thus, if the wielder of
a mindfeeder weapon successfully scores
a critical hit while still enjoying temporary
power points from a previous critical
hit, the wielder gains only the higher of
the two values: either her current number
of temporary power points, or the new
infl ux of temporary power points, whichever
is greater. Creatures immune to extra
damage from critical hits do not trigger
mindfeeder weapons.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, vampiric touch or psychic vampire
(EPH 127).
Cost to Create: Varies.
MORPHING
Price: +1 bonus
Property: Melee or thrown weapon
Caster Level: 9th

Activation: Standard
This weapon’s shape constantly fl ows and
reforms in slightly different compositions.
You can reshape a morphing weapon into
any other melee or thrown weapon of the
same size and type (light, one-handed,
or two-handed). For instance, a morphing
greatsword could become a spear,
greataxe, or dire fl ail.
If a single weapon created with the morphing
property becomes a double weapon,
only one end of the double weapon retains
the weapon’s magical bonus, although
the other end is masterwork. If a double
weapon created with the morphing
property becomes a single weapon, it
can have the properties of either end of
the original double weapon. The properties
of the other end are dormant but not
lost; they become active again when the
morphing weapon once again becomes a
double weapon.

Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 12th
Aura: Strong; (DC 21) evocation
Activation: Free (command)
This weapon is composed of a white, honeycomb
substance of substantial weight.
A power storing weapon allows a manifester
to store a single targeted power of
up to 5 power points in the weapon. (The
power must have a manifesting time of
1 standard action.) Any time the weapon
strikes a creature and the creature takes
damage from it, the weapon can manifest
the power on that creature if you
desire. Once the power is manifested,
the weapon is empty, and a manifester
can store any other targeted power of
up to 5 power points into it. The weapon
telepathically whispers to you the name
of the power currently stored within it.
A randomly generated power storing

A profane burst weapon deals even more
damage to good outsiders on a successful
critical hit. This burst does not harm you or
any creature other than the target if you are
undead; otherwise, you take 1d4 points of
Constitution damage (or Charisma damage
if you have no Constitution score). This is
a continuous effect and requires no activation.
Even if the weapon has not been
activated to deal extra damage because
of the profane property, the weapon still
deals its extra negative energy damage on
a successful critical hit.

PSIBANE
Price: +2 bonus
Property: Weapon
Caster Level: 15th
Aura: Strong; (DC 22) divination
Activation: —
This extraordinary weapon is shot through
with translucent purple crystal shards. You
detect a vague air of menace about it.
A psibane weapon is crafted to oppose
psionic beings. When used against any
creature that has the psionic subtype (EPH
183), its effective enhancement bonus is 2
higher than its actual enhancement bonus
(so a +1 psibane longsword instead has a +3
enhancement bonus against psionic foes). It
deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against
psionic opponents.
A psibane weapon bestows one negative
level on any psionic creature attempting to
wield it. This negative level remains as long
as the weapon is in hand and disappears
when the weapon is no longer wielded.
This negative level never results in actual
level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any
way while the weapon is wielded.
Projectile weapons bestow this property
upon their ammunition.

Activation: —
This weapon has an inner glow of varying

A psychic weapon’s power depends on its
wielder. It gains an enhancement bonus
based on the wielder’s current power point
reserve, as shown on the table below. (This
benefi t doesn’t stack with the weapon’s
normal enhancement bonus.) The weapon’s
enhancement bonus decreases (to a
minimum of +1) as the wielder spends
power points, and it increases whenever
the wielder gains enough power points (by
any means) to put his power point reserve
into the next higher category.

This weapon functions as an enervating

A terran weapon also bestows one
negative level on any creature that has
the air subtype and attempts to wield it.
The negative level remains as long as the
weapon is in hand and disappears when it
is no longer held. This negative level never
results in actual level loss, but it cannot be
overcome in any way (including restoration

TRANSMUTING
Price: +2 bonus

Activation: —
This odd-looking weapon has both sharp and
blunt sections. Its pommel or grip is set with a
diamond, a piece of jet, a sapphire, and a ruby.
In addition, it is inlaid with both adamantine
and silver.
When you score a successful hit with a
transmuting weapon against a creature
that has damage reduction, that attack is
resolved normally. At the start of your next
turn, however, the weapon transforms,
taking on the properties required to overcome
that creature’s damage reduction.
Once so changed, the weapon overcomes
the designated type of damage reduction
for 10 rounds, or until you strike a creature
that has a different type of damage reduction.
In this case, the weapon transforms in
the same manner to overcome that damage
reduction instead. If the target has multiple
types of damage reduction, the weapon
overcomes all of them. If the creature gains
a new type of damage reduction after initially
being struck (from changing its form,
for example), the weapon must change again
before it can overcome the new type.
A transmuting weapon does not gain
any other benefi t of the properties it takes
on, and it always deals normal damage.

Armor, fabricate.

In addition, on a successful melee
attack with an unholy surge weapon, you
can command it to emit a burst of unholy
energy, which deals an extra 3d6 points of
damage to a good-aligned target. If used
against a non-good creature, it deals no
additional damage, and that use of the
ability is wasted.
This ability is usable a number of times

Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) necromancy
A ctivation: — (ammunition)

This long arrow features alternating bands of
red, yellow, and black, similar to the markings
of a poisonous serpent. Instead of an arrowhead,
the fang of a gigantic snake is fastened
to its tip.
This +1 arrow injects any creature it strikes
with poison (injury, Fort DC 16, 1d6
Con/1d6 Con).
An arrow of biting can also be created as
a crossbow bolt for the same price.

Aura: Faint; (DC 17) transmutation
Activation: Free (command)

Although this seems to be nothing more than
a tangled, long-leafed vine, one end has been
knotted into a sturdy handle like that of a
whip.
Twice per day, you can activate this +1
whip after successfully hitting a Medium
or smaller target that is standing on the
ground. Doing this causes tendrils of vegetation
to spring forth from the ground,
entangling the target and dealing 2d6
points of damage per round. This effect
lasts for 3 rounds or until the affected creature
escapes from the tendrils (a DC 20
Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist
check made as a full-round action).

Aura: Strong; (DC 25) transmutation

A holy symbol of Moradin decorates the joint
between the head and the haft of this sturdy
adamantine waraxe.
When you wield an axe of ancestral
virtue, it functions as a +1 keen adamantine
dwarven waraxe if you are lawful good,
lawful neutral, or neutral good. Prized by
the faithful of the Soul Forger, these weapons
have long been used in the defense of
dwarf holdings.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, an axe of
ancestral virtue reveals its intelligence
and sentience (AL LN; Int 10, Wis 17,
Cha 17; speech, telepathy, darkvision 120
ft., hearing; Ego score 17). In addition,
the axe can use bless, cure moderate wounds
(wielder only), and faerie fi re, each three
times per day.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Moradin and either sacrifi ce a 5th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer

7th-level divine
slot (or have the
True Believer
feat and at least
13 HD), the
weapon can
also use haste
(wielder only)
three times per
day.
Lore: Untold
years ago, one of
Moradin’s high priests
volunteered to be bound
into the original axe of
ancestral virtue so that the weapon would
have both intelligence and the virtuous
nature to serve Moradin well. This
priest’s personality has been duplicated
into the few copies of the weapon that
have been forged since. The weapon
has never revealed the priest’s original
name to any user, but judging from the
fact that the axe constantly urges its
wielder to attack the ancient enemies
of the dwarves (goblinoids and giants),
he must have been a fi erce warrior
indeed. The weapon takes great delight
in “illuminating targets” (faerie fi re), “salving
honor-wounds” (cure moderate wounds),
and granting “godspeed” (haste). The axe
also judges its wielders on how well they
adhere to traditional dwarf culture, and
it rebels mightily against nondwarves
who so much as pick it up (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms
and Armor, Sanctify Relic,
bless, cure moderate
wounds, faerie fire,
haste, keen edge.
Cost to Create:
2,500 gp (plus

shod with silver, and its grip is wound
with blue metal wire.

good, neutral good, or chaotic neutral. It
adjusts its pull automatically, allowing you

Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, this bow
gains the frost and drow bane weapon
properties (DMG 224).
To use the relic power, you must

weapons for keeping their prisoners subdued.
A chain of obeisance functions as a +1
unholy spiked chain if you are lawful evil,
neutral evil, or lawful neutral.
Relic Power: Despite its size and
apparent unwieldiness, if you have established
the proper divine connection, you
can wield this weapon in a grapple as if it
were a light weapon. If you pin your opponent
while wielding a chain of obeisance,
the foe must succeed on a DC 22 Will
save or be dominated as by the dominate

CUDGEL THAT
NEVER FORGETS

P rice (Item Level): 20,312 gp (15th)
Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25)
conjuration
Activation: —; see text
Weight: 8 lb.
This heavy mace has a fl anged iron head and
a thick wooden shaft wrapped in leather cord.
At its base is an intricately carved metal representation
of a stern, bearded face.
This weapon was created to aid the followers
of St. Cuthbert in exacting just
retribution for wrongful acts. When you
wield a cudgel that never forgets, it functions
as a +1 axiomatic heavy mace if you are
lawful neutral, lawful good, or neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, this
weapon reveals its intelligence and sentience
(AL LN; Int 16, Wis 10, Cha 16;
speech [Abyssal, Celestial, Common,
and Infernal], darkvision 60 ft., hearing,
Intimidate 10 ranks for a total modifi er
of +13). In addition, the mace can produce
a cure moderate wounds effect three
times per day.
To use the relic power, you must worship
St. Cuthbert and either sacrifi ce
a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the
True Believer feat and at least 9 HD. If
you sacrifi ce a 7th-level divine slot (or you
have the True Believer feat and at least
13 HD), the cudgel also remembers
which foes have struck you and
deals extra damage to them in
retribution thereafter. If an
enemy hits you with a weapon
(including a natural weapon),
the cudgel thereafter has
an enhancement bonus
2 higher than normal
against that foe. It also
deals an extra 2d6 points
of damage against that foe.
No disguise or shapechanging
ability can guard against
this ability.
A cudgel that never forgets
speaks little except during
combat, during which it reminds
you in stentorian tones about the
transgressions of each enemy,
whether it has witnessed them
personally (“That bugbear hath
wounded Lidda most grievously”)
or simply assumed wrongdoing
based on creature type (“That succubus
hath surely tempted many
good men toward evil”). The imprecations
of a cudgel that never forgets
count as an attempt to demoralize
an opponent with the Intimidate
skill (PH 76). Unless it’s healing
you, a cudgel attempts to demoralize
an opponent every round
during your turn.

forgets was crafted by a master

bonus on saves against enchantment and
fear effects.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Aura: Strong; (DC 25)
abjuration
Activation: —; see text
Weight: 1 lb.
This black-bladed dagger has a wavy
blade and a hilt set with a chunk of
fool’s gold.
When you wield this weapon, it
functions as a +1 unholy dagger.
Unlike most relics, a dagger of
denial functions for a wielder of
any alignment, and it retains its
sentience and basic relic powers
even if you don’t establish the proper
divine connection, though it will not
reveal its intelligence to you or use any
relic powers on your behalf. However, if
you aren’t neutral, lawful evil, neutral
evil, or chaotic evil, the dagger betrays
you at the fi rst available opportunity. A
dagger of denial starts working against
you by surreptitiously dispelling your
spells and those of your allies, leaving
you without the magic you depend on
for battle.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, a dagger
of denial reveals its intelligence and sentience
(AL NE; Int 18, Wis 10, Cha 18;
speech, telepathy, darkvision 120 ft.,
blindsense, hearing, Intimidate 10 ranks
for a total modifi er of +13, Spellcraft 10
ranks for a total modifi er of +14, Bluff
10 ranks for a total modifi er of +14, Ego
score 26). In addition, the dagger can use
detect magic at will and greater dispel magic
once per day.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Vecna and either sacrifi ce a 6th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 11 HD. If you sacrifi ce
an 8th-level divine spell slot (or you have
the True Believer feat and at least 15 HD),
the dagger grants you a continuous detect
scrying effect and can use arcane eye once
per day.
A dagger of denial takes great glee in
disrupting other spellcasters. It giggles
and cackles to you constantly when facing
enemy spellcasters. It generally readies
an action to counterspell such a foe’s
spellcasting with greater dispel magic.
Lore: The four daggers of denial known
to exist were originally gifts from Vecna
to the wizards he charged with keeping
his priests in line (Knowledge [religion]
DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, Sanctify Relic, arcane eye,

magic.

Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25) evocation
Activation: —
Weight: 2 lb.
This morningstar has a spiked adamantine
head and a knob of the same metal bonded to
the end of the haft. The junctures of the haft
and the metal portions are decorated with
glowing, cabochon-cut rubies.
Created to help bring the light of goodness
into places of the darkest evil, a dawnstar is
a favorite of Pelor’s clergy. When you wield
a dawnstar, it functions as a +2 morningstar
if you are lawful good, neutral good, chaotic
good, or neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, a dawnstar
gains the brilliant energy property (DMG
224). Furthermore, if it is ever sundered
or otherwise broken, it explodes, dealing
200 points of damage to every creature and
object within 10 feet, 150 points of damage
to all within 20 feet, and 100 points of
damage to all within 30 feet. Each affected
creature can attempt a DC 17 Refl ex save
to halve the damage. You are unharmed
by the explosion.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Pelor and either sacrifi ce a 7th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 13 HD.
Lore: Only four dawnstars are known
to exist. They were originally gifts from
Pelor to four solars who rescued one of his
mortal paladins from Baator (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).

This long, wrought iron spear is clearly capable
of causing devastating wounds. Blackened
ritual runes of death appear along its length.
A death spike allows you to draw the life
energy out of a dying target, granting
you temporary vitality. It functions as a

a living creature to –1 or fewer hit points
on a melee attack with the spear, you can
activate it to gain 1d8 temporary hit points
and a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls.
These benefi ts last for 1 hour; multiple
uses of the spear don’t stack. The spear can
be activated three times per day.
If you also wear a magic item that grants
a bonus to your Charisma score, you can
add the item’s bonus to the temporary hit
points granted by the spear.

Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) conjuration
Activation: — (ammunition)
Weight: —
This redwood arrow
smells acrid and feels
damp to the touch.
A fountainhead arrow is
an otherwise normal arrow
designed to be targeted at a point on
the ground, a wall, or any other fl at surface.
If you hit the target area (treat as AC
5), the arrow creates a geyser of spewing
acid. Each round on your turn (starting on
the turn you fi red the arrow), the arrow
creates a 10-foot-radius burst of acid that
deals 2d8 points of acid damage to all creatures
in the area (Refl ex DC 14 half). This
effect continues for 3 rounds.
A fountainhead arrow can be created as a
crossbow bolt for the same price.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, Melf’s acid arrow.

arrow), 12 XP, 1 day.

Body Slot: —
Caster Level: 10th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) transmutation
Activation: —
Weight: 15 lb.
The head of this massive warhammer is made
of living rock.
A galeb duhr hammer acts as a +1 warhammer.
In addition, if you have the stonecunning
racial ability, the hammer gains an extra
ability. Whenever you score a critical hit
with a galeb duhr hammer against a creature
standing on the ground, the surface
your target is standing on attempts to hold
the creature in place. For 5 rounds, the
victim’s speed falls to 5 feet and it takes a
–2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC.
Lore: Galeb duhrs are enigmatic and
taciturn rock creatures. A galeb duhr
hammer is actually the nascent form of
a galeb duhr, as yet unintelligent, gifted
by the clan fathers to certain dwarves
and other earth friends to serve as a
living weapon against common enemies.
Someone who wields a galeb duhr hammer
without the permission of the hammer’s
creator faces the possibility of being
hunted down and crushed (Knowledge

Aura: Moderate; (DC 21) abjuration
Activation: —
Weight: 1 lb.
This sheet of gossamer-thin netting has an
iridescent sheen.
You can throw this item at a target as
though it were an ordinary net. It has
no effect against corporeal targets, but
any incorporeal target hit by a ghost net is
treated as corporeal for the purpose of dealing
damage to it with physical or magical
attacks (though the net doesn’t entangle
an incorporeal target). It can be hit with
normal weapons (though its normal
damage reduction, if any, still applies), and
it does not have the usual 50% chance to
ignore damage from corporeal sources. A
creature ensnared by a ghost net also cannot
turn ethereal (or, if snared on the Ethereal
Plane, can’t return to the Material Plane).
The creature retains all its other special
abilities and can extract itself from the
net with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist
check as a full-round action. However,
a ghost net can’t be burst with a Strength
check as a normal net can.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, ghost trap (SC 103).

Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 8th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) illusion,
transmutation
Activation: Standard (manipulation)
Weight: 2 lb.
Numerous seams, hinges, and bolts cover this
otherwise simple-looking blunt metal rod. At
one end, fi ve black buttons jut forth.
Similar to a rod of lordly might, a rod of
surprises has both combat and utilitarian
features. Its buttons can be depressed,
singly or in various combinations, to
cause the rod to lengthen and even sprout
a blade. It can be used as a javelin, kama,
longspear, quarterstaff, scythe, shortspear,
short sword, or spear. A rod is treated as a
+1 weapon in any of these forms.
The rod can store a message of up to
twenty-fi ve words as the magic mouth spell,
replaying the message when the triggering
conditions are met (such as when a
specifi c word is spoken). You can reset
the message as a standard action, and you
choose the trigger.
The rod can also lengthen up to 60 feet
and support up to 800 pounds without
bending.

Tightly wrapped and knotted
strands of black leather
make up this short rod,
allowing for a solid grip, which
nonetheless looks incomplete.
On command, a rod of whips grows
a magic tendril of force from one
end that functions as a whip. Once
activated, a rod of whips acts as a +1
dancing whip that can strike incorporeal
creatures as a force effect.
A rod of whips can be activated
three times per day, and each activation
lasts for 10 rounds.

The edges of this elegant rapier
seem to fade and twitch, making
it diffi cult to look at directly and
surrounding it with a blur of
motion though it remains perfectly

When you activate this +1
rapier, it provides you with
the effect of a blink spell

prematurely if you stop holding
the rogue blade. This effect can be
used twice per day.

CHAPTER 2
WEAPONS
This deep red, translucent dagger is carved from
a single piece of crystal. It has a rounded, razorsharp
blade and a second blade-shaped head at
its other end, though the latter is too small to
be usable as a weapon. Its ornate design pays
homage to the gemcutter’s art.
When you wield a ruby blade, it functions
as a +1 axiomatic dagger if you are
lawful evil, lawful neutral, lawful good,
or neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, and if
you have levels in a class that allows you
to rebuke undead, your effective level
in that class is considered 4 higher for
the purpose of bolstering, rebuking, or
commanding undead. This is a continuous
effect and requires no activation.
In addition, you can activate a ruby
blade to produce the effect of a status spell
once per day.
To use the relic power, you must
worship Wee Jas and either sacrifi ce
a 6th-level divine spell slot or have
the True Believer feat and at least
11 HD.
Lore: Legend holds that the fi rst
ruby blades were plucked from
among the gems on the hem of
Wee Jas’s gown. Since then, certain
high priests have acquired the
skill to create them (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms

Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) necromancy
Activation: —
Weight: 2 lb.
The black leather lashes of this terrible
scourge are covered in lengths of rusted
wire, bits of broken red glass, and tiny
fangs.
Each time this +1 scourge strikes, it
deals an extra 1d8 points of nonlethal
damage and causes agonizing pain in
the creature struck. The target takes
a –4 penalty on attack rolls, saving
throws, and checks for 1d4 rounds
(Fort DC 17 negates). Multiple strikes
on the same creature don’t stack.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, symbol of pain.
Cost to Create: 13,000 gp (plus 320 gp

SKEWER-OFGNOMES

Price (Item Level): 9,302 gp (12th)
Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25) evocation
Activation: —
Weight: 4 lb.
This spear has an ornate bone head carved
to resemble a skull with its mouth open in a
scream. Its shaft is set with long spikes, and
the base is shod with a metal tip molded in
the shape of a skull.
Carried primarily by kobold heroes,
these spears were designed to be
true to their name. When you carry
a skewer-of-gnomes, it functions as a
Small +1 gnome bane spear if you
are lawful evil, lawful neutral,
or neutral evil.
Relic Power: If you have
established the proper divine
connection, the spear also gains
the unholy property (DMG 226)
and reveals its quasisentience
and abilities to you. A skewer-ofgnomes
automatically sets
itself against a charge,
attacking and dealing double
damage whenever a foe charges you.
This attack uses your highest base
attack bonus and all relevant modifi ers,
just as if you were making an attack of
opportunity.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Kurtulmak and either sacrifi ce a
5th-level divine spell slot or have the
True Believer feat and at least 9 HD.
Lore: The fi rst four skewers-ofgnomes
were created for the kings
of the most powerful kobold
tribes by weaponsmiths working in
cooperation with Kurtulmak’s clergy.
Since then, the secret of their manufacture
has been passed down from parent
to child and is known to only a handful
of kobold weaponmakers (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, Sanctify Relic, unholy blight.
Cost to Create: 4,500 gp (plus 302 gp for

Price (Item Level): 9,302 gp (12th)
Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25) transmutation
Activation: —
Weight: 6 lb.
The shaft of this rowanwood spear appears
slightly curved, and its base is shod with a
metal arrow point.
Spears of retribution are widely known as
the instruments of Gruumsh’s wrath.
When you wield a spear of retribution,
it functions as a +1 returning spear if
you are chaotic evil, chaotic neutral,
or neutral evil.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, you gain
a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and
damage rolls made with a spear of retribution
against any enemy that dealt damage
to you in the previous round. Against an
enemy that scored a critical hit against
you in the previous round, the spear also
gains the keen property (DMG 225).
To use the relic power, you must worship
Gruumsh and either sacrifi ce a
5th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 9 HD.
Lore: Once in a great while, Gruumsh
fl ings a spear at one of his clerics
with whom he is annoyed. If that
cleric then atones for the transgression
and keeps the spear, it becomes a spear of
retribution (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, Sanctify Relic, righteous might.
Cost to Create: 4,500 gp (plus 302 gp for
masterwork spear), 180 XP, 9 days.

This pocked and notched piece of yellowed bone
seems to have once been used as the pommel for
a dagger, though the blade is now missing.
When you grasp the hilt of a spectral dagger,
a “blade” of ghostly light coalesces into
existence. The weapon has no enhance-

ment bonus (and can’t be imbued with
one). Attacks with a spectral dagger are
treated as touch attacks, but the weapon
does not deal damage normally. Instead,
any target struck by the weapon is affected
by a chill touch spell (Fort DC 11 partial or
Will DC 11 negates; see PH 209). A spectral
dagger fades away if it leaves your hand, so
the weapon can’t be used to make ranged
attacks.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, chill touch.
Cost to Create: 3,000 gp, 240 XP, 6 days.
SPIDER FANG
Price (Item Level): 5,302 gp (9th)
Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) conjuration
Activation: — and standard (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
Of grotesque design, this seemingly organic
dagger appears to be made from sharpened
layers of purple-black chitin. Sinister weblike
patterns cover its surface, and the blade occasionally
twitches and jerks of its own accord.
This +1 dagger quickly cuts
through webs (magical or
otherwise) without getting
stuck. As a move action,
you can cut through a web
entangling you or another
creature. You can move
through webs created by
a web spell at half your
normal speed (although
the weapon doesn’t prevent
you from being stuck in
either of these webs in the
fi rst place). These are continuous
effects and require
no activation.
Once per day, you can
activate a spider fang to
create a freestanding 10-
foot-by-10-foot vertical
curtain of cobwebs. This
curtain doesn’t block movement,
but does provide
concealment to creatures
behind it. Anyone touching
the curtain causes it
to collapse, dealing 2d4
points of acid damage to that
creature.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic
Arms and Armor, Melf’s acid
arrow, web.
Cost to Create: 2,500 gp
(plus 302 gp for masterwork
dagger), 200 XP, 5 days.
STAFF OF THE

Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25) transmutation
Activation: Standard (command)
Weight: 4 lb.
This sturdy quarterstaff is formed of living
wood, as evidenced by the tender shoots and
leaves along its length.
A staff of the unyielding oak is actually a
treant bound into quarterstaff form. When
you wield this weapon, it functions as a
+1/+1 quarterstaff if you are neutral, neutral
good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, or
chaotic neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, you can
command this staff to become a treant.
This ability functions like the changestaff
spell, except that the treant is fully
real and can speak to other treants and
animated trees. If a staff of the unyielding oak
in treant form is reduced to 0 hit points or
fewer, it reverts to staff form and cannot be
used again for twenty-eight days. The staff
can take treant form any number of times
per day, but can be in that form for only 12
hours overall during any one day.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Obad-Hai and either sacrifi ce a
8th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 15 HD.
Lore: These staffs, of which three
are known to exist, are treants that have
willingly bound themselves into
quarterstaff form to aid Obad-Hai’s
followers. Each willingly serves for
a year and a day, after which another
treant takes over the responsibility
(Knowledge [religion] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
Sanctify Relic, changestaff.
Cost to Create: 2,500 gp (plus 600 gp
for masterwork/masterwork quarterstaff),

Half of the head of this greataxe is a curved
blade, while the other side tapers to a chiselpoint
pick on the other. The haft looks as
thought it’s made from cracked granite.
In the hands of a nondwarf, stonereaver
functions as a +1 greataxe.
In the hands of a dwarf, the weapon
also gains the bane property (DMG 224)
against elementals that have the earth
subtype and against constructs primarily
made of earth, stone, or metal.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

save (DC equal to your attack roll result)
or be stunned for 1 round.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

This ostentatious greatsword is decorated with
golden fi ligree, and its hilt is set with a large
ruby. Along its blade is an inscription in Draconic
that reads, “Size is not strength.”
These swords were designed for dragonslayers
of great strength. When you wield
a sword of mighty thews, it functions as a
+1 dragonbane greatsword, provided that
you are chaotic good, neutral good, or
chaotic neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, you are
immune to the frightful presence of
dragons as long as you wield the sword.
In addition, you gain a +5 luck bonus

Kord has awarded one every decade to a
hero who has earned his favor (Knowledge

Activation: —
Weight: 4 lb.
The blade of this golden longsword is set with
four cabochon-cut rubies, and its pommel sports
a ruby-centered golden sun.
A sword of virtue beyond reproach is designed
to grant a measure of respite from charms
and compulsions. When you wield this
weapon, it functions as a +1 holy longsword
if you are lawful good, neutral good, or
lawful neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection and you
fail a save against an enemy’s charm or
compulsion effect while wielding the
sword, you are immune to its effects for
1d4 rounds (DM rolls secretly). The effect
is only suppressed during this time, not
negated. When the period of suppression
ends, any effects received during previous
rounds take effect.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Heironeous and either sacrifi ce a
6th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 11 HD.
Lore: Four of these longswords were
commissioned from celestial dwarves
by the great paladin Tardalius the Headstrong,
who won favor from Heironeous
for his conspicuous valor. Tardalius presented
the swords to his four sons, who
followed in his footsteps (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).

Activation: Free (command)
Weight: 3 lb.
The limbs of this bow appear to be
made of sharpened metal, as if the
bow had been crafted from two thin,
flexible swords.
This +1 longbow changes into a +1
longsword (or vice versa) when activated.
You can interchange bow and
sword attacks as part of the same
full attack action.
In sword form, the weapon features
a bowlike grip and a pommel
that resembles the curving tip of a
bow. In bow form, the weapon is
made of metal, and each limb of
the bow resembles a sword blade.
In either form, a swordbow has
the same enhancement bonus. A
swordbow’s enhancement bonus
can be improved as if improving
two separate weapons (for example,
improving a +1 swordbow to a +2 swordbow
costs 12,000 gp, just as if you were improving
two +1 weapons to +2). A swordbow can
have special weapon properties added to
it (such as fl aming); such properties cost
twice the normal amount (again, as if
improving two separate weapons) and apply
to both weapons if possible. If a property
can’t apply to both weapons (such as vorpal
or distance), it applies only to the swordbow
when it is in an eligible form (for instance, a
+1 swordbow of distance is a distance weapon
only in bow form). If a property can apply to
the weapon in only one of its forms, it does
not cost double the regular price.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Small and compact, this bow seems made of
thin, but strong, metal sharp enough to rival

This item functions as a swordbow, except
that its two forms are a +1 shortbow and
a +1 rapier.

WEAPONS
Three long, russet-colored tentacles sprout
from the end of this 2-foot-long rod, writhing
sinuously.
When activated, a tentacle rod makes
three attacks (one per tentacle) against
a single target within your melee reach
that you designate. The rod uses its own
attack bonus (+12) rather than yours, and
each attack deals 6 points of bludgeoning
damage. Treat the rod as a magic weapon
for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
If all three tentacles strike the same
living creature in a round, that creature
becomes slowed (as the slow spell) for 5
rounds (Fort DC 14 negates).
Lore: The secret to crafting the fi rst
tentacle rod was learned through nightmarish
visions granted by the Elder Elemental
Eye (a vile and mysterious divine entity)
to its most devoted followers (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).
Wielding one of these gruesome items
soon became a status symbol among the
cult’s leaders, which led to a need for a
greater version for the most powerful
followers of the Elder Elemental Eye
(Knowledge [religion] DC 25).

Six long violet tentacles sprout from the end of
this 2-foot-long rod, writhing sinuously when
you grasp the handle.
When activated, a greater tentacle rod makes
six attacks (one per tentacle) against a
single target within your melee reach
that you designate. The rod uses its own
attack bonus (+18), and each attack deals 9
points of bludgeoning damage. Treat the
rod as a magic weapon for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.
If at least three of a greater tentacle rod’s
tentacles strike the same living creature
in a round, that creature becomes fatigued
(Fort DC 20 negates); creatures already
fatigued suffer no additional effect. If all
six tentacles strike the same living creature
in a round, that creature instead becomes
exhausted (Fort DC 20 negates).
Lore: See tentacle rod, above.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

When you activate this +1 trident, it creates
a calm emotions effect centered on you
(Will DC 16 negates). The effect lasts for
5 rounds and does not require concentration.
Any creature that successfully saves
against this effect is immune to further
uses of that ability for 24 hours.
This ability functions three times per

Lore: Originally created by aquatic
elves for use against the blood frenzy of
sahuagin, this weapon has become equally
useful in fending off savage barbarians

The hilt of this dagger is shaped like a snake,
and the twisted blade looks like an impossibly
long tongue.
Created by cults that worship serpent deities,
these +1 daggers are prized for their
ability to secrete toxic venom. A viperblade
has 5 charges, which are renewed each
day at dawn. Spending 1 or more charges
envenoms the blade (at no risk to you) for
the next attack you make during this turn.
The poison deals 1d6 points of Constitution

This +1 light mace confers a +1 profane
bonus on your ranged touch
attack rolls while you hold it. This
is a continuous effect and requires
no activation.
Furthermore, a warlock’s scepter has
5 charges, which are renewed each day

This strange weapon looks less like a traditional
whip and more like a tube of water,
tapering along its length to icicle sharpness
at one end. The handle is crafted from a pale
blue crystal shard.
This +1 whip shimmers and undulates
with deceptive grace when held. Unlike
a normal whip, a water whip deals lethal
damage and can affect armored creatures.
Furthermore, while wielding a water whip,
you are diffi cult to disarm. If the whip is
knocked from your grasp, it immediately
fl ows back into your hand at the beginning
of your next turn (even if it is within someone
else’s grasp) as long as it is within 30
feet of you. Doing this requires no action
on your part. In addition, drawing a water
whip is always a free action.
Both a fi re elemental and water elemental
are bound within a water whip, allowing
it to emanate either of two energy properties,
fl aming or frost (DMG 224). You
choose the property when you activate
the whip, and it deals an extra 1d6 points
of the appropriate kind of damage (fi re
or cold).
Lore: The fi rst water whip was created by
a sahuagin druid named Ak’ash’eck, who
roamed the fringes of a great reef a decade
ago (Knowledge [history] DC 20).
Ak’ash’eck enjoyed preying on unwary
folk sailing south to trade with other
sahuagin. He was famous for the trick
of ensnaring a victim near the railing of
a ship passing at night, then pulling the
victim overboard before an alarm could be
raised (Knowledge [history] DC 30).
Prerequisites: Bind Elemental (ECS 51)
or Craft Magic Arms and Armor, planar
binding.

civilized lands were the charred bodies of
Graz’zt cultists left piled outside their dark
abbey’s door after Sir Alax of Bergholdt
cleansed the den with his fi ery sword
(Knowledge [arcana or history] DC 20).

occupies and where it moves during that
duration. The aura is as bright as a torch.
Despite the glow in the square, creatures
that attack the invisible foe still suffer a
50% miss chance; the glow merely allows
them to determine the appropriate square
to attack.
Lesser: As the least crystal, but any
active invisibility effects on the damaged
creature are also suppressed for 1
round (even if the invisibility is natural
or extraordinary).
Greater: As the lesser crystal, but it also

WITCHLIGHT
RESERVOIR
Price (Item Level): 5,000 gp (9th)
Body Slot: — (weapon crystal)
Caster Level: 10th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) necromancy
Activation: Swift (mental)
Weight: —
This coin-sized crystal sphere is inscribed with
arcane sigils representing earth, air, wind,
fi re, magic, death, and beauty. It rattles like
soft thunder.
As its name suggests, a witchlight reservoir
can hold a small quantity of magical
power, which can be used to enhance the
power of a melee weapon. To imbue this
augment crystal with power, you must
directly expose it for 8 hours to one of
the following substances: sunlight, moonlight,
blood, or wine (at least one pint of
either of the last two substances). Each one
of these substances grants the item a different
effect, as described below. Exposing
a full reservoir to a new substance replaces
the old effect with the new effect.
When activated, a reservoir adds an
extra effect to its weapon’s next successful
melee strike (as long as it is made before
the end of your turn). The effect depends
on the substance to which the witchlight
reservoir was exposed (see above).
Sunlight: +2d6 fi re damage (or +4d6
fi re damage if the target is undead).
Moonlight: +2d6 electricity damage
(or +4d6 electricity damage if the target
is a lycanthrope).
Blood: +2d6 damage to a living target.
Wine: –2 penalty on Will saves for 1
round.
A witchlight reservoir functions fi ve
times before it loses its power and must
be imbued again. It is considered a greater
augment crystal.
Lore: The fi rst witchlight reservoir was
recovered by Iggwilv from the vanity
drawer of one of Graz’zt’s previous paramours
(Knowledge [arcana] DC 15).
Who created the first sphere is
unknown, but the Witch of the Yatils
made several more after her discovery,
including one for her daughter Drelzna,
who employed a bastard sword called The
Bleeding Infanta fi tted with a blood-fi lled
witchlight reservoir. She carried the weapon
until it was lost in battle against a gnome
army led by a gold dragon somewhere
between Ket and Perrenland (Knowledge
[arcana] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, burning hands, shocking grasp, touch

Illus. by D. Griffifi th
suit of armor is nice, but any adventurer whose list of
garb begins and ends with “full plate armor” just isn’t
giving himself a reasonable
chance of success. From the
humble ring of feather falling
to the legendary vest of the archmagi, the
roster of useful (even crucial) magic items
worn on the body is vast.
This chapter includes nearly 400
magic items designed as clothing,
jewelry, and the like. Some are fashionable, others crude, but all
provide useful benefi ts that can contribute to your character’s
survival.
More than any other category of items, the collection in
this chapter relies on the body slot entry to constrain your
choices. Unless you’re comfortable
making a lot of ad hoc
decisions about weird combinations,
we recommend that your
campaign only use these items
as designed (rather than switching
abilities around between
various body slots). See “Body
Slots” in Chapter 6 for information on how the body slot
system works.

ADAMANTINE MIND
BLADE GAUNTLETS
Price (Item Level): 2,000 gp (6th)
Body Slot: Hands
Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) transmutation
Activation: —
Weight: 1 lb.
Each of these heavy leather gloves bears a violet
crystal set on a small plate of adamantine.
Adamantine mind blade gauntlets allow you
to give your mind blade the properties of
adamantine. If you are able to enhance
your mind blade (with the mind blade
enhancement class feature), whenever
you materialize your mind blade while
wearing these gauntlets, you can choose
to treat it as an adamantine weapon for the
purpose of ignoring hardness or overcoming
damage reduction. This ability takes
the place of a property with a +1 enhancement
bonus value.
For example, a 6th-level soulknife
wearing the gauntlets could either choose
to apply the gauntlets’ effect or apply
one of the +1 enhancement bonus value
properties given on the table (EPH 29). A
10th-level soulknife could apply both the
gauntlets’ effect and a +1 enhancement
bonus value property rather than applying
a combination of properties from the
table totaling +2.
Adamantine mind blade gauntlets function
an unlimited number of times per
day. The gauntlets require no separate
activation; using them is part of the action
to materialize your mind blade.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate,
mind blade.
Cost to Create: 1,000 gp, 80 XP, 2 days.

when grasped.
When activated, this amulet emits a 30-footradius
area of telepathic noise, centered on
you, for 9 rounds. If any creature in this
area (including you) attempts to manifest
a power, it must succeed on a DC 17 Will
save or pay 4 more points than it otherwise
would for that power manifestation.
The limit on the number of power points
a subject can spend on a power remains
in effect, so a creature that fails its saving
throw might not be able to manifest its
highest-level powers.
An amulet of catapsi functions once
per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, antimagic
fi eld or catapsi (EPH 82).

a creature within 30 feet. You can use this
effect to prevent the death of a creature
reduced below –9 hit points, as long as
the healing provided returns the target’s
hit points to –9 or higher. (For example,
you couldn’t save a creature whose hit
points had been reduced to –19 or lower,
since the amulet can’t provide more than
9 points of healing.)
This amulet has no effect on undead
creatures or creatures immune to healing
spells.
An amulet of emergency healing functions
three times per day.

Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
This strand of ceramic beads is painted with
sedate earth tones.
Devoting your life to healing is often a
thankless job. An amulet of retributive healing
ensures that if you tend to your allies,
you are renewed in turn.
When you activate your amulet, the
next effect you use before the end of your
turn that heals another creature’s damage
also heals you of an equal amount, as long
as you could be healed by that same effect.
If the effect heals multiple creatures, you
only gain the retributive healing once
per effect.
For example, a human cleric casting cure
light wounds on an ally after activating this
amulet would gain the same amount of
healing, but a human wizard casting repair
light damage on her warforged ally would
not benefi t from activating the amulet
(since that spell only affects constructs).

them. Each decade since then, Kord has

Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) conjuration
Activation: Move (command); see text
Weight: 1 lb.
Ten tiny pockets run along the inside of this
otherwise unremarkable leather belt.
Hidden inside this belt are ten small
pockets, each of which seems big enough
to hold only a few coins. Each pocket
actually functions as a small bag of holding
and can hold up to 1/2 cubic foot or
5 pounds of nonliving matter. No object
with any dimension exceeding 6 inches
can be placed in a pocket. Anything placed
inside a pocket effectively has one-tenth
its normal weight, so a full pocket weighs
only 1/2 pound at most.
In addition, two secret pockets lie
behind each visible one, for a total of thirty
pockets in all. The hidden pockets can be
accessed only through a command word.
A true seeing spell reveals the presence of
the hidden pockets but not the command
word needed to open them.
Even when a pocket is full, it never
bulges, so a belt of hidden pouches
stuffed with 150 pounds of items
still looks like an ordinary belt.
To place any object in the belt,
you merely press the object into the belt.
Doing so while speaking the command
word places the object in one of the hidden
pockets (if one of them is empty). Placing
an item in a pocket (hidden or visible) is a
move action that does not provoke attacks
of opportunity.
Naming a stored object and speaking a
second command word draws the named
object out of the belt and places it in your
hand. Doing this is a move action that does
not provoke attacks of opportunity.
You can also reach into one of the ten
regular hidden pockets and draw out an
item, just as if retrieving a stored object
(a move action that provokes attacks of
opportunity).
A casual search won’t reveal any objects
placed in the belt, and searching the
visible pockets cannot reveal anything
stored in the hidden pockets. It is possible
to use a Sleight of Hand check to pluck
something out of one of the ten visible
pockets, but only someone wearing or
holding a belt can access the hidden
pockets, and then only with the correct
command word.

applies normally once the duration of the
item’s effect expires.

of the wall must be placed at any corner of
your space, and the wall can extend in any
direction. The wall must be continuous
and unbroken when created. If its surface
is broken by any object or creature,
the wall fails to form and the spell and
activation are lost.
Any creature passing through the wall
takes damage equal to that normally dealt
by the spell or spell-like ability (with a
minimum of 1 point per level of the spell
or spell-like ability). A successful Refl ex

spell of that level cast by you) halves this

Turning the dial to the left or back to the
middle is a move action.
Four times per day, you can turn the dial
to the right position as a standard action
and aim the lens at a target, unleashing a
searing light effect (as the spell). The dial

both must be worn for the magic to

Aura: Strong; (DC 21) conjuration
Activation: —
Weight: 1 lb.
These lightweight silver bracers depict a
pair of intertwined, snakelike shapes.
Caduceus bracers allow you to convert
your innate healing powers into
other forms of restorative magic. By
sacrifi cing 5 points of healing (derived
from lay on hands, wholeness of body,
or any similar ability that measures your
ability to heal as a daily limit of points),
you can remove 1 point of ability damage
or remove the dazed, fatigued, or sickened
condition from one creature.
Using these bracers in this manner
follows all the normal limitations of your
healing ability. For example, a paladin
using caduceus bracers must touch the
target to be affected (just as with lay on
hands), while a monk wearing these
bracers can affect only herself (since she
can’t use wholeness of body on another
creature).
You can spend extra points for cumulative
effect, For example, you could spend
15 points of healing to remove both the
fatigued condition and 2 points of ability
damage.
You can also combine normal healing
with the bracers’ effect. For instance, you
could spend 25 points to produce the
effects in the previous example and heal
10 points of damage as well.

restoration.

damage from critical hits and sneak attacks
to constructs, elementals, oozes, plants,
and undead as if they were not immune
to such extra damage. You must still roll a

or qualify to deliver sneak attack damage
to gain any benefi t from the bracers. This

other immunity or resistance to extra

Price (Item Level): 15,000 gp (14th)

Caster Level: 13th
Aura: Strong; (DC 21) no school
Activation: Immediate (command)
Weight: 5 lb.
Alternating links of a strange green metal and
ivory make up this chainlike belt.
A desperation chain gives an arcane spellcaster
the opportunity to either avoid
capture or strike back against an enemy.
You can activate a desperation chain when
you are being rendered helpless by an
enemy (such as being pinned, paralyzed, or
dropped to –1 or fewer hit points). When
you activate the chain, you can cast a single
arcane spell of 3rd level or lower without
spending an additional action to do so.
Doing this expends the prepared spell or
spell slot as if you had cast the spell. The
chosen spell must have a casting time no
longer than 1 full round. Casting a spell
in this way requires no verbal or somatic
components and does not provoke attacks
of opportunity. You must still provide any
material components or focus required,
as well as pay any XP or other costs of
the spell.
The spell you cast takes effect after the
effect that rendered you helpless (so it
can’t prevent that effect), though it could
theoretically neutralize or reverse it. For
example, a bard wearing the chain could
cast cure light wounds in response to being
reduced to –3 hit points.
This ability functions once per day.
You must wear a desperation chain for 24
hours before you can access its abilities.
If it is taken off, it becomes inactive until
worn for an additional 24 hours.

a useful or terrible dream to a sleeping
creature. Once per day, the blindfold can

An empowered spellshard is keyed to a specifi
c spell of up to 3rd level. When you
cast the attuned spell, you can use your
empowered spellshard as a focus in addition
to the spell’s normal components (if any).
Doing this empowers the spell (as though
using the Empower Spell feat, but with no
adjustment to spell level or casting time).
The spellshard is activated as a part of the
spellcasting process. The markings on
the shard reveal the spell to which it is
attuned to a character who makes a successful
DC 30 Spellcraft check. The prices

spellshard radiates is the same as that of
the spell to which it is attuned.

Weight: 1 lb.
A small collection of teeth, small scales, knots
of hair, and strange bits of jerky fi lls this pouch.
The worn leather bag’s strings are long enough
to allow the pouch to be worn as a necklace.
This item is keyed to a single type of creature
(aberration, animal, magical beast,
and so on). A pouch keyed to humanoids
or outsiders must be keyed to a subtype as
described in the ranger’s favored enemy
ability (PH 47). While wearing an enemy
spirit pouch, you gain a +1 competence
bonus on attack rolls against creatures
of this type.
If you are a ranger, the pouch increases
your favored enemy bonus against creatures
of its type by 2. If you don’t have the
favored enemy ability, the pouch grants
you a +2 bonus on damage rolls and certain
skill checks as if that type of creature were
your favored enemy.
If a creature of the type keyed to
the pouch wears that pouch, it receives one
negative level. The negative level remains
for as long as the pouch is worn and disappears
when it is no longer carried. The
negative level never results in actual level
loss, but cannot be overcome in any way
(including restoration spells) while the
pouch is worn.

enemy type/subtype matching that of
the pouch.

more of your soulmelds or other essentia
receptacles (see Magic of Incarnum for
details on incarnum).
An essentia helm has 3 charges, which
are renewed each day at dawn. Spending
1 or more charges maximizes the essentia
investment in one or more of your soulmelds
or other essentia receptacles (as
chosen by you when you activate it) for 1
round. Effectively, the helm temporarily
adds essentia to the affected receptacles
(soulmelds, incarnum feats, magic items,
and so on) until it reaches its maximum.
While this ability is in effect, you can’t
reallocate essentia from the affected
receptacle.
1 charge: Maximizes essentia investment
in one receptacle.
2 charges: Maximizes essentia investment
in two receptacles.
3 charges: Maximizes essentia investment
in three receptacles.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
essentia pool, meldshaper.

attempt, you gain a +1 morale bonus on
melee attack rolls and damage rolls and

Erythnul and either sacrifi ce a
5th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 9 HD.

of Erythnul created the original three

followers in large cities, who wore them
to terrify the local citizens (Knowledge

on melee touch attacks while you wear
them.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Hextor and either sacrifi ce a 4th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 7 HD. If you sacrifi ce a
6th-level divine spell or have the True

3rd-level or lower melee touch spell that
you cast is automatically empowered as by
the Empower Spell feat (although such a

and the casting time of the spell isn’t
increased).
Lore: The fi rst pair of these gauntlets
was worn by a priest of Hextor who mercilessly
slew entire villages to make way
for the Blood-Lord’s approaching army
(Knowledge [religion] DC 15).

Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: 1/2 lb.
These black leather gauntlets are studded with
multicolored gems.
Gauntlets of eldritch energy let you imbue
your eldritch blasts (CAr 7) with a particular
type of energy. When you activate these
gauntlets, the next eldritch blast you use
before the end of your turn deals energy
damage (the type of energy depends on
the type of gauntlets) instead of its normal
damage type. You can’t apply the gauntlets’
effect to any blast already affected by an
eldritch essence invocation.
Four varieties of these gauntlets exist.
Each applies a different type of energy
damage to your eldritch blast: gauntlets
of eldritch frost (cold), gauntlets of eldritch
lightning (electricity), gauntlets of eldritch
fire (fi re), and gauntlets of eldritch thunder
(sonic).
This ability can be used three times
per day.

or fi re) for 1 round. Transformed energy
does the same amount of damage, but a
+1 fl aming longsword could be changed
to deal acid, cold, or electricity damage
instead of fi re.
If a weapon produces more than one
type of energy, each activation affects only
one type of energy produced. For example,
if you wield a +1 fl aming shock longsword,
you could activate the gauntlets to change
the fi re damage to acid, cold, or electricity
damage, and you could activate the gauntlets
a second time to change the electricity
damage dealt by the shock property to
acid, cold, or fi re. If your weapon doesn’t
deal energy damage, these gauntlets have
no effect.

although closer inspection reveals them to be
sound. Each is set with small amber crystals
that rest on the tops of the knuckles.
Once per day, gauntlets of mindfi re can be
activated to project a 15-foot cone-shaped
burst of mental sickness. A successful
DC 14 Fortitude save negates the effect.
Any creature that fails its saving throw
contracts a virulent form of mindfi re. A
victim can be infected only once; subsequent
uses of this item on an infected
target produce no further effect.
Mindfi re has no incubation period—a
victim immediately takes 1d4 points of
Intelligence damage. Each day thereafter,
a victim must succeed on a DC 14
Fortitude save or take another 1d4 points
of Intelligence damage. If a victim succeeds
on its Fortitude save two days in a

attacks that count as magic weapons
for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction. Each claw deals 1d6 points of
slashing damage (if you are Medium).
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection and already
have levels in the monk class, you are
treated as if you were a monk of fi ve
levels higher than you actually are for the
purposes of AC, unarmed damage, and
the ki strike ability. This benefi t doesn’t
stack with similar benefi ts (such as from
a monk’s belt). Also, you can treat your
unarmed damage as either bludgeoning
or slashing damage (chosen each time
you attack).
To use the relic power, you must

a 3rd-level divine spell slot or have the

Activation: —
Weight: —
The palms and fi ngertips of these white lace
gloves are threaded with platinum.
While wearing these gloves and handling
an inanimate object, you can learn
details about that object’s previous owner
through the psychic impressions it has
accumulated. The amount of information
revealed depends on how long you study
the object.
1st minute: Last owner’s race.
2nd minute: Last owner’s gender.
3rd minute: Last owner’s age.
4th minute: Last owner’s alignment.
5th minute: How last owner gained and
lost the object.
6th+ minute: Next-to-last owner’s race,
and so on.
Gloves of object reading will not identify
casual users as owners. (Anyone
who uses an object to attack someone or
something is not thereafter considered a
casual user.)
An object without any previous owners,
or without any owners in the past ten
years, reveals no information. If you
employ these gloves additional times on
the same object, the information yielded

Activation: Standard (manipulation)
Weight: —
Hanging from this simple silver bracelet are a
number of charms that look like berries.
A goodberry bracelet provides basic nourishment
and minor healing to its wearer and
her allies. Each day at dawn, as long as it
is worn, this bracelet creates fi ve silver,
berry-shaped charms. When plucked from
the bracelet, a charm becomes an edible
berry with magical properties equivalent
to those created by a goodberry spell, except
that no character can benefi t from more
than one berry per day. Regardless of
whether the charm is eaten, removed but
uneaten, or still on the bracelet, all charms
and berries created by the bracelet disappear
24 hours after they are created.
If you also wear a magic item that grants
a bonus to your Wisdom score, you can
add half the bonus granted by that item
to the healing provided by each berry.
For example, a character wearing this
bracelet and a periapt of Wisdom +4 would
create berries that heal 3 points of damage
(instead of just 1 point).

A heartseeking amulet functions three

Lore: Many sunsets ago in the swamps
of the lizardfolk, the Lizard King battled
the Lava Children. Though he pierced
them repeatedly with his trident, they
were immune to the metal of his weapon;
it passed through them as if they did not
exist. Eventually, he drowned the Lava
Children’s champions in brackish pools
and drove their menace back into the
magma bowels below the Geyser Fens
(Knowledge [history] DC 15).
Eventually, he was able to imbue his
own trident not just with the ability to
ignore metal but also to pass nearly all
physical defenses. Today that secret has
been replicated in the tiny amulets that
resemble his mighty weapon (Knowledge
[history] DC 20).

While worn, an incarnum focus adds 1
to the essentia capacity of any soulmeld
occupying or bound to the chakra it
matches (up to a maximum capacity equal
to your Constitution bonus). See Magic
of Incarnum for information on essentia,
soulmelds, and chakras.
Wearing an incarnum focus does not
prevent you from binding a soulmeld to
the corresponding chakra. This is a specifi
c exception to the normal rule against
binding a soulmeld to the same chakra as
a worn magic item.
Ten different kinds of incarnum focus
exist, one for each chakra (see the table)
Chakra Bind (Any): While an incarnum
focus is bound to its chakra, any

chakra can’t be unshaped except by you,
nor can any essentia invested in it be lost
or drained, except as part of the normal

You can bind an incarnum focus to its
matching chakra even if it is already occupied
by a shaped or bound soulmeld. See
Binding Items to Chakras (MoI 108) for

INQUISITOR BRACERS
Price (Item Level): 1,500 gp (5th)
Body Slot: Arms
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) conjuration
Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
The harsh suns carved into these heavy steel
bracers resemble grim versions of the normally
forgiving visage of Pelor, god of the sun.
Inquisitor bracers provide a potent method
for sorting out normal townsfolk from
conniving vampires or similarly stealthy
undead. After you activate these bracers,
the next melee attack you make before the
end of your turn includes a cure moderate
wounds effect (in addition to the normal
damage dealt by the attack). Ideally, this
effect damages its undead target and
reveals its evil nature, but in cases of mistaken
identity, at least the healing helps
counteract the damage dealt to a living
(and possibly innocent) target.
You can’t use these bracers as part of
a touch attack—only as part of a normal
melee attack. This ability functions three
times per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, cure
moderate wounds.
Cost to Create: 750 gp, 60 XP, 2 days.

Lenses of bright vision allow you to project
light from your eyes. When placed over
your eyes (a standard action), these lenses
meld into your face, and the irises of your
eyes take on a faint yellow hue.
When you activate the lenses, they
create a 15-foot cone of bright light emanating
from your eyes. Unlike normal

effect as a 0-level spell for the purpose of
interacting with darkness effects.

its natural form, shape, and size, and it
cannot assume a different shape for the

Weight: —
This oval purple gem is fl at on one
side. Images of strange runes seem to
materialize and dissipate within it.
A lore gem affixes to your forehead and
can be easily removed (requiring a standard
action either way). While it is worn,
you can better focus your mind and
memory, gaining a +2 competence bonus
on Knowledge checks, though you must
spend a full round in contemplation to
gain this bonus. This is a continuous
effect and requires no activation.
Additionally, a lore gem acts as a spellbook,
allowing a wizard (or any other
spellcaster who requires a spellbook)
to record spells into and prepare spells
directly from the lore gem. The gem
holds up to thirty spells of any
levels, and recording a new spell
into a lore gem requires the
normal amount of time and
expense. You can also erase an
existing spell as a standard
action. A newly created
lore gem is empty of spells,
but a lore gem recovered as
treasure might have spells
recorded within, at the DM’s
option. If so, the value of the
item should increase as if it were
a spellbook.

Weight: —
This heavy bronze amulet features a pair
of wings that cover the upper chest. At the
pendant’s center rests a glimmering, multifaceted
crystal.
Each discipline of psionics has its own
psionatrix. Wearing one adds a +1 enhancement
bonus to the save DC of powers of
the appropriate discipline. For example,
the DC to resist psionic suggestion is 1
higher when the caster wears a psionatrix
of telepathy.

attacks of opportunity as normal for movement,
though the rapidity of your travel
makes your form blurry, providing concealment
against such attacks.

cult to separate, as if a magical fi eld attracts

against them. If you score a hit in melee

Activation: Immediate (command)
Weight: —
Dark birds of prey, four small chains, and a
black-and-yellow checkered fi eld adorn these
leather gloves.
Inspired by the spells of the legendary
wizard Bigby, these gloves help keep
enemies at a safe distance. You can activate
repelling gauntlets only when a visible
enemy moves into a square adjacent to
you. That enemy must attempt a DC 17
Refl ex save; if this fails, it is immediately
pushed 5 feet away from you and it loses
any remaining movement allowed in
that action (though it can use additional
actions to move farther).
For example, if a wolf (speed 50 feet)
moved 30 feet into a square adjacent to you,
and it failed its save against the effect, you
would push it 5 feet away from you in any
direction and it would lose the remaining
20 feet of that move action. It could then
use another move action, if it still had one,
to close the remaining distance. If the wolf
were charging, its entire full-round action
would be wasted.
This ability functions once per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
Bigby’s interposing hand.

of combat.
Any two or more ring wearers need
only touch their rings together (a standard
action) and speak the command
word in unison to attune the rings to each

A ring of entropic defl ection provides a
mobile wearer with protection against
ranged attacks. At the end of any turn,
if you are at least 10 feet from the point
where you started your turn, this ring

action). Doing so reduces the size of
the donor’s essentia pool by 1. The ring can
hold no more than 1 point of essentia.
At any time within the next 24 hours,
you can use this essentia as if it were part of
your own essentia pool—even if you don’t
have essentia of your own—simply by willing
its release while you wear the ring.
The stored essentia returns to its original
owner automatically after you use it,
or after 24 hours if it remains unused.
Alternatively, the donor of the stored
essentia can reclaim it earlier by touching
the ring and willing it to return (a
standard action).

Four clouds, each a different shade of green or

of four old men puffi ng up their cheeks are also
carved into the sides.
When you activate a ring of the four winds,
it creates gusts of wind that grant you a

attack.
Alternatively, you can activate it to use
a feather fall effect on yourself.
This ring functions a total of four times

RING OF GREATER
COUNTERSPELLS
Price (Item Level): 16,000 gp (14th)
Body Slot: Ring
Caster Level: 15th
Aura: Strong; (DC 22) abjuration
Activation: — and immediate
(command)
Weight: —
This white gold ring is forged in a braided pattern.
A single ruby set in its center fl ickers and
pulses with magical energy.
A ring of greater counterspells can hold a spell
of 1st through 6th level, much like a ring of
counterspells. You cannot cast a stored spell
out of the ring, but should that spell ever
be cast upon you, it is immediately countered,
as a counterspell action, requiring
no action (or even knowledge) on your
part. This use causes the ruby stone to fl ash
once and uses up the stored spell. Once
it is gone, a new spell (or the same one as
before) can be placed into the ring.
If you are a spellcaster capable of countering
a spell on your own, you can also
access the ring’s secondary ability. Once
per day as an immediate action, you can
attempt to counter a single spell cast by
a spellcaster you can see, provided he
is within 100 feet. Like the ring’s other
ability, this one requires no preparation
or knowledge on your part. You need not
make a Spellcraft check to identify the
spell being cast, and the spell you use
to counterspell can be of any level. This
counterspell attempt functions like greater
dispel magic used to counter a spell, except
that you add your caster level to the counterspell
check (maximum +20). Thus, a
12th-level wizard wearing a ring of greater
counterspells would roll 1d20+12 when activating
this ability. When you activate this
secondary effect, the braids of white gold
seem to twist and writhe on your fi nger,
and the metal glows faintly is if it were
growing hot, although you feel no heat.
Prerequisites: Forge Ring, greater dispel
magic, imbue with spell ability.

Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) evocation
Activation: Swift (mental)
Weight: —
This ring is crafted from interwoven bands of
copper and electrum.
When you activate a ring of lightning fl ashes,
it emits a powerful blast of lightning that
deals 5d6 points of electricity damage
(Refl ex DC 13 half) to all creatures within
5 feet (other than yourself). Any creature
that is in physical contact with you at the
time (grappling, engulfi ng, swallowing, or
the like) receives no saving throw against
the blast.
This ability functions three times per
day.
Prerequisites: Forge Ring, lightning bolt.
Cost to Create: 5,750 gp, 460 XP,

Caster Level: 14th
Aura: Strong; (DC 22) no school
Activation: —; see text
Weight: —
These thin, interlocking rings are made of different
metals, including silver, adamantine,
mithral, and platinum.
A ring of master artifi ce functions only if
you can imbue infusions (see the EBERRON
Campaign Setting). Assembling the ring
from its various components requires 5
minutes and a successful DC 22 Intelligence
check, which you can attempt any
number of times. Once assembled, a ring
of master artifi ce must be worn for 24 hours
for its magic to take effect. After that time,
you gain the ring’s benefi t every time you
concentrate to regain your daily allotment
of infusions.
The ring increases the number of infusions
you can imbue daily. A ring of master
artifi ce provides one bonus 3rd-level infusion
and one bonus 4th-level infusion.
Prerequisites: Forge Ring.
Cost to Create: 12,500 gp, 1,000 XP,

mithral—seem to thrum faintly with power.
This item functions as a ring of master
artifi ce, except a greater ring provides you
with one bonus 5th-level infusion and one
bonus 6th-level infusion (instead of one
bonus 3rd-level infusion and one bonus
4th-level infusion).

Weight: —
This white gold ring bears a square-cut ruby.
Arcane runes are inscribed around its band.
A ring of mystic defi ance protects you from
damaging magical effects. When you activate
the ring, you ignore up to 10 points of
damage dealt by a spell or spell-like ability.
You can activate the ring after you learn
the damage a spell or spell-like ability
will deal to you, but before the damage is
actually dealt. This ability functions three
times per day.
This ability does not protect you from
other magical effects (such as those
generated by magic items, unless they
specifi cally mimic spells). For example,
the ring wouldn’t protect you from the
extra damage dealt by a fl aming sword,
but it would protect you from a fi reball cast
from a scroll, wand, or other item.
If you also wear a magic item that
grants an enhancement bonus to your
Intelligence or Charisma, you can add
half that item’s bonus as an insight bonus
on your Fortitude saves against spells
and spell-like abilities (up to a maximum
bonus of +3). This is a continuous effect
and requires no activation.
Prerequisites: Forge Ring, spell immunity.

which are renewed each day at dawn.
Spending 1 or more charges grants a bonus
to the amount of damage you deal with

of your turn. (If the fi re spell doesn’t normally
deal fi re damage, this expenditure
has no effect).
1 charge: +2d6 fi re damage.

3 charges: +4d6 fi re damage.
Prerequisites: Forge Ring, fi reball or
fl ame strike.

Weight: —
This simple gold band looks like a tiny armored
girdle set with small spheres of silver.
A ring of spell-battle informs you of all spellcasting
that occurs within 60 feet of you,
as well as allowing you to attempt a Spellcraft
check (DC 15 + spell level) to identify
the spell being cast (even if you can’t see
its casting or effect). This is a continuous
effect and requires no activation.
Once per day, when you succeed in
identifying a spell in this manner, you
can activate the ring to counterspell that
spell as if with dispel magic, or change the
target of the spell to any target within 60
feet of you. If you choose an illegal target
(because of the spell’s range limitation
or other restrictions), the spell functions
normally and the effect is wasted.

The coal-colored cloth of this robe is decorated
with crimson-stitched runes. The runes run
around the bottom and up the length of the garment
in meandering lines, and are a mixture of
arcane formulas and praises to fi re written in
Ignan. The robe emits a faint odor of brimstone,
and a gentle warmth surrounds it.
While you wear this robe, it provides
you with a +4 armor bonus to AC. This
is a continuous effect and requires no
activation.
The robe can also be activated as a swift
(command) action by speaking a word in
Ignan that causes four fi ery orbs, each
about 6 inches in diameter, to spring from
the sleeves. They circle slowly around
your body at waist height as long as the
robe remains active, but don’t interfere
with your actions in any way. As long as
they are active, they collectively provide
light equal to that of a torch and grant you
resistance to fi re 10.
Two times per day, you can send one of
the fi ery orbs streaking toward a single
enemy within 60 feet as a ranged touch
attack, which is a standard (command)
action. Failure means the orb misses and
explodes harmlessly in a shower of sparks.
Success means it explodes in a 5-footradius
burst around the target, dealing 8d6
points of fi re damage and leaving affected
creatures dazzled for 1 round (Refl ex
DC 16 halves the damage and negates the
dazzled condition).

Price (Item Level): 40,000 gp (17th)
Body Slot: Throat
Caster Level: 15th
Aura: Strong; (DC 22) transmutation
Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: —
This broad adamantine necklace bears a
scarab of the same metal, polished to a mirrorlike
sheen.
A scarab of invulnerability provides you with
brief but complete protection from all forms
of damage. For 1 round after activating
the scarab, you are immune to all forms of
damage (including ability damage), whether
from weapons, spells, psionic powers,
poison, environmental effects, or any other
cause. The scarab doesn’t protect you from
harmful effects that don’t deal damage.
A scarab of invulnerability functions once
per day. You must wear a scarab of invulnerability
for 24 hours before you can access its
abilities. If it is taken off, it becomes inactive
until worn for an additional 24 hours.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

Body Slot: Throat
Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) evocation
Activation: —
Weight: —
This solid gold scarab has obsidian chips for
eyes. Glyphs of protection and health are
carved into its carapace. A button at the base
of its abdomen makes its legs clench or release,
allowing it to be worn as a cloak clasp or a
decorative piece of jewelry.
If your hit points drop below 0 but you are
still alive (above –10 hit points), a scarab
of stabilization automatically stabilizes
you. You are still unconscious from your
wounds, but you need not make a stabilization
check each round to prevent further
hit point loss. If another wound causes
your hit points to drop lower, the scarab
automatically stabilizes you again at your
new hit point total, provided that it is still
between –1 and –9.
If a wound would drop you to –10 hit
points or lower, the secondary power of
the scarab activates automatically. You do
not die, but your hit point total becomes
–1, and you automatically stabilize. This
power functions only once—the scarab
crumbles into dust as soon as this ability
is used.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, contingency,
cure light wounds.

SOULSTONE
Price (Item Level): 10,000 gp (12th)

Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) transmutation
Activation: —; see text
Weight: —
This faceted gemstone is the size of a coin and
mounted on a golden disk covered in runes
and scrollwork.
Soulstones are boons to all those who channel
the power of incarnum (see Magic
of Incarnum). When you use the proper
command thought, this gem adheres to
the center of your forehead (the same
command thought causes the soulstone to
disengage). While you wear a soulstone, you
can bind a soulmeld to your brow chakra,
gaining the normal ability granted by
such a bind. This effect functions despite
the fact that you are currently wearing a
magic item in that chakra. This bind is
in addition to any binds you are already
allowed (though it doesn’t let you bind an
extra soulmeld to your brow chakra).
If you are already able to bind soulmelds
to your brow chakra, the soulstone
instead grants you 1 bonus essentia that
can be invested only in a soulmeld bound
to your brow chakra.
If you also wear a magic item that grants
an enhancement bonus to your Wisdom,
a soulstone also allows you to unshape a
soulmeld bound to your brow chakra and
immediately reshape another soulmeld,
even binding it to your brow chakra if you
want. This ability requires a full-round
action and functions once per day.

SPARE HAND
Price (Item Level): 12,000 gp (13th)
Body Slot: Waist
Caster Level: 11th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) transmutation
Activation: —
Weight: 5 lb.
This strange item consists of an animated arm
and three-fi ngered claw attached to a heavy
leather belt reinforced with strips of metal.
As its most basic function, a spare hand
can grasp or carry any object you could
normally carry in one hand, freeing your
normal hands for other tasks. A spare hand
can hold magic items such as wands and
rods for easy access, but you cannot activate
those items while they are so held.
Transferring an item to or from a spare
hand is a free action.
Whenever your spare hand is
not carrying an item, you gain a
+2 competence bonus on Climb,
Escape Artist, and grapple checks.
Without further augmentation
from an infusion (see below), a
spare hand cannot do anything
other than hold an item—it cannot
wield a weapon, retrieve a stored
item, or perform any other task.
If you power a spare hand with a
1st-level infusion (see the EBERRON
Campaign Setting), it gains additional
qualities. Once per round,
you can command the hand to
stow an item or retrieve a stowed
item (including a weapon) as a
free action.
If you instead expend a 2nd-level
infusion, the spare hand gains the
above ability and can also hold
a buckler or light shield, freeing
your normal hand while still
providing a bonus to AC from the
shield. You still incur any armor
check penalty or other drawbacks
of holding the shield, and are subject
to normal penalties if you are
not profi cient with the shield.
If you expend a 3rd-level infusion, a

with a dwarf or a goblin, but not with
an ogre or a cat). If the other creature
is unwilling to trade positions, it is
allowed a DC 13 Will save to negate
the effect. Each creature can bring along
objects weighing up to its maximum load,
but additional creatures can’t be brought
along.
This ability functions three times

CHAPTER 3
CLOTHING
This black iron torc bears a ruby that seems to
weep tears of blood.
A vampire torc allows you to heal your
own wounds when you deal damage to an
enemy. When you activate this
torc, the next successful melee
attack you make before the end
of your turn also heals you of an amount
of damage equal to half the damage your
attack dealt. This ability functions equally
well regardless of your creature type. If
you don’t deal damage with a melee attack
before the end of your turn, that activation
of the torc is wasted.
This ability functions two times per
day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
vampiric touch.
Cost to Create: 2,500 gp, 200 XP, 5 days.
VANGUARD TREADS
Price (Item Level): 3,100 gp (8th)
Body Slot: Feet
Caster Level: 3rd
Aura: Faint; (DC 16) transmutation
Activation: —
Weight: 2 lb.
These massive boots have spiked, treaded soles
and look large enough to fi t a heavily armored
ogre. A row of inset amethysts runs around
the top cuff.
Vanguard treads provide you with superior
traction and stability, which provides the
following effects:
• You can move through diffi cult terrain
(such as rubble, undergrowth,
steep slopes, stairs, or snow) at normal
speed and without suffering any other
impairment.
• You are unaffected by slippery ice, wet
stones, or other surfaces where traction
is a problem.
• You gain a +8 bonus on attempts to
resist bull rushes and a +4 bonus on
grapple checks to resist a grapple
attempt if that grapple would move you
into another square.
Areas that have been magically manipulated
to impede movement (such as by an
entangle spell) still affect you, as do water,
quicksand, and other nonsolid surfaces.
You still have to slow down for narrow
paths requiring Balance checks and for
surfaces steep enough to require Climb
checks.
If the terrain deals damage (such as the
burning ground on the Elemental Plane
of Fire), you still take that damage.
The massive spikes and treads on the
soles of vanguard treads leave a distinctive
trail. Anyone following you gains a
+10 circumstance bonus on Survival and
Search checks made to track you.
Lore: Ancient giants made the fi rst
vanguard treads to aid their scouts in
navigating diffi cult terrain and hazards
(Knowledge [arcana] DC 15).
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
spider climb.
Cost to Create: 1,550 gp, 124 XP, 4 days.

Price (Item Level): 2,500 gp (7th)
Body Slot: Shoulders
Caster Level: 3rd
Aura: Faint; (DC 16) illusion
Activation: Standard (mental)
Weight: 1 lb.
This silk cloak is seamless—a single sheet of
gossamer, gray fabric.
A vanisher cloak allows you and nearby
allies to briefl y disappear from sight. A
cloak has 3 charges, which are renewed
each day at dawn. Spending 1 or more
charges turns you (and perhaps one or
more allies) invisible, as the invisibility
spell, for 1 or more rounds.
1 charge: You become invisible for 4
rounds.
2 charges: You and one adjacent ally
become invisible for 3 rounds.
3 charges: You and up to three adjacent
allies become invisible for 2 rounds.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
invisibility.

Weight: —
Dyed in swirls of pink and purple, this semitransparent
veil looks like the garb of a sultan’s
harem dancer.

enchantment spells or spell-like abilities,
as well as the Charisma-based save DCs
of your extraordinary or supernatural
abilities, by 2.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
eagle’s splendor.
Cost to Create: 7,000 gp, 560 XP,

VEST OF THE
ARCHMAGI
Price (Item Level): 200,000 gp (25th)
Body Slot: Torso
Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25) no school
Activation: — and swift (command)
Weight: 2 lb.
This gold-brocaded, burgundy garment seems
fi t to be worn by the gods themselves.
The vest of the archmagi is legendary. It
fi lls the dreams of every apprentice sent
to clean the inkpots and dust the tomes,
but rumors of this item are unfounded.
Whispering in the bunkrooms of the
Academy at night, after the oil lamps are
quenched and curfew has long passed,
eager apprentices claim that a vest of the
archmagi provides its wearer with continuous
defensive bonuses equivalent to
the most potent bracers of armor (+8 armor
bonus to AC) and cloak of resistance (+5 resistance
bonus on saving throws).
It is also said that the vest provides
its wearer with the continuous ability
to overcome the magical defenses of her
enemies (+2 enhancement bonus on caster
level checks made to overcome spell resistance),
and that it allows him to recall up
to three arcane spells that he had previously
prepared and cast (as a pearl of power,
except that it can be used for any spell up
to 9th level and activating it requires only
a swift action).
Finally, it is suggested, the wearer of
the vest of the archmagi could expend a
prepared arcane spell or spell slot to heal
himself of damage equal to fi ve times the
Unicorn pendant

level of the spell so expended. This act
requires but a moment’s thought (a swift
action), and can be repeated as often as
desired throughout the day.
Sadly, these stories obviously have no
basis in reality, for such an item would
undoubtedly be prized above all others
by any mage with the resources to craft
one. Of course, as a thing of myth, the
vest of the archmagi can’t be created. But if
it could, it might possibly have the following
prerequisites and costs.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
wish.
Cost to Create: 100,000 gp, 8,000 XP,
200 days.
VEST OF DEFENSE
Price (Item Level): 2,000 gp (6th)
Body Slot: Torso
Caster Level: 3rd
Aura: Faint; (DC 16) transmutation
Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
This snug-fi tting vest is crafted from the skin
of a huge tan-and-black snake.
A vest of defense improves your ability to
dodge attacks. When activated, this vest
improves the dodge bonus to AC granted
by fi ghting defensively, the total defense
action, or the Combat Expertise feat by 2.
Using more than one of these techniques
doesn’t provide more than a +2 bonus. This
bonus lasts for 1 round.
This ability functions three times
per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
cat’s grace.
Cost to Create: 1,000 gp, 80 XP, 2 days.
VEST OF THE
MASTER EVOKER
Price (Item Level): 10,000 gp (12th)
Body Slot: Torso
Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) evocation
Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: 2 lb.
This black silk vest is heavy with moonstone
and jacinth beadwork sewn into arcane patterns
on the back.
Crackling with power, a vest of the
master evoker intensifi es arcane evocation
spells you cast. Many an ambitious
evoker sees gaining this vest as a rite
of passage, much like casting his fi rst
magic missile or fi reball, and among elite
warmages (CAr 10) it serves as an unparalleled
status symbol.
Three times per day, you can activate the
vest to enhance the next arcane evocation
spell you cast before the end of your turn.
That spell deals additional damage equal
to twice its spell level, and the save DC of
the spell increases by 2. This damage is of
the same type as normal for the spell (or,
if the spell deals more than one type of
damage, of any one of those types at your
discretion). If the spell doesn’t normally
deal damage, this use of the vest has no
effect.
In addition, you can apply the effect
of any sudden metamagic feat (CAr 83)
you know to any evocation spell you cast
from a wand or staff as if you were casting
the spell yourself. Doing this requires
no activation, but uses up that feat’s daily
Vestments of ebonsilk use as normal.

Weight: 1 lb.
These lightweight black robes are covered in
a silvery spiderweb tracery. The clasp at the
neck is a silver brooch shaped like a spider
with amethyst eyes.
Thus far, the only known vestments of
ebonsilk have been found in the possession
of drow clerics. If you are chaotic evil,
neutral evil, or chaotic neutral, wearing
these vestments grants you a +2 resistance
bonus on saving throws.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, the vestments
also grant you a continual spider
climb effect.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Lolth and either sacrifi ce a 4th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 7 HD. If you sacrifi ce a
7th-level spell slot or have at least 13 HD
and the True Believer feat, you also gain a
continual freedom of movement effect.
Lore: Said to be woven from silk
extruded by Lolth herself, vestments
of ebonsilk are occasionally awarded to
undeserving followers of Lolth as a test
to see how quickly her favored clerics
can appropriate them (Knowledge [religion]
DC 20).

Sanctify Relic, freedom of movement, spider
climb.

Activation: See text
Weight: —
This golden chain bracelet has a number
of small metal objects hanging from it like
charms.
A wand bracelet can store up to four items,
which appear as charms along the bracelet.
You can grab one of the charms from the
bracelet as a swift (manipulation) action,
causing it to appear in your hand.
If you have an item in hand, you can
use a move (manipulation) action to store
the item in the bracelet or to switch a
held item for a stored item by touching
the item to the charm representing the
stored item. Storing an item causes it to
shrink down and appear as a charm hanging
from the bracelet. Any item stored
can weigh no more than 3 pounds and
must be able to be held in one hand, such
as a wand or a light weapon. Only the
wearer of the bracelet is able to retrieve
or store items.
Lore: The name wand bracelet describes
the most common use of this item. Originally
designed to hold small keepsakes
as charms, and crafted to be appropriate
for formal gatherings, wand bracelets
have found popularity among artifi cers
(ECS 29) who favor spell trigger devices
(Knowledge [history] DC 15).
These bracelets are also sometimes
known as assassins’ charms, because small
weapons can easily be concealed within
them (Knowledge [history] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
shrink item.

Activation: — and standard (command)

cut to overlap a wearer’s chest and arms. An
open white palm in a circle adorns the right
breast, and a rampant purple dragon rages
on the left.
A war wizard cloak protects you from the
elements (as endure elements) and also
activates a feather fall effect on you automatically
if you fall more than 5 feet.
This is a continuous effect and requires
no activation.
In addition, this cloak has four other
abilities, each of which can be activated
once per day: dimension door, mage armor,

globe of light that hovers at your shoulder
and sheds light as a torch. The light

Caster Level: 10th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 20) conjuration
Activation: — and immediate

Weight: 1 lb.
This sailcloth cloak’s elaborate embroidery
evokes the waves of the sea. Within the pattern
of the waves, a repeating swirl of thread
matches the symbol writhing within the large,
dark crystal shard that forms the clasp at the
neck of the cloak. The cloak appears damp,
and the lower edge looks as though it has been
soaked in water.
Despite its damp appearance, a water cloak
always feels completely dry to its wearer,
even in pouring rain. This cloak grants
you a +5 bonus on Refl ex saves against
any effect that deals fi re damage and
allows you to avoid fi re damage as if you
had evasion. Whenever you make a successful
Refl ex saving throw against any
fi re effect that deals half damage on a successful
save, you instead take no damage.
This is a continuous effect and requires
no activation.
In addition, a water cloak offers two
other activated abilities.
Extinguish: The cloak extinguishes
all nonmagical fi res within 30 feet. This
ability has no effect on fi re creatures. It
functions fi ve times per day.
Counterfi re: The cloak can counter
any spell with the fi re descriptor (as if
you were casting dispel magic). This ability
functions once per day. Attempting to
counter a spell that doesn’t have the fi re
descriptor wastes the effect.
Prerequisites: Bind Elemental (ECS 51) or
Craft Wondrous Item, planar binding.
Cost to Create: 6,000 gp, 480 XP,

Many a diplomat wears a wink brooch to

even your best weapon isn’t enough to see you through
the dangers lurking in dank swamps and dark dungeons.
Any successful hero can undoubtedly point
to the times when he reached
into his backpack and pulled
out the perfect tool for the unbelievable
situation at hand.
The following pages include over 300
such magic items: wondrous devices
meant to give you an edge at just the
right time. Though these tools are not as ubiquitous as the
armor or magic amulet you wear every day, or the weapon
you swing every round, experienced adventurers recognize
that a tool needn’t be useful in every encounter for it
to be worth bringing along. Whether
as mundanely functional as a bag of
holding or as explosively exciting as a
strand of lightning, the magic items in
this category are an important part
of your arsenal.

DESCRIPTIONS
The items in this chapter are arranged

ABERRANT SPHERE
Price (Item Level): 2,800 gp (7th)
Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 7th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 18) conjuration
Activation: Full-round (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
The surface of this sphere seems to constantly
fl ash with words in your native tongue, but you
can’t make out what they say.
Created by alienists (CAr 21) and other
cultists who worship aberrant entities, an
aberrant sphere allows its wielder to summon
creatures from beyond space and time at the
cost of a fraction of his own sanity. A sphere
has 3 charges, which are renewed each day
at dawn. Spending 1 or more charges causes
the sphere to shatter, as it summons a particular
kind of aberration, which appears
anywhere within 30 feet of you and serves
you (as summon monster I) for 7 rounds. You
also take a penalty on your Will saves as
long as the creature is present.
1 charge: Summons a choker; –1 penalty
on Will saves.
2 charges: Summons a grick; –2 penalty
on Will saves.
3 charges: Summons a carrion
crawler; –3 penalty on Will saves.
At the end of the duration (or
when the creature is destroyed),
the sphere re-forms in your hand
(or at your feet if your hands are
full) and the penalty on your Will
saves disappears.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous
Item, summon monster IV.

Aura: Strong; (DC 22) conjuration,

Activation: — and swift (command)
Weight: 3 lb.
This teakwood lap harp is slender and graceful,
its strings made of silver wire. An engraved
design depicting waves and fog graces the
wood.
This masterwork harp grants you a +2
circumstance bonus on Perform (string
instruments) checks. If you have at least
12 ranks in Perform (string instruments),
you can also command it to produce one
of three spell effects (control water, mass
cure light wounds, or mind fog), each once
per day.
If you pick up an Anstruth harp but do
not have 12 or more ranks in Perform
(string instruments), the instrument
bestows one negative level on you, which
persists for as long as you hold it. This
negative level never results in actual level
loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way
(including restoration spells) while the
instrument is held.
Lore: A wise and powerful bard named
Falataer reportedly created the fi rst of
these instruments, which he used to test
and reward the students at all seven levels
of his bardic college. Others have since
copied the designs but honored Falataer
by keeping the name Anstruth harp
(Knowledge [arcana] or bardic knowledge
DC 15).
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
control water, mass cure light wounds, mind
fog, bard.

This set of picks, pins, and levers is housed in
a supple leather bag decorated with arcane
runes.
This set of masterwork thieves’ tools is
the perfect accessory if you depend on a
blend of magic and skill to achieve your
thieving goals. In addition to granting
the normal +2 circumstance bonus on
Disable Device and Open Lock checks,
these tools can grant a character with the
trapfi nding class feature a special benefi t.
When activating the tools, you can expend
an arcane spell or arcane spell slot of 1st
level or higher to gain a +5 competence
bonus on either a Disable Device check
or an Open Lock check begun before the
end of that turn.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) conjuration
Activation: Standard (manipulation)
Weight: —
This elegant, stoppered glass bottle holds a dark,
viscous fl uid.
One round after you apply this elixir to
your skin, it creates an invisible cloud of
gas in a 10-foot radius that moves with you
and persists for 1 minute. You are immune
to the cloud’s effects, but every other
creature in the area that has 3 Hit Dice or
fewer immediately dies (no save). A creature
that has 4–6 Hit Dice must succeed
on a DC 17 Fortitude save each round it
remains in the area or die. A creature that
has 7 Hit Dice or more takes 1d4 points of
Constitution damage (Fort DC 17 half)
per round of exposure.
If you open the bottle but do not immediately
apply the liquid, the cloud of gas
spreads to fi ll a 5-foot-radius area, centered
on the opened bottle or the place where
the liquid was poured out. This cloud persists
for 1 minute.

This cut crystal bottle is fi lled with silvery
liquid. The bottle’s stopper is a single piece of
smoky quartz.
One round after you apply this elixir to
your skin, it creates an invisible cloud of
gas in a 10-foot radius that moves with you

to the cloud’s effects, but each round at the
end of your turn every other creature in
the area with 10 Hit Dice or fewer must

fall asleep for 1 minute. Furthermore, each
creature remaining in the area 1 round
later (whether already asleep or not) must
make a second successful DC 14 Fortitude
save or fall asleep for 1 hour. Creatures
with more than 10 Hit Dice are immune
to the effect.
If you open the bottle but do not immediately
apply the liquid, the cloud of gas
spreads to fi ll a 5-foot-radius area, centered

Body Slot: — (held) or shoulders
Caster Level: 3rd
Aura: Faint; (DC 16) enchantment
Activation: —
Weight: 2 lb. (12 lb. if backpack frame
worn)
This banner is a rectangular military standard
depicting a white, two-tailed swirl—like a stylized
overhead view of a hurricane—on a dark
green background. The banner’s fl uttering
movements seem slower than they should be.
An unfurled banner of the storm’s eye always

movement of its bearer.
As long as it is held aloft, the banner
automatically suppresses (but does not
dispel) fear effects on all creatures within
20 feet. It also prevents any creature
within 20 feet from becoming confused
or stunned.
Alternatively, you can mount the
banner on a backpack frame to leave
your hands free. The backpack frame
costs 5 gp and weighs 10 pounds. While
so mounted, the banner occupies your
shoulders body slot.

destroying the blast disk and dealing 5d6
points of fi re damage to all creatures
and objects within 10 feet (Refl ex DC 14
half).
If set to explode through proximity,
a blast disk must be set down in a square

Dozens of smaller glass spheres comprise this

When you activate a set of blast globes, the
transparent globes separate and begin
circling each other. One round after they
activate, you can direct the globes to strike
(as a group) any location within 400 feet
as a free action. The globes then move to
that location and create an explosion in
a 20-foot-radius spread. Any creature in
the area takes 10d6 points of fi re damage
and 2d6 points of sonic damage, is deafened
for 2d6 rounds, and is pushed 1d6
squares away from the center of the blast.
A successful DC 15 Refl ex save halves the
fi re damage and negates the push, while
a successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates
the deafening effect.
After exploding, the globes reform in
your hands or at your feet (if your hands
are full). This ability functions once per

evil, you can see through as if it
weren’t there.
Filling the censer is a standard

the proper divine connection, you can
burn other kinds of gem dust in the
censer to produce additional effects, as
detailed on the table below. In each case,
the cloud produced is the same size as
the one produced by the quartz dust and
behaves in the same way, except as noted
on the table. You are always unaffected by
the cloud created.

COGNIZANCE CRYSTAL
Price (Item Level): See text
Body Slot: —
Caster Level: See table
Aura: See table; (DC varies) evocation
Activation: Free (mental)
Weight: 1 lb.
Silver wire gently encloses and binds a large
core crystal and several smaller crystals in a
geometric design. The aquamarine crystals
emit a faint glow.
A cognizance crystal stores power points,
which the holder can use to manifest
a psionic power she knows (instead of
spending points from her own power
pool). You cannot directly replenish your
personal power points from those stored
in a cognizance crystal, nor can you draw
power points from more than one source
to manifest a power (even if that second
source is your own power pool).
A cognizance crystal can store only as
many power points as its original maximum,
set at the time of its creation. When
a crystal’s power points are used up, the
glow of the crystal dims. A user can
recharge it by paying power points on a
1-for-1 basis (a standard [mental] action).
While doing this depletes the user’s own
power point reserve for the day, those
power points remain available in the
crystal until used.
Before you can use a cognizance crystal,
you must hold or have it on your person
for at least 10 continuous minutes.
A typical cognizance crystal has AC 7,
10 hit points, hardness 8, and a break
DC of 16.

Caster Level: 13th
Aura: Strong; (DC 21) abjuration
Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: 3 lb.
Each end of this slender ebony rod is set with
a clear, jagged crystal. A wild energy seems to
fl icker in the depths of these stones, and gazing
intently into one reveals minute fl ares of fi re,
tiny sparks of electricity, and other glimpses of
suppressed energy.
Conduit rods alter the fundamental ways
in which magical energies interact. When
you activate a conduit rod and specify an
energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fi re,
or sonic), your existing resistance
to energy of the chosen
type increases by 20. This
protection also extends to
every creature adjacent
to you (though the value
is based on the value of
the energy resistance of
those creatures rather
than your own) and lasts
for 1 round. The rod has no
effect on creatures that are
immune to the chosen energy
type or have no resistance to
it at all.
This ability functions three
times per day.

with aid for their journeys. For as long as
you possess the cornucopia, you can withdraw
one fruit from it every morning (roll
d% each morning to determine the kind
of fruit obtained), provided that you are
lawful good, neutral good, or lawful neutral.
When consumed by such a character
(a standard action), this fruit has an effect
based on its type, as given in the table.
Each fruit disappears after 24 hours if
not eaten. The following morning, the
cornucopia again yields one fruit.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, a cornucopia
of the needful contains 1d4+1 fruits each
morning (roll d% and consult the table for
each) rather than only one. As before, the
cornucopia once again yields 1d4+1 fruits
the following morning, regardless of how
many were withdrawn and consumed.
To use the relic power, you must
worship Yondalla and either sacrifi ce a
6th-level divine spell slot or have the True

multiple acorns.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Ehlonna and either sacrifi ce an 8th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 15 HD.

Activation: Swift (command)
Weight: —
This fl at black square looks like a piece of silken
cloth, folded many times upon itself. Fleeting
images of creatures and objects fl it across the
surface of the fabric.
Kobolds are among the fi nest trapmakers
in the world, but this portable pit trap
exceeds even their expertise. If you are
lawful evil, lawful neutral, or neutral evil,
an enveloping pit functions like a portable
hole, except that it is 50 feet deep.
An enveloping pit covers a 10-foot square
when opened fully, but the opening can
be as small as 1 foot in diameter if it is
laid upon the ground while still folded.
The pit opens fully only if it has enough
fl at space to do so; it stops opening when
an edge hits a wall or an obstruction of
similar size.
Relic Power: If you have established the
proper divine connection, you can open
or close an enveloping pit with a command
word from anywhere within 60 feet.
A favorite kobold tactic is to lie in wait
until foes are standing close to a concealed
enveloping pit, then give the command
word to open it. Any creature that
suddenly fi nds an enveloping pit beneath
it falls in. A successful DC 22 Refl ex save
allows the creature to move to an adjacent
safe square, if one exists.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Kurtulmak and either sacrifi ce a
5th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 9 HD.
Lore: Centuries ago, Kurtulmak gave
his high priests a half-dozen of these
portable pit traps to aid them in acquiring
new lands and wealth (Knowledge

You need not hold an essentia
jewel to activate it, but you must
keep it somewhere on your body

example).
Lore: Essentia jewels are mined
from enormous crystalline structures
on the Positive Energy Plane

An eternal wand functions two times

Lore: During the fi nal years of the last
great war, the artifi cers and wizards of a
powerful noble family perfected a new
form of wand built around a crystal shard
(Knowledge [history] DC 10).
The development of the eternal wand
allowed lesser arcanists to take the place
of war wizards during the fi nal days of
the last great war, supplementing their
passive spells with more aggressive magic
(Knowledge [history] DC 15).
While the artifi cers have been searching
for ways to streamline the process
of creation, the technique is still in its
infancy. Currently, the wands are rarely
seen except in military units, but a few
soldiers who served in the war brought
their eternal wands of magic missile home
from the front lines (Knowledge [history]

This rolled-up sheet of vellum is generally kept

danger and make their way through the
wilderness. While holding the map, you
gain a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge
(geography) and Survival checks if
you are neutral good, lawful good, chaotic
good, or neutral.
Relic Power: Once per day, if you have
established the proper divine connection,
you can command a
map of unseen lands
to spend 2 minutes
redrawing itself. Doing
so causes it to map the
terrain within a
10-mile radius with total accuracy but
only middling detail. This ability doesn’t
function underground.
When the redraw command is issued,
the DM should spend no more than 2
minutes of real time sketching out a map,
adding items from the following list in the
given order of priority.
• General terrain features (mountains,
rivers, and so forth), labeled if their
names are widely known.
• Structures encompassing more than
5,000 square feet (castles, temples, and
ruins), named either specifi cally (“Fortress
of the Undying”) or generally
(“bardic college”).
• Structures important for travel (bridges,
dungeon entrances, and magic portals),
labeled only if they are unusual in some
respect.
• Lairs of creatures of CR 12 or higher,
labeled by creature type only.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Yondalla and either sacrifi ce a 5th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 9 HD.
Lore: The fi rst map of unseen lands was
sketched out by Fharlanghn as a gift for
Yondalla. Since then, she has occasionally
given one to a large tribe of halfl ings
intending to strike out for new territory
(Knowledge [religion] DC 20).

CHAPTER 4
TOOLS
A fl ying creature affected by a pearl of
brain lock is allowed to descend to the nearest
safe, level area rather than be dazed,
while a swimmer incapable of breathing
water is allowed to head directly for the
surface. In either case, the creature is
dazed for the remaining duration once it
has reached safety.
Once activated, a pearl is expended and
cannot be used again.

PEARL OF
BREATH CRISIS
Price (Item Level): 2,000 gp (6th)

Activation: Standard (thrown)
Weight: —
A draconic rune representing the body has been
carefully engraved on this small pearl.
You can hurl a pearl of breath crisis as a
ranged touch attack with a range increment
of 10 feet. If it strikes a humanoid
that fails a DC 14 Will saving throw, the
pearl seems to impact and then enter
the fl esh of the creature, compelling it
to purge itself of breath. For the next
5 rounds, the creature can continue to
breathe only by taking a standard action
each round to do so. This is a mind-affecting
ability.
At the end of each of the target’s turns
in which it chooses not to consciously
take a breath, it must succeed on a DC 14
Fortitude save or begin to suffocate, falling
to 0 hit points and potentially dying
in later rounds (DMG 304), as long as the
duration continues. If the effect ends
before a suffocating creature has died, the
creature is no longer considered to
be suffocating.
Once activated, a pearl is
expended and cannot be used
again.

Item, suggestion or crisis of breath
(EPH 89).

A brightly colored oasis complete with fruitbearing
desert trees and bright blue water
covers the surface of this woven blanket. It
smells slightly of old incense.
When you unroll this 10-foot-by-10-foot
blanket and activate it, a 5-foot-by-10-foot
tent springs from the blanket, along with
a campfi re, a bowl of dates, and a gallon of
cool water. The tent functions in all ways
as a Leomund’s tiny hut spell. The campfi re
burns continuously, never needing fuel,
and the dates provide enough food to sustain
a person for one day. When you speak
the command word again, a personal oasis
rolls back up into blanket form.
A personal oasis functions once per day
for up to 10 hours.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

PIPES OF FRENZIED
REVELRY [RELIC]
Price (Item Level): 3,100 gp (8th)
Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25) enchantment
Activation: Standard (manipulation)
Weight: 1 lb.
This set of pan pipes is made of hollowed-out
reeds lashed together with sturdy vines. Somewhere
on the surface of each reed is the symbol
of Olidammara.
When you play these pipes, you gain a
+5 competence bonus on Perform (wind
instruments) checks if you are chaotic
neutral, neutral, chaotic good, or chaotic
evil.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, you can
attempt a DC 25 Perform (wind instruments)
check each round that you are
playing the pipes. If you succeed, every
living creature within 30 feet must make
a successful DC 16 Will save or be affected
as if by a confusion spell, with one exception:
Whenever the die roll calls for the
subject to attack another creature, the
subject instead makes a mildly amorous
advance (such as an embrace or kiss)
toward the target creature. For each
affected creature, this effect lasts as long
as the piping continues (a standard action
each round) and you are within 30 feet of
that creature at the end of your turn. If
your playing is interrupted, or you fail a
Perform check and then resume piping
with a successful check, every creature
within 30 feet can make a new save
attempt. Subjects that successfully save
are immune to the pipes of frenzied revelry
for the next 24 hours.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Olidammara and either sacrifi ce a
5th-level divine spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 9 HD.
Lore: These pipes were originally created
by a secretive order of bard/clerics
devoted to Olidammara. For the past several
centuries, members of the order have
distributed them to musically inclined
followers of the deity (Knowledge [religion]
DC 15).
Rumor holds that a satyr named Elovan
came into possession of a set of these
pipes and used them to woo a fair
princess while she was on a picnic
in the woods with her court. Since
then, members of that nation’s royal
family have occasionally displayed
odd physical quirks, such as unusually
hairy legs and vestigial horns,
as well as an unusual aptitude
for music (Knowledge [religion]
DC 20).

Sanctify Relic, confusion.

PSYCHOACTIVE SKIN
This fi st-sized blob of murky ectoplasm shimmers
faintly in the light.
Once a psychoactive skin is donned, the
ball unfolds, extends, and surrounds a
Medium or smaller wearer’s entire body
in a variegated second skin, granting the
wearer access to a particular array of abilities
(see below). Donning a psychoatcive
skin requires a mental command as a
standard action.
A deployed skin completely covers the
wearer and all his equipment, but allows
him to see, hear, and breathe normally. It
rolls away from various parts of the body
as needed, such as when the
wearer needs to eat or access a
backpack. Held items or items
specifi cally excluded are not
covered up.
Up to three skins can be worn
simultaneously, although
only the outermost is

skins cannot be activated
or accessed). Skin layers
can be changed as a standard

the desired lower-layer skin to
come to the surface.

Weight: 5 lb.
This bundle of rough parchment contains
scraps of varying shapes and sizes; some appear
old and others new. It is bound with a braided
cord and secured with a medallion bearing the
holy symbol of Wee Jas.
Scrolls of uncertain provenance are not
spells stored in written form, but collections
of death-obsessed writings in
an unknown hand. Popular myth holds
that those who can command the lore
contained in a set of these scrolls have
power over life and death. As long as
you possess scrolls of uncertain provenance,
you gain a +5 competence bonus on
Knowledge checks, provided that you
are lawful neutral, lawful evil, lawful
good, or neutral.
Relic Power: If you have established
a proper divine connection, you can
attempt to read from the scrolls once per
day for 1 hour. Understanding their lore,
however, is not an easy task. To begin
with, the scrolls are written in nearly
every language, ancient and modern, and
the text sometimes switches languages
within the same sentence. Thus, a successful
hour of reading requires a successful
DC 20 Knowledge (religion) check. You
receive a +2 bonus on the check for every
language you speak. So cryptic are the
scrolls that even read magic, comprehend
languages, or other spells don’t help you
understand them, nor does the Decipher
Script skill.
Time Benefit
1 hour Renewal pact for yourself
2 hours Renewal pact for another
3 hours Death pact for yourself
4 hours Death pact for another
6 hours True resurrection for
another (and the scrolls
disappear)
If your check is successful, you gain temporary
understanding of one of the scrolls’
secrets depending on how long you have
spent reading them. Your hours of successful
reading stack for this purpose,
so you can read over multiple
days to gain a greater
benefi t, if desired. The time
spent need not all be spent
at once; you can divide it as
you choose for the purpose
of gaining benefi ts.
Reading scrolls of uncertain provenance
is not without risk, since delving
into their mysteries draws you near to the
border between life and death. Whenever
you spend an hour reading scrolls of
uncertain provenance, you must roll on the
following table, whether or not you learn
anything useful.
d% Effect
01–10 Go insane (as the insanity
spell); Will DC 20 negates.
11–30 The scrolls bestow a
permanent curse upon
you, applying a –4 penalty
on attack rolls, saves,
ability checks, and skill
checks; Will DC 20 negates.
31–60 Receive a geas/quest to
perform for Wee Jas;
Will DC 20 negates.
61–90 Gain 1d6 negative levels
(Fort DC 20 removes them
after 24 hours).
91–100 Become a ghost for a year
and a day; Fort DC 20
negates.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Wee Jas and either sacrifi ce a 6th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 11 HD.

SHARD OF THE SUN

Price (Item Level): 3,500 gp (8th)
Body Slot: — (held)

Aura: Strong; (DC 25) evocation
Activation: — or standard (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
This brightly glowing holy symbol of Pelor is
made of hammered gold and set with small
diamonds.
A shard of the sun is mentioned in several
religious texts as “Pelor’s gift, which I
carry into darkness—a sun that never
sets.” When you hold this item, it continuously
emits a warm light equivalent
to a daylight spell heightened to 5th
level, provided that you are neutral good,
lawful good, chaotic good, or neutral. The
symbol must be covered completely to
douse its light.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, you can
command a shard of the sun to fi re two
simultaneous searing light spells, though
each must be aimed at a different target.
Each beam deals 10d6 points of damage
to undead, 5d6 points to constructs and
objects, and 5d8 points of damage to
other creatures. Creatures particularly
vulnerable to bright light, such as vampires,
take 10d8 points of damage from
these beams. This ability functions three
times per day.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Pelor and either sacrifi ce a 6th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 11 HD. If you sacrifi ce
an 8th-level spell slot or have the True
Believer feat and at least 15 HD, you
can fi re four searing light beams with
each activation (no two at the same
target).
Lore: The fi rst shards of the sun were
hewn by Pelor himself from the orb
of the sun and molded into the
shape of his symbol. Over the
centuries, he gifted them to
his most favored high priests, and
most of them remain in the hands
of his clergy today (Knowledge
[religion] DC 20).

A handful of thick, glassy black sand fi lls this
small lizardskin sack.
When you fl ing slashing sand onto the
ground, it covers an area of up to four contiguous
squares with razor-sharp obsidian
shards for 1 hour (the equivalent of a spike

Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) enchantment
Activation: Standard (manipulation)
Weight: 1/2 lb.
This twisted wooden spike was carved from
the misshapen limb of an ash tree.
A sleeping spike becomes invisible 1 round
after you plant it fi rmly in the ground.
Thereafter, as soon as any creature comes
within 10 feet of it, the spike emits a sleep
effect (Will DC 17 negates) in a 20-footradius
burst that affects all creatures with
10 Hit Dice or fewer. The spike is destroyed
when the sleep effect is triggered.
During the round that a sleeping spike
remains visible after being planted, any
creature can safely remove it from the

throw or be unable to move from
its current space for 1 round. Creatures

However, affected creatures are neither
paralyzed nor entangled, so they can fi ght
and cast spells normally.

CHAPTER 4
TOOLS
The power of a soul anchor prevents all
voluntary movement that would allow
the affected creatures to leave their
respective spaces (including teleportation
magic or other spells and items that
allow movement). However, it does not
preclude involuntary movement, such
as that resulting from a bull rush. If an
affected creature is involuntarily moved
out of its space for any reason, the effect
on that creature ends immediately.
This ability functions fi ve times per
day, but it can’t be activated in consecutive
rounds.
Prerequisites: Craft Rod, hold monster.
Cost to Create: 5,000 gp, 400 XP,
10 days.

Price (Item Level): 700 gp (3rd)
Body Slot: — (held)
Caster Level: 3rd
Aura: Faint; (DC 16) necromancy
Activation: Standard (thrown)
Weight: 1 lb.
This black, fi st-sized orb feels faintly greasy to
the touch.
When you throw a soulvoid orb against a
hard surface, it explodes in a shower of
orange sparks that fi lls a 10-foot-radius
burst. Each creature within that area
is affected as if by a divest essentia spell
(MoI 101).
Lore: Soulvoid orbs were fi rst created by
the githyanki for use in a struggle with a
splinter group of githzerai who had taken
up the practice of meldshaping (Knowledge
[the planes] DC 15).
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
divest essentia.

Activation: Swift (mental)
Weight: 1 lb.
This fi st-sized sphere of crystal is perfectly
clear.
A sphere of awakening allows you to
silently rouse your allies from slumber,
even if magically created. When you
activate the sphere, all allies in a 60-footradius
burst are immediately awakened
from sleep (whether mundane or magical
in origin). In addition, any fatigue
or exhaustion affecting you and those
allies immediately ends. Furthermore,
you and all affected allies gain immunity
to fatigue, exhaustion, and sleep
effects for 10 minutes after the sphere
is activated.
A sphere of awakening functions once
per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, break
enchantment.

Activation: Standard (command)
Weight: 3 lb.
A complex relief of webs and tiny arachnids
covers this silvery rod. Its surface is strangely
sticky to the touch.
A spider rod has two different abilities that
each function three times per day.
Silk Strand: The rod produces an
entangling strand of silk as a ranged
touch attack (range 100 feet). A target hit
by this strand is entangled for 1 minute
(Refl ex DC 20 negates entanglement,
but the creature’s speed is still halved for
the duration of the effect). Treat this as
a net attack, except that the strand has
15 hit points and takes double damage
from fi re.
Poison Touch: You can make a melee
touch attack with the rod to deliver a
virulent contact poison (Fort DC 16, 1d6
Con/1d6 Con).
Prerequisites: Craft Rod, poison, web.
Cost to Create: 7,500 gp, 600 XP,

Caster Level: 9th
Aura: Moderate; (DC 19) conjuration
Activation: —
Weight: 1 lb.
This spool of silk rope comes with a belt loop
so that it can be hung conveniently at the
user’s side.
A spool of endless rope holds an unlimited
amount of the fi nest silk rope.
To use a spool of endless rope, you feed out
as little or as much rope as desired, up to
a maximum of 500 feet at any one time.
When you are fi nished with the rope, you
can simply wind it back onto the spool.
(Feeding out or rewinding requires 1 fullround
action per 50 feet of rope.)
The rope can’t be entirely separated
from the spool, though it can be cut
or broken like a normal silk rope. Any
portion of rope cut away from the spool
disappears instantly.
Rope from a spool of endless rope can be
spliced or knotted together with another
rope (including one from a second spool
of endless rope), but it can’t be wound back
into the spool while so attached.

Caster Level: 3rd
Aura: Faint; (DC 16) necromancy
Activation: Standard (thrown) or
— (ammunition)
Weight: —
This stone reeks of rotting meat.
A stench stone nauseates its target and
sickens those nearby. The stone must
be thrown (range increment 10 feet) or
hurled from a sling (using that weapon’s
normal range increment) as a ranged
attack. If the stone strikes its target, it
deals no damage but bursts into a cloud of
noxious vapor. If a stench stone misses its
target, it is consumed without effect.
Any living creature struck by a stench
stone becomes nauseated for 1 round (Fort
DC 13 negates). Regardless of the success
or failure of the save, the target exudes a
stench for 3 rounds that causes all creatures
within 10 feet of it to be sickened
for the remaining duration of the stench
(Fort DC 13 negates). Creatures immune
to poison are unaffected by stench stones;
any effect that neutralizes or delays
poison also protects against the effect.
Once activated, this item is expended
and cannot be used again.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
ghoul touch.
Cost to Create: 150 gp, 12 XP, 1 day.

large, and the others are in three progressively
smaller pairs. The stones slosh as though fi lled
with liquid.
Each of the seven pearls on this chain
can be detached and thrown up to 50
feet. When a pearl strikes its destination,
it explodes into a 20-foot-radius, 20-
foot-high, cylinder-shaped cloud of acid
centered on the end point. This cloud
deals acid damage to any creature in the
area (Refl ex DC 19 half).
A strand of acid pearls has four different
sizes of pearls, each of which deals a different
amount of acid damage. The two
smallest each deal 3d6 points of damage,
each of the next larger pair deals 5d6

This bronze spike sparks with static electricity.
A stunning spike becomes invisible 1 round
after you plant it fi rmly in the ground.
Thereafter, as soon as any creature comes
within 10 feet of it, the spike bursts into
fragments, stunning all creatures in a
20-foot radius for 1 round (Will DC 20

Weight: 2 lb.
This crudely carved, foot-long wooden rod bears
a vaguely animal visage at its head.
A boon for those who magically conjure
animals to aid them in combat, a summoner’s
totem allows instantaneous enhancement of
your summoned allies. When you summon
a single animal using a summon nature’s ally
spell, you can cast another spell targeting
the summoned creature as a swift action.
The second spell must be no higher than
3rd level, it must target the summoned
creature (and only the summoned creature),
its casting time must be no longer than 1
standard action, and it expends the spell or
spell slot as normal.
For example, immediately after summoning
a brown bear with summon nature’s
ally IV, you could cast bull’s strength upon
that bear as a swift action (as long as you
were adjacent to the bear). You couldn’t use
the totem to cast obscuring mist (since that
spell doesn’t target the bear).
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, speak

TOME OF
ANCIENT LORE [RELIC]
Price (Item Level): 5,500 gp (10th)
Body Slot: —
Caster Level: 20th
Aura: Strong; (DC 25) transmutation
Activation: 1 hour; see text
Weight: 2 lb.
This ancient, leather-bound book is stuffed
to overflowing with yellowing sheets of
parchment.
A boon to arcane spellcasters of all sorts, a
tome of ancient lore contains every conceivable
spell. Perusing it for 1 hour gives you
a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge
(arcana) and Spellcraft checks
made that day, provided that you
are neutral, neutral good, neutral
evil, lawful neutral, or chaotic neutral.
The hour spent studying the
tome is in addition to any time you
spend preparing spells.
Relic Power: Though the pages
of this book contain all the world’s
arcane knowledge, a tome of ancient lore
is cursed with a deliberately confusing,
ever-changing system of cross-referencing.
Because its pages constantly rearrange
themselves, apparently at random, fi nding
any useful information by browsing
the book is impossible. However, if you
have established the proper divine connection,
you can use a tome of ancient lore
while preparing arcane spells to prepare
a single spell that isn’t in your spellbook.
You have a 50% chance
of fi nding any arcane spell of
the highest level you can cast, and
a 100% chance to fi nd any other spell that
you can cast. The book functions in this
manner once per day.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Boccob and either sacrifi ce a 5th-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 9 HD.
Lore: Allegedly penned by Boccob
himself and “borrowed” from his library,
the original tome disappeared for centuries.
Eventually, copies began to appear in
the possession of arcane colleges, spellcasting
dragons, and powerful wizards
(Knowledge [religion] DC 20).

Sanctify Relic, secret page.

Activation: See text
Weight: 5 lb.
This thick, leather-bound manuscript has a
particularly disgusting decoration—a desiccated
tongue nailed to its front cover.
A tome of the stilled tongue is a treasure trove
of arcane potential. If you are neutral evil,
chaotic evil, lawful evil, or neutral, the
book reveals full instructions for creating
a lich’s phylactery and offers 500 blank
spell pages that function like those in
Boccob’s blessed book (DMG 249).
Relic Power: A tome of the stilled tongue
also contains directions for eldritch
mental exercises designed to strengthen
your spellcasting. If you have established
the proper divine connection and read the
appropriate section of the tome (requiring
1 hour of mental exercises), you can
increase your effective caster level for all
spells by 1 for 24 hours. However, because
the exercises are mystically strenuous,
doing them reduces your full normal hit
point total by 1 per character level
while the caster level increase is
in effect. This ability functions
once per day.
To use the relic power, you must
worship Vecna and either sacrifi ce
a 5th-level divine spell slot or
have the True Believer feat and at
least 9 HD.
Lore: The grisly cover decoration
on the original tome of the stilled
tongue once belonged to a former
cleric of Vecna who couldn’t keep
her order’s secrets. Now fi ve copies
are known to exist, but the origins of
the other four tongues have never been
revealed (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).

A tomebound eye of Boccob has 3 charges,
which are renewed each day at dawn.
Spending 1 or more charges when you

2 charges: Gain a +6 competence bonus
on your caster level check to overcome
spell resistance.
3 charges: Gain a +8 competence bonus
on your caster level check to overcome

You can divide the 3 charges between
spells, or spend all three to enhance a
single spell. For example, you could grant
three spells each a +4 bonus, one spell a +6
bonus and another a +4 bonus, or a single
spell a +8 bonus. No spellbook can have

This lantern is elaborately crafted from fl ametouched
iron, burnished to a silvery hue. A
continuous, translucent white fl ame fl ickers
within, though it sheds no heat.
A truelight lantern continually emanates
bright light as a continual fl ame spell.
Its true power can be activated by speaking
the word “reveal” in Celestial. Once
it is activated, a truelight lantern provides
bright illumination in a 60-foot cone and
shadowy illumination for another 60
feet beyond that. Everything within the
60-foot cone of bright illumination can
be seen as if all viewers were under the
effect of a true seeing spell. This effect lasts
for 10 minutes.
A truelight lantern can normally be
activated once per day, but can be
activated additional times if a true
seeing spell is cast into it (overriding
the normal targeting
restriction of the spell). Each
casting of true seeing allows
a lantern to be activated one

magic item set consists of three to six thematically
linked magic items that provide extra bonuses or
effects when worn together. The abilities scale or accumulate
with the number of items worn. A character
gains a particularly potent effect when all the items
of a set are worn or used together.
ARMOR OF THE
WATCHING MASTER
Those who wear the armor of the watching master know what it
feels like to be in command and to sense what others miss. They
possess unnatural sight and unusual powers to blind, burn, and
bully their enemies. Individually, each piece of the armor of the
watching master provides a useful ability, but only those with the
full set know its true powers.
The armor of the watching master works best in the hands of a
barbarian or other melee warrior. As medium armor, a breastplate
of terror allows a barbarian to use his fast movement ability, and
its damage reduction stacks with the barbarian’s. The armor of
the watching master also provides other advantages useful to any
melee-oriented character, such as frightening or blinding foes,
ignoring hardness, and overcoming damage reduction. Note that
the Strength bonus provided by the armor of the watching master
can be increased using the rules in Chapter 6.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge
(the planes), or who have the bardic knowledge ability,
can research the armor of the watching master to learn more
about these items. When a character succeeds on a check,
the following lore is revealed, including the information
from lower DCs.
DC 15: The fi rst set of the armor of the watching master
belonged to a powerful elf paladin who returned from
planar travel wearing the items. The paladin founded an
organization devoted to guardianship and order, and sets of
the armor of the watching master became standard issue for
the highest-ranking members of that group. The organization,
called the Watchful Eyes, collapsed due to internal
strife one hundred years ago, and now sets of this armor
continue to appear from time to time in the hands of various
individuals.
DC 20: The Watchful Eyes collapsed because many
of its paladin members became blackguards at about
the same time that its founder vanished. Lacking leadership
and warring internally, the group eventually
disintegrated.
DC 25: Stories persist that the founder of the organization
was the fi rst to fall from grace, and that she
returned from the planes tainted by evil. The stories don’t
say how she managed to hide this from other members of the

MAGIC ITEM
SETS
Watchful Eyes or why she founded the
group, but supposedly the dark side of the
Watchful Eyes persists as a cultlike order
of barbarians and blackguards who wear
pieces of the armor of the watching master as
a sign of their devotion to the cult.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of the
set. Use this to drive further adventure
and direct the PCs toward some location or
story you would like them to explore.
COLLECTION BENEFITS
Wearing pieces of the armor of the watching
master allows you to command or frighten
foes, blind and burn enemies, or crush
objects that impede your vision. Wearing
the entire set grants you vision that can
pierce invisibility.
When all four pieces of the armor are
worn, the staring eyes marking each item
appear to come to life, becoming bloodshot,
yellow-pupiled orbs that look around
of their own accord.
2 Pieces: You gain a +2 bonus on initiative
checks.
4 Pieces: You gain a +5 competence
bonus on Spot checks. Once per day, you
can speak the command word of “Cabiri”
and activate the armor with a standard
action to gain the effect of a see invisibility
spell for 3 minutes.

Body Slot: Body
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) necromancy
Activation: — and immediate (mental)
Weight: 30 lb.
This adamantine breastplate bears an emblem
of a wide, staring eye surrounded by raised rays
of glittering mithral.
As a +1 adamantine breastplate, this item
grants damage reduction 2/—. A breastplate
of terror’s damage reduction stacks
with damage reduction gained as a class
feature (but not from any other source).
For example, a 10th-level barbarian would
have damage reduction 4/—.
In addition, once per day immediately
after you have been damaged by a melee
attack, you can activate this armor to
render a foe that just wounded you frightened
for 1 round. If the enemy succeeds on
a DC 20 Will save, it is shaken for 1 round
rather than frightened.

Activation: — and swift (command)
Weight: 2 lb.
Each of these spiked steel gauntlets has an
embossed image of an eye on its back. Each eye
has an emerald for a pupil.
Gauntlets of destruction grant you a +2
enhancement bonus to Strength.
In addition, you can activate the gauntlets
to enable the next melee attack made
during your turn to overcome damage
reduction and ignore hardness as if the
attack were made with an adamantine
weapon. This ability functions three
times per day.
Gauntlets of destruction are masterwork
spiked gauntlets and can be used as a
weapon. You can enhance a gauntlet
beyond its base abilities by using the rules
for crafting a magic weapon, but each
gauntlet must be enhanced separately.
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, bull’s strength, shatter, possession
of a piece of the set.
Cost to Create: 3,000 gp (plus 610 gp
for two masterwork spiked gauntlets),

HELM OF
WOUNDING SIGHT
Price (Item Level): 6,500 gp (10th)
Body Slot: Head
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) evocation
Activation: Standard (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
This steel helmet covers all of the wearer’s head
but the face. A single huge eye with a crystal
pupil is embossed on the helm’s forehead.
When a helm of wounding sight is activated,
the embossed pupil sheds light with the
brightness of a light spell until it is commanded
to cease or the helm is removed.
In addition, three times per day, a helm
of wounding sight can be activated to emit
an instantaneous 60-foot-long cone of
bright, burning light. This cone deals
2d6 points of fi re damage and blinds all
creatures in the area for 1 round. Creatures
that succeed on DC 20 Refl ex saves take
half damage and are dazzled for 1 round.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
light, burning hands, possession of a piece
of the set.
Cost to Create: 3,250 gp, 260 XP, 6 days.
MASK OF MASTERY
Price (Item Level): 3,500 gp (8th)
Body Slot: Face
Caster Level: 5th
Aura: Faint; (DC 17) enchantment
Activation: — and standard (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
This steel half-mask covers only the lower
face. Over the wearer’s mouth, an emblem
depicting a large eye with a crystal for its pupil
stares forth.
Wearing a mask of mastery causes the
wearer’s voice to sound more commanding
and authoritative, adding a +5 competence
bonus on Intimidate checks.
When activated, this mask allows you to
utter a command (as the spell; Will DC 20
negates). Unlike the command spell, this
effect is not language-dependent—the
target needs only to be able to hear you.
This ability functions once per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, command,
possession of a piece of the set.
Cost to Create: 1,750 gp, 140 XP, 4 days.
ARRAY OF THE
MANTICORE
This striking set of magic items grants you
the freedom of the skies and the power to
wreak havoc from above. Crafted in honor
of their namesake creature, the array of the
manticore is tailored for the individual who
fi ghts in the air or fi ghts airborne foes,
bestowing the ferocity of a manticore and
its fearsome sting.
Characters focused on making ranged
weapon attacks get the most benefi t from
the array of the manticore. Scouts and rangers
see the most benefi t, since an airborne
scout can skirmish more easily and a
ranger’s combat styles prove useful.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(arcana), or who have the bardic knowledge
ability, can research the array of the
manticore to learn more about these items.
When a character succeeds on a check, the
following lore is revealed, including the
information from lower DCs.
DC 15: A hobgoblin sorcerer crafted the
fi rst array of the manticore for his favorite
bugbear bodyguard. This bugbear rode a
tamed manticore into battle, and it seemed
fi tting to the hobgoblin to reward his
servant’s skill and bravery with a tribute
to his ferocity.
DC 20: A group of humans and halfi ngs
attacked the goblinoid stronghold. The
goblins were eventually defeated, but only
after many of the invaders died from the
javelins and spikes cast down upon them
from the air. The few survivors divided
up the array of the manticore among themselves,
not understanding the power the
items held when worn together. When

BEHIND THE CURTAIN:
MAGIC ITEM SETS
The concept of thematically linked sets of magic items that
provide more power when used together has a great pedigree
in fantasy fiction, but D&D has largely ignored this concept.
Magic Item Compendium presents item sets to remedy that.
The collection benefits of each set are carefully designed to
provide appealing bonus abilities that aren’t unbalancing. The
character never pays gold for these extra powers: Their value is
not added to the costs of the items in the set. We don’t want a
player whose item set components have not yet yielded any additional
abilities to feel like he has paid too much for his items.
If a character must somehow pay for the ability, collecting the
set feels more like working off a debt than seeking something
fun. Instead, the balancing factor of the sets comes from the PC
using his item slots for the items of the set instead of items that
might be more advantageous.
The value of a collection benefit stays within certain boundaries.
The collection benefit for two pieces should equal roughly
10% of the combined cost of the two cheapest items in the set.
Thereafter, collection benefits are valued at roughly 25% of the
cost of the cheapest item or combination of items you need to
reach the threshold of gaining the ability. The capstone ability
of the set might be as much as 30% of the value of the most
expensive item in the set.

companion, she discovered
the power of feather
fall granted by possessing two
pieces of the array. When this
knowledge spread among
the others, infighting
broke out, and
eventually only two
remained. They made a truce,
and each parted to investigate
the means of creating the missing
companion pieces. In this
way, use and knowledge of the
array spread.
DC 25: Although the array
of the manticore bears no curse
or magic that makes one
vulnerable, legend says
that the hobgoblin who
created the fi rst set also created
a spell whereby he could
command the movements of
the wearer by impelling the
items to move, accomplishing a jerky,
puppetlike control over a wearer’s body.
This spell also prevented the items from
being removed. Many have sought the
spell or attempted to recreate it, but no
one is known to have succeeded.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of the
set. Use this to drive further adventure

FIVE VIRTUES
Whether brave or meek, you will wake
to valor when girded with the five virtues,
legendary implements of courage
brandished by knights of a previous age.
When the five virtues are worn in part or
in whole, bold heroism blazes within
your chest.
These fi ve items were created to help
knights uphold their values. The abilities
granted by the set bolster various
abilities of that class (PH2 24), but the
items are also useful for warriors of other
disciplines.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(nobility and royalty), or who have the
bardic knowledge ability, can research the
five virtues to learn more about these items.
When a character succeeds on a check, the
following lore is revealed, including the
information from lower DCs.
DC 15: In an age now past, an order of
knights was chartered to defend against
illithid incursions. For hundreds of years,
the knights fought against all manner of
infi ltration, control, and even attempts at
invading small border kingdoms. Through
it all, the knights prevailed, relying on
their code to give them strength and
resolve. This code was a manifestation
of fi ve virtues upon which the order was
founded.
Those virtues came to be embodied
in a special set of magic items called,
appropriately enough, the five virtues. The
items exemplifi ed honor, freedom, valor,
vigilance, and sacrifi ce.
DC 20: The knightly order is long gone,
and even its name is lost to history. However,
archivists have studied relics found
in the ancient ruins of their stronghold.
Through knowledge gained thereby,
they learned about the lost virtues of the
knights. Archivists suspect, based on
clues unearthed in their delvings, that
some or all of the five virtues might yet be
found in far-separated keeps, or perhaps
in isolated treasures of long-lived subterranean
monsters.
DC 25: Recently, a group of miners
opened a new face on a coal seam they
had found long ago. Almost immediately
they broke into a cavity long sealed from
the surface. The cavity contained a warm,
salty lake in which eyeless, albino, manylegged
creatures swam. Unable to plumb
the lake’s depth, the miners did fi nd an
ancient ruin on the lake’s edge—some
sort of fortress, calcifi ed under years of
dripstone. In it they found some barely
preserved records of the knightly order.
The incomplete records claimed a dead
mind fl ayer community lay sealed beneath
the lake, and within that carcass of ancient
evil lay one or more pieces of the five virtues
stolen from the knights.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of
the set. Use this to drive further adventure
and direct the PCs toward some
location or story you would like them
to explore.

FLEET
WARRIOR’S
ARRAY
The fl eet warrior’s array is a work of art,
both in craftsmanship and magic. Apart,
the items prove a great boon, but together
they make their wearer as swift as the
wind and just as elusive. The items in this
set enable the elf warriors it was designed
for to move exceptionally quickly, as well
as to fi ght effectively under any conditions
and in all types of terrain. While wearing
this set, these warriors were almost impossible
to capture or even slow down.
The fl eet warrior’s array should appeal to
virtually any character, though spellcasters
get less benefi t from bracers of blinding
strike than adventurers who focus on
weapon attacks. Rogues and other stealthy
characters in particular should consider
the fl eet warrior’s array. Gaining an extra
sneak attack while fl anking can be critical,
and the benefi ts to mobility provided
by the array allow a rogue to focus less on
skills such as Tumble and Escape Artist,
and instead invest in other useful skills.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(arcana), or who have the bardic knowledge
ability, can research the fleet warrior’s
array to learn more about these items.
When a character succeeds on a check,
the following lore is revealed, including
the information from lower DCs.
DC 15: The fl eet warrior’s array was
created by an elf kingdom for a legion
of warriors chosen for their speed and
endurance. Called the Green Runners,
these warriors received special training
that built upon their talents. They were
noted for tirelessly running long distances
and for acting as expert scouts and commandos.
The Green Runners were the
kingdom’s elite fi ghting force, and bands
of Green Runners were occasionally sent
to aid the kingdom’s allies.
The warriors received pieces of the fleet
warrior’s array as an indication of rank. The
highest-ranking members owned all three
and were elevated out of the ranks of the
legion to serve as an elite cadre of Green
Runner guards for the royal family. Each
of the elves in this group effectively held
the rank of general and acted as an advisor
to the king and queen, a position to which
every Green Runner could aspire.
Tales of the Green Runners have traveled
widely, and in many of the lands
surrounding their former kingdom, elves
and half-elves tell tales of their bravery
and prowess. An elf or half-elf wearing an
item from the fl eet warrior’s array is often
mistaken for one of the Green Runners
by those who know the stories.
DC 20: When the elf kingdom was
conquered by its enemies, the Green
Runner generals went into hiding, taking
with them the pregnant queen and the
last hope of preserving the dynasty. They
vanished into the depths of a huge and
ancient forest, and efforts to locate their
hideout proved futile.
When the Green Runners fl ed into
the forest with the elf queen they split
into many small groups to confuse their
pursuers. The group that guarded the
queen never rejoined the rest, and now
the Green Runners who remain search
for clues to what happened to their leader
and her child. If the queen gave birth, the
royal heir would now be an adult, perhaps
ignorant of his or her heritage.
DC 25: Some say that the Green Runner
generals were traitors to the elf kingdom,
and they kidnapped the queen for some
personal gain. Those who tell these tales
blame the fall of the empire on the generals,
because the king lacked his best
fi ghters and advisors when the kingdom
was attacked and was forced to divide
his attention between two foes. That
the Green Runners now seek the queen
and her child there can be no doubt, but

Price (Item Level): 5,000 gp (9th)
Body Slot: Arms
Caster Level: 12th
Aura: Strong; (DC 21) transmutation
Activation: — and swift (command)
Weight: 1 lb.
This pair of elegant bracers is crafted from
green leather with mithral tracery that looks
like vines. Tiny, leaf-shaped plates of silver
branch off the mithral to create a glimmering
pattern.
These bracers grant you a +2 competence
bonus on initiative checks. This
is a continuous effect and requires no
activation.
When you activate bracers of blinding
strike, you can make one additional attack
with any weapon you are holding, as long
as you have already used the full attack
action during the turn. This attack is
made at your full base attack bonus, plus
any modifi ers appropriate to the situation.
This effect is not cumulative with
any other effect that grants you an extra
attack when making a full attack, such as
the Rapid Shot feat, a speed weapon, or
the haste spell.
This ability can be used three times
per day.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

tracks, as if affected by pass without trace.
When you activate these sandals, you
gain the benefi t of a water walk spell for
60 minutes. You can share this effect with
up to fi ve allies adjacent to you when you
activate the sandals, though doing this
reduces the overall duration accordingly.
For example, if you share the effect with
one other person, the duration is 30 minutes
apiece; if you share it with 5 other
people, the duration is 10 minutes apiece.
This ability functions once per day.

GARB OF THE
HUNTING CAT
Although made of mere steel and skin, the
garb of the hunting cat presents a powerful
combination of abilities that makes any
wearer a deadly predator. This garb gives
you the rending claws, incredible stealth,
and hunting ability of a tiger. While
anyone can wear the garb and become like
the beast, only the most skilled combatants
can use the abilities of the garb of the
hunting cat to their fullest.
Characters of any melee-oriented class
can fi nd the garb of the hunting cat useful,
but the set provides benefi ts most suited
to rangers, rogues, ninjas, and scouts.
Feats that help you capitalize on the set’s
abilities include Spring Attack and Two-

DC 15: The garb of the hunting cat fi rst
came to light due to a number of shocking
attacks upon human and elf settlements.
The countryside was terrorized by strange,
tigerlike people who would slaughter
whole villages. The creatures were diffi
cult to track and, when overmatched,
vanished into thin air. When at last one

was killed, the victors discovered not a
monster but a man wearing the garb of
the hunting cat.
DC 20: Those who attacked the
elves and humans were members
of a cult of rakshasa worshipers.
Each of the cultists was outfi tted
with a set of the garb of the
hunting cat, and participating
in a “hunt” against other
humanoids was a necessary
part of the rite of passage to
receive a set. Most of the sets
ended up in the hands of those
who survived cultist assaults
and were later sold.Many who
now wear parts of the garb of the
hunting cat are ignorant of the set’s
bloody history.
DC 25: The raksasha at the center
of the cult was confronted, but it
escaped and might still be alive. It’s
said that the evil creature can be
recognized in any form it adopts
because its natural form has pure
white fur without stripes, and it
seems incapable of creating hair
with any pigment when it adopts
another shape.
Many of those who have
collected the entire garb of the
hunting cat set have died by
the claws of some kind of
an animal. Stories abound
of hunting trips gone wrong,
supposedly domesticated beasts
going wild, and even of terrible
bloody deaths behind
locked doors that no animals
should be able to penetrate. The
common thread through all these
stories is that the death occurred when
the owner of the garb was not wearing it.
If the rakshasa is at fault, as many suspect,
its motives remain a mystery because the
pieces are always left behind with the body
of their owner.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of the
set. Use this to drive further adventure
and direct the PCs toward some location or

COLLECTION BENEFITS
The garb of the hunting cat provides you
with a deadly rending attack and the
power to disappear from sight. When
wearing the entire garb of the hunting cat,
you take on the appearance of a humanoid
tiger during combat. When this occurs,
the fur on the various items appears to
be that of a living creature, making you
appear something like a bestial rakshasa
or weretiger.
2 Pieces: If, during your turn, you hit
a single foe with both a primary claw
glove attack and an off-hand claw glove
attack, the second attack rends, dealing
an extra 3d6 points of damage. You
can rend only once per round.
3 Pieces: Once per day, you can
use invisibility on yourself (CL 3rd)
as a standard (mental) action.

GHARYN’S
MONASTIC
ARRAY
The half-moon shaped blade of the kama is
dangerous enough, but it becomes deadly
when infused with the power of ki. When
wielding this array of monastic tools, you
become as the wind: at times violent and
unstoppable, at other times a darting blur
of speed.
Gharyn’s monastic array is most useful for
a monk, especially one who uses a kama to
enhance her hand-to-hand fi ghting. Each
of the items allows its wielder to better
mimic the natural movements of a certain
animal, and some wielders believe that by
mimicking motions found in nature, they
will be able to merge their physical and
spiritual consciousnesses.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(arcana), or who have the bardic knowledge
ability, can research Gharyn’s monastic
array to learn more about these items.
When a character succeeds on a check,
the following lore is revealed, including
the information from lower DCs.
DC 15: The original monastic array was
discovered amid the ashes of a fallen monk
known as Gharyn. He died sacrifi cing his
life to protect his brother monks from the
wrath of a red dragon. Many believe that
the dragon’s fi re charged Gharyn’s array
with magical power.
DC 20: The Monastery of the Lone
Dove, a haven for ascetic monks devoted
to Pelor, had strict policies of asceticism,
silence, and discipline. Brothers ate two
bowls of rice per day, were allowed to
speak ten words outside of prayer, and had
to be in their chambers by sundown. Some
brothers chafed under this strict regimen.
One was a monk named Gharyn.
Gharyn didn’t believe such restrictions
applied to him. While he espoused
the support of l Mask of the tiger aw and order, he felt the
Mantle of the predator

monastery’s strictures were meaningless,
and he claimed they even hindered
the success of a lawful society. Needless
to say, this belief did not make him
particularly popular among his very
conservative and traditional brothers. He
knew that a change was needed, but that
it had to occur gradually for the brothers
to accept it.
Gharyn slowly altered his behavior
and routine. He substituted barley for
his bowl of rice and used long, multisyllabic
words for his ten per day. He was in
his room by sundown, but stayed up well
past midnight.
While many brothers objected to his
actions, Gharyn developed a cult following
in the monastery. He began to train
his supporters in unusual fi ghting styles
from around the world. He urged them to
reject meaningless strictures, but encouraged
people to follow the greater rules of
society. This was not a rejection of order
as much as an acknowledgment of the
universe’s true laws and mysteries.
The Monastery of the Lone Dove had
begun proceedings to expel Gharyn, but
fate stepped in when a fl ight of rampaging
dragons attacked. Many of the monks, so
used to their daily routines, were unable
to conduct a proper defense against a
siege by dragons. Gharyn took charge and
led the monks in battle, proving an able
leader. In the end, he sacrifi ced himself
by shielding the other monks from the
breath of a red dragon. His sacrifi ce gave
the others time to mount an offense that
repelled the dragons. In his ashes, three
items remained: a set of foot wrappings, a
mask, and a kama.
The items that remained among
Gharyn’s ashes became the uniform of the
Monastery of the Lone Dove. The monks
traveled far and wide, popularizing the
beliefs—and attire—of Gharyn.
DC 25: A monk named Nobara Lame
decries Gharyn’s memory, saying that
those who fondly remember the rebellious
monk are lying to themselves:
Strictures bring structure, structure
lends itself to law and an ascetic lifestyle.
Nobara’s anger over the rebellious spirit
popularized by Gharyn’s “lucky” sacrifi ce
has grown so extreme that his days are
now spent traveling between monasteries
to proclaim his views. Whenever he
comes upon someone wearing a piece of
Gharyn’s monastic array, whether original
or a copy, he calls that person out in a duel
to the death.

INSTRUMENTS
OF THE
BLOOD GIFT
The three instruments of the blood gift fuel
magic through personal sacrifi ce. When
precious blood is spilled, magical energy
is unleashed. With the proper instruments,
that energy can be harnessed,
directed, and used toward ends both
foul and fair.
The instruments of the blood gift are most
useful for sorcerers who want to further
enhance their sorcery—if they aren’t too
squeamish to sacrifi ce their own blood.
Characters of draconic origin can also
make use of the instruments’ power,
regardless of class.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge

ability, can research the instruments of the
blood gift to learn more about these items.
When a character succeeds on a check, the
following lore is revealed, including the
information from lower DCs.
DC 15: The instruments of the blood gift
were created by a sorcerer named Palamandius,
who used the principle behind their
manufacture to free himself and other
sorcerers from the tyranny of a mysterious
group called the Wizards of the Pure.
Instruments of the blood gift
DC 20: A cabal known as the Wizards
of the Pure sought to eliminate all
inborn magical talent in the world. The
cabal despised all those who came by
their magic from birth without study or
sacrifi ce—they equated such gifts with
devilish pacts and demonic corruption.
The Pure spoke of the dangers of uncontrolled
magical ability and “untrained
talent.”
In truth, the Wizards of the Pure did
more than seek—they sent out agents to
secretly round up a sampling of sorcerers
and other spontaneous spellcasters. Across
many lands, sorcerers of power large and
small went missing.
The captives found themselves bound
within the confi nes of a dead zone where
magic, both inborn and learned, was
suppressed. There they were housed,
without explanation and without hope
of release. The Wizards of the Pure hoped
that they could kill a creature’s talent
for sorcery if the fl ame was doused long
enough. All the kidnapped sorcerers
served the Pure as subjects in this hateful
experiment.
Fortunately for the captives, one among
them, a spellscale (see Races of the Dragon)
named Palamandius, possessed particular
talent. In his dreams, he could almost taste
again the magic that once ran in his blood.
In those dreams, he found salvation. Using
the power of his own blood to wake and
catalyze his suppressed sorcery—even
within the dead magic zone—he blasted
himself and his companions free. Unprepared
for the escape, the Pure saw its
power base destroyed.
With the insight gained while in captivity,
Palamandius crafted his item set,
which is powered through a sacrifi ce of
blood. As a result, he named them the
instruments of the blood gift.
DC 25: A scattering of surviving members
of the Wizards of the Pure still lurk
in large cities and villages. Now and then,
one or more of them, working alone or in
temporary alliance, decides to murder a
passing sorcerer out of fear and rage over
the splintering of their once-powerful
cabal.

While in a blood rage, a character
gains a +5 morale bonus on melee weapon

creature also takes 5 points of damage
each round at the end of its turn as its

DC 20: Alain’s spirit is said to be drawn
to pieces of the raiment. If all four pieces

secrets of the multiverse.
DC 25: The orc shaman Grotarb the Sly

briefl y. The orcs of Grotarb’s tribe heard
strange cries in the night from the
shaman’s private cavern. The next
day, the orcs of the tribe found the

body of their shaman, but
no pieces of the raiment. It’s said to

COLLECTION
BENEFITS
Wearing multiple pieces of the
raiment of the four grants you an
increasing number of protections
derived from aspects of the sky,
sun, sea, and earth.
When you wear all four
parts and use a belt of the wide
earth to teleport, it seems as
if a pillar of fi re strikes down
from the sky to engulf you (and
anyone else being transported).
When the fl ame dissipates, the
travelers are gone.
2 Pieces: You gain resistance
to cold 5; this stacks
with any similar resistances
you have from your race, class, or
template.
3 Pieces: You gain resistance to cold 5
and electricity 5, which stacks as described
above.
4 Pieces: You gain resistance to cold
5, electricity 5, and fi re 5, which stacks
as described above. Once per day, you
can ask four questions of the spirit of the
druid Alain, as the commune spell (CL 9th),
but using this ability negates the energy
resistances granted by the raiment until
the next sunrise.

RAIMENT
OF THE
STORMWALKER
To wear the raiment of the stormwalker is
to become the storm. With it, you can
travel on the thunderclouds and strike
at foes like lightning. Cloaked in clouds,
booming like thunder, and crackling with
electricity, you become a tempest.
The raiment of the stormwalker works
best in the hands of a monk, druid, or
other character who enters melee but
prefers not to wear armor. In particular,
a druid should consider the items of this
set, as its powers are available while in
wild shape. However, a character of any
class should consider collecting at least
two pieces of the set to gain some of the
raiment’s lesser collection benefi ts and the
abilities of the desired items.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(arcana) or Knowledge (nature), or who
have the bardic knowledge ability, can
research the raiment of the stormwalker
to learn more about these items. When
a character succeeds on a check, the following
lore is revealed, including the
information from lower DCs.
DC 15: The fi rst Stormwalker was a
half-orc druid. Unwelcome in the societies
of both parents, he learned to live in the
wilderness. The seasons were his teachers,
and the beasts his family. The half-orc
brought the rains to wash away his father’s
village and a lightning strike to consume
his mother’s home. Then he took the storm
as his symbol and came to be known as the
Stormwalker. He crafted the fi rst raiment
of the stormwalker for himself, and since
his death, the secrets of its creation and
the title of Stormwalker have been passed
on to others.
DC 20: The fi rst Stormwalker was killed
by his half-sister in revenge for his deadly
attack on their human mother’s home.
She was killed out of vengeance as well,
dying at the hands of the Stormwalker’s
orc father, who desired the power of his
son’s creations. The secrets of the raiment
thus passed into the possession of both
orcs and humans, and now druids of both
races claim the Stormwalker title, crafting
items with the same name.
DC 25: An inescapable vortex of vengeance
seems to follow those who wear
the whole raiment. No curse can be
detected on the items, but putting on the
whole raiment and becoming one of the
Stormwalkers always seems a harbinger
of trouble to come. Old enemies return
and the wearer soon fi nds that once-fast
friends become foes.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of the
set. Use this to drive further adventure
and direct the PCs toward some location or
story you would like them to explore.
COLLECTION BENEFITS
Wearing multiple pieces of the raiment
of the stormwalker gives you the power to
create clouds, call down electricity from
the sky, and laugh off lightning strikes.
When you wear the entire raiment of
the stormwalker, the robe of thunder fl ashes
with lightning that crackles across the
other parts of the raiment.
All the collection benefi ts of the raiment
function normally for and can be
activated by a druid while in wild shape,
even if the items have melded with her
form and would otherwise be considered
nonfunctional.
2 Pieces: You can use obscuring mist (CL
5th) as a standard (mental) action three
times per day.
3 Pieces: You can use call lightning (CL
5th) as a standard (mental action) once
per day.
4 Pieces: You take only half damage
from electricity. If such an attack allows
a save for half damage, you instead take no
damage on a successful save.

REGALIA OF
THE HERO
The three pieces of the regalia of the hero
are excellent tools for inspiring trust in
others. The trappings aid their wearer by
enabling him to aid others. Through mere
desire, the wearer can inspire trust and
greatness, and pull victory from seemingly
insurmountable odds.
The regalia of the hero is useful for a bard
or a marshal (MH 11), or anyone who wants
to motivate allies (or oneself) to greater
heights of ability and increase his chance
of success.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(arcana), or who have the bardic knowledge
ability, can research the regalia of
the hero to learn more about these items.
When a character succeeds on a check, the
following lore is revealed, including the
information from lower DCs.
DC 15: The three items of this set
belonged to a courageous soldier named
Reynard. He sacrifi ced his life to allow
his fellow soldiers to escape from an army
of orcs. Many believe that his sacrifi ce
empowered the regalia, allowing them to
inspire future generations.
DC 20: Bards fondly recall in song
and prose the Coalition of the Bulwark,
whose brave sacrifi ces enabled the defeat
of a great orc invasion. One of the great
heroes of the war was a young soldier
named Reynard Ellison.
Reynard served as an elite scout for the
army, but his best talents lay elsewhere.
His songs were electrifying, his words
calmed fears, and his very presence in
combat seemed to steady the hands of his
allies on their weapons.
During the war, Reynard conducted
a raid into the heart of the orcs’ offense.
The raid successfully discovered the orc’s
plans and codes, but before the raiders
could retreat, the creatures mounted a
fi erce counterattack. Reynard fought
in the rear guard as they retreated, his
encouraging shouts and skill with his
blade allowing his fellow soldiers to
escape. Reynard, however, failed to return
through the breach. While holding off
the enemy, he was slain by the throng
of orcs.
The pilfered plans and codes allowed
the Coalition of the Bulwark to fi nally
thwart the invasion. In the aftermath,
some of Reynard’s items were recovered,
including his helm, horn, and badge. The
intensity of Coalition members’ thankfulness
and remorse over Reynard’s loss
is said to have directly transfi gured the
items, creating the item set now called
the regalia of the hero.
DC 25: The Coalition of the Bulwark
persists yet, always vigilant to the possibility
of another great orc invasion
into civilized lands. The Coalition seeks
accomplished spies and adventurers to
supplement their own patrols. They occasionally
send such groups into orc-infested
wilderness to monitor the orcs and gauge
the probability of a new leader arising who
could pull their disparate tribes together.
Anyone applying at the Fortress of the
Bulwark could be assigned such a mission,
as well as given aid and assistance in the
fulfi llment of that mission.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of
the set. Use this to drive further adventure
and direct the PCs toward some
location or story you would like them
to explore.
COLLECTION BENEFITS
Wearing multiple parts of the regalia of the
hero awakens your ability to inspire and
command others. When you wear two
items, your eyes sparkle with the clarity
of conviction, and your posture straightens
with confi dence. When you sound a

two pieces, all three items fl ash with gold
light, like the promise of sunrise chasing

2 Pieces: You can grant a single ally
within 30 feet (other than yourself) a +5
insight bonus on a single attack, save, or
skill check as an immediate (command)
action. This ability functions once per

3 Pieces: You use a standard (command)

REGALIA OF
THE PHOENIX
Worn by royalty and borne by conquerors,
the regalia of the phoenix has no equal among
the magic crafted by humans or elves. Individually,
the pieces that make up the regalia
are magic items of stunning beauty and
reasonable power, but together they make
you a commanding fi gure of fl ames, lending
you the regal authority of the regalia’s
namesake and allowing you to stave off
death time and again.
The regalia of the phoenix can be used to
good effect by many characters, but sorcerers
and warlocks (CAr 5) fi nd it most
useful. Both kinds of characters rely on
Charisma and can wield the talon scepter,
a simple weapon. Remember that you
can use the rules in Chapter 6 to increase
the benefi t the items grant, so the +2 to
Charisma granted by a crown of fl ames
could become +4 or higher. If you are
a warlock or sorcerer who has a phoenix
cloak, consider replacing any invocation
or spell that grants you the ability to fl y;
you will benefi t more from the item and
the versatility of having access to a different
effect that you can bring to bear
on your foes.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(arcana), or who have the bardic knowledge
ability, can research the regalia of the
phoenix to learn more about these items.
When a character succeeds on a check,
the following lore is revealed, including

DC 15: The regalia of the phoenix sears
its story into the mind of every ambitious
noble who hears it. It made its fi rst
fi ery appearance in the possession of the
Phoenix Queen, a sorcerer of tremendous
power who took the throne of a longforgotten
kingdom by force. Because
the Phoenix Queen possessed all the
elements of the regalia, she could not be
defeated, and anyone who rose against
her was burnt to a cinder. After years
of her vicious rule, a lover tricked her
into removing her mask, pleading with
her to see her face. When she pulled the
mask away, revealing a face of cold beauty
untouched by remorse or sorrow, assassins
rose from the shadows, and she fell
beneath their many blades.
DC 20: After the assassins killed the
Phoenix Queen, they quarreled over the
regalia. Only four survived, each taking
a single piece. Fearing attempts by the
others to steal their pieces, they fl ed the

kingdom, spreading knowledge of the
regalia of the phoenix to foreign lands.
DC 25: The forgotten kingdom of
legend was an elf empire, and some say
that the Phoenix Queen’s lover also survived
the assassin’s quarrel. According
to some, the lover was true to his pitiless
mistress, and the assassins tricked him
into asking the queen to remove her
mask. Rumors persist that this elf lives
still, clutching to life despite his extreme
age and the call of his ancestors, hanging
on with the inhuman strength that only
a thirst for vengeance can give. It’s said he
seeks any who would dare profi t from the
assassins’ foul deed by using any piece of
the regalia or its copies. When he fi nds
them, he snuffs out their lives as calmly
as one might blow out a candle.

and direct the PCs toward some location or

COLLECTION BENEFITS
Wearing parts of the regalia of the phoenix

legendary phoenixes enjoy. When a creature

phoenix and wields the talon scepter, all the
items appear to transform into pure fi re,

fi ery wings. Should the user of the whole
regalia fall in battle, her body seems to be

SEVEN VEILS
Bright and diaphanous, the seven veils are
magic made physical. Split from light by
a god and sown onto the world like seeds,
the veils represent the promise of power
for wizards and other spellcasters.
Wizards get the most benefi t from the
seven veils. Although any arcane spellcaster
might benefi t from some or all
of the veils—and would appreciate the
versatility granted by wearing the entire
set together—a wizard typically has the
greater variety of spells
necessary to put the veils
to best use.
Each of the seven veils
corresponds to one of the
colors that signify the various
effects of a prismatic
spell, such as prismatic eye
(SC 161), prismatic mist (PH2
121), prismatic ray (SC 162),
prismatic spray, and prismatic
wall.

CHAPTER 5
MAGIC ITEM
SETS
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge
(arcana), or who have the bardic knowledge
ability, can research the seven veils
to learn more about these items. When
a character succeeds on a check, the following
lore is revealed, including the
information from lower DCs.
DC 15: It’s said the fi rst seven veils
were drawn from a rainbow by Boccob
himself. The Lord of All Magics then let
the veils fall to the earth, each fl uttering
down to a particular wizard. The seven
veils correspond to the seven colors of
the rainbow and the seven colors created
by spells such as prismatic wall. Each veil
grants an ability modeled after the effect
of a color of a prismatic spell. Each veil
also guards its wearer from that color’s
effect if she is the subject of a prismatic
spell.
DC 20: Three of the wizards who
received one of the seven veils decided
to craft their own sets, but four of them
chose instead to try to claim the six veils
Boccob gave the others. A series of battles
ensued, and in the end two wizards possessed
complete sets while the rest lay
dead. The extra pieces that had been created
were left unclaimed, and so they fell
into the hands of others.
DC 25: The two wizards who managed
to claim full sets both became liches. This
turn of events is considered a coincidence
by most, but some wonder if wearing all
seven veils might somehow induce this
state. Those who concern themselves with
such things wonder if Boccob truly created
them, or if perhaps Wee Jas crafted
them for some purpose of her own. Both
deities remain silent on the matter, and
no one else is known to have worn a
full set.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of
the set. Use this to drive further adventure
and direct the PCs toward some
location or story you would like them
to explore.

VESTMENTS OF
DIVINITY
The vestments of divinity are a set of hallowed
items that allow you to deny sin,
wage war against evil, and put an end to
malevolence wherever it is found.
The vestments of divinity are most
useful if you are a good-aligned cleric or
a paladin, since they enhance your divine
abilities to combat evil and destroy
undead. However, any character can
appreciate the benefi ts of at least
some of the items in this set.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in
Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge
(religion), or who have

divinity to learn more about

succeeds on a check,
the following lore is revealed,
including the information
from lower DCs.
DC 15: The vestments of divinity
were revealed to a holy man named
Reesh N’Faeren in a vision. He spent years
tracking down each sacred relic until he
gathered them all.

CHAPTER 5
MAGIC ITEM
SETS
DC 20: When Reesh N’Faeren was a
child, his village was terrorized by fl ailwielding
cultists calling themselves the
Heralds of Hell. The cult was eventually
driven off, but not before Reesh’s family
was taken from him. Reesh was spared, but
he grew into an adult with an unfl inching
hatred of all those unaligned with his own
sense of righteousness. His purity of purpose
was given expression in the temple
where he began training as a cleric. One
night, while still an acolyte, Reesh received
a vision, imparting to him vague knowledge
concerning the location of fi ve sacred
relics. He was given to understand that if he
gathered all the items together, he could use
them to destroy the Heralds of Hell.
Reesh spent years adventuring, following
treasure maps, tracking leads,
and following up clues, until he fi nally
located all the items his vision had shown
him years before. With these vestments,
Reesh set out to fulfi ll the penultimate
quest of his life. Whether he succeeded
or ultimately failed, history does not
record.
DC 25: A group of destruction worshipers
called the Heralds of Hell has
cells in several large cities. The Heralds
utilize both devils and undead in their
destructive rites. Some time back, several
of their cells were eradicated by a
holy vigilante. It’s unclear whether this
vigilante was Reesh N’Faeren himself,
or someone to whom Reesh passed along
his vestments. Ultimately, a few cells
escaped destruction, and the vigilante
disappeared. It is whispered that he was
killed in a confl ict with the cult, and that
the cells of the Heralds that remained
each took one of the vestments, hoping
to ensure that no one could gather them
all together again.
DC 30: A check result of 30 or higher
reveals the location of another piece of the
set. Use this to drive further adventure
and direct the PCs toward some location or
story you would like them to explore.
COLLECTION BENEFITS
Wearing the vestments of divinity grants you
powers that bolster your ability to battle
evil creatures, from a stronger resolve
against their attacks to a stronger resistance

WRAITH’S WOE
The items that make up the wraith’s woe
live up to the name, making you a deadly
enemy both to spirits and the walking
dead. However, although they were constructed
to battle undead, the items in the
set are useful in encounters with a variety
of creatures, both living and unliving.
Wizards, sorcerers, and other spellcasters
who have poor Fortitude saves
likely benefi t from this set the most,
since they are in more danger from the
necromantic powers typically possessed
by undead. Also, level drain reduces a
spellcaster’s effectiveness dramatically,
whereas a fi ghter or other character
focused on physical attacks can likely still
get by even with the penalties of negative
levels. Finally, gauntlets of ghost fi ghting
offer a rare opportunity for spellcasters
to affect incorporeal foes normally. A set
of the wraith’s woe makes a good investment
for any character preparing to face
undead. The relatively low prices of the
items make purchasing particular pieces
an option even for a low-level party. You
might consider having a few characters
purchase the different pieces of wraith’s
woe and then having the PC who suffers
the most from the attacks of undead put
on all the items to restore ability damage
and drain.
LORE
Characters who have ranks in Knowledge

have the bardic knowledge ability, can
research the wraith’s woe to learn more
about these items. When a character succeeds
on a check, the following lore is
revealed, including the information from
lower DCs.
DC 15: The fi rst example of this set was
created over a century ago by a human
mystic theurge who devoted herself to
hunting undead after her family was slain
by wraiths. This mystic theurge founded a
holy order devoted to battling undead and
created sets of the wraith’s woe for those
who joined her quest. Members of this
order had to earn items from these sets
by slaying a suffi cient number of undead
while also adhering to the order’s ideals
of bravery, self-sacrifi ce, and compassion
for innocent mortals.
DC 20: The order, known as the Blades
Against Death, still exists. Composed
mainly of paladins and clerics, the order
sponsors adventurers of every stripe in
quests against undead. Adventurers who
perform well are often offered membership
in the organization and granted

order’s founder rewarded the original
members. Being a member has other
benefi ts, since Blades Against Death
has decades of experience confronting
undead, and its members have learned
much during that time that can aid those
who share their cause.
DC 25: High-ranking members of the
Blades Against Death have been heard to
speak of the order’s founder as though
she still lives and speaks to them. If it’s
true, she must be undead herself, for no
human could live so long. Those who
openly suggest this possibility are labeled
blasphemers by the Blades Against Death
and exiled from the order. Such individuals
are then never seen again, leading some
to think that the Blades Against Death is
capturing or killing these ex-members.
Of course, to suggest such or question
the order about how it handles blasphemers
causes a member to be labeled a
