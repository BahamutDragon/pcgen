Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Warlock ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																	DESC:Warlocks are proficient with all simple weapons. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for warlock invocations are relatively simple, a warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like arcane spellcasters, a warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (all invocations, including eldritch blast, have a somatic component). A multiclass warlock still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from levels in other classes.

Invocations				KEY:Warlock ~ Invocations				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DEFINE:WarlockInvocationLVL|0																								DESC:A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will, with the following qualifications: A warlock's invocations are spell-like abilities; using an invocation is therefore a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. An invocation can be disrupted, just as a spell can be ruined during casting. A warlock is entitled to a Concentration check to successfully use an invocation if he is hit by an attack while invoking, just as a spellcaster would be. A warlock can choose to use an invocation defensively, by making a successful Concentration check, to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity. A warlock's invocations are subject to spell resistance unless an invocation's description specifically states otherwise. A warlock's caster level with his invocations is equal to his warlock level. The save DC for an invocation (if it allows a save) is 10 + equivalent spell level + the warlock's Charisma modifier. Since spell-like abilities are not actually spells, a warlock cannot benefit from the Spell Focus feat. He can, however, benefit from the Ability Focus feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual), as well as from feats that emulate metamagic effects for spell-like abilities, such as Quicken Spell-Like Ability and Empower Spell-Like Ability (see pages 303 and 304 of the Monster Manual). The four grades of invocations, in order of their relative power, are least, lesser, greater, and dark. A warlock begins with knowledge of one invocation, which must be of the lowest grade (least). As a warlock gains levels, he learns new invocations, as summarized on Table 1-1 and described below. A list of available invocations can be found following this class description, and a complete description of each invocation can be found in Chapter 4 of this book. At any level when a warlock learns a new invocation, he can also replace an invocation he already knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade. At 6th level, a warlock can replace a least invocation he knows with a different least invocation (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be either least or lesser). At 11th level, a warlock can replace a least or lesser invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, or greater). At 16th level, a warlock can replace a least, lesser, or greater invocation he knows with another invocation of the same or a lower grade (in addition to learning a new invocation, which could be least, lesser, greater, or dark). Finally, unlike other spell-like abilities, invocations are subject to arcane spell failure chance as described under Weapon and Armor Proficiency above. Warlocks can qualify for some prestige classes usually intended for spellcasters; see Warlocks and Prestige Classes, page 18, for details.

Eldritch Blast			KEY:Warlock ~ Eldritch Blast				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DEFINE:WarlockEldritchBlastLVL|0																							DESC:The first ability a warlock learns is eldritch blast. A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. An eldritch blast is a ray with a range of 60 feet. It is a ranged touch attack that affects a single target, allowing no saving throw. An eldritch blast deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. An eldritch blast is the equivalent of a spell whose level is equal to one-half the warlock's class level (round down), with a minimum spell level of 1st and a maximum of 9th when a warlock reaches 18th level or higher. An eldritch blast is subject to spell resistance, although the Spell Penetration feat and other effects that improve caster level checks to overcome spell resistance also apply to eldritch blast. An eldritch blast deals half damage to objects. Metamagic feats cannot improve a warlock's eldritch blast (because it is a spell-like ability, not a spell). However, the feat Ability Focus (eldritch blast) increases the DC for all saving throws (if any) associated with a warlock's eldritch blast by 2. See page 303 of the Monster Manual.

SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Fiendish Resilience		KEY:Warlock ~ Fiendish Resilience			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality																															DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a warlock knows the trick of fiendish resilience. Once per day, as a free action, he can enter a state that lasts for 2 minutes. While in this state, the warlock gains fast healing 1. At 13th level, a warlock's fiendish resilience improves. When in his fiendish resilience state, he gains fast healing 2 instead. At 18th level, a warlock's fiendish resilience improves to fast healing 5.

Imbue Item				KEY:Warlock ~ Imbue Item				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality																															DESC:A warlock of 12th level or higher can use his supernatural power to create magic items, even if he does not know the spells required to make an item (although he must know the appropriate item creation feat). He can substitute a Use Magic Device check (DC 15 + spell level for arcane spells or 25 + spell level for divine spells) in place of a required spell he doesn't know or can't cast. If the check succeeds, the warlock can create the item as if he had cast the required spell. If it fails, he cannot complete the item. He does not expend the XP or gp costs for making the item; his progress is simply arrested. He cannot retry this Use Magic Device check for that spell until he gains a new level.

Spells				KEY:Warmage ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Warmage Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																	DESC:A warmage casts arcane spells (the same type of spells available to sorcerers and wizards), which are drawn from the warmage spell list given below. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time the way a cleric or wizard must. When a warmage gains access to a new level of spells, he automatically knows all the spells for that level listed on the warmage's spell list. Essentially, his spell list is the same as his spells known list. Warmages also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below). See page 90 for the warmage's spell list. To cast a spell, a warmage must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell's level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1stlevel spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a warmage's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the warmage's Charisma modifier. Like other spellcasters, a warmage can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-1: The Warmage. In addition, he receives bonus spells for a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). Unlike a cleric or a wizard, a warmage need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level.

Armored Mage			KEY:Warmage ~ Armored Mage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Warmage Class Feature.SpecialQuality																															DESC:Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster's gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components). A warmage's limited focus and specialized training, however, allows him to avoid arcane spell failure as long as he sticks to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to medium or heavier armors, nor to heavy shields. Nor does this ability apply to spells gained from a different spellcasting class. At 8th level, a warmage learns to use medium armor with no chance of arcane spell failure.

Warmage Edge			KEY:Warmage ~ Warmage Edge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Warmage Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:WarmageEdgeBonusDamage|0																									DESC:A warmage is specialized in dealing damage with his spells. Whenever a warmage casts a spell that deals hit point damage, he adds his Intelligence bonus (if any) to the amount of damage dealt. For instance, if a 1st-level warmage with 17 Intelligence casts magic missile, he deals 1d4+1 points of damage normally, plus an extra 3 points of damage due to his Intelligence bonus. The bonus from the warmage edge special ability applies only to spells that he casts as a warmage, not to those he might have by virtue of levels in another class. A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a fireball deals the extra damage to all creatures in the area it affects. However, if a 3rd-level warmage casts magic missile and produces two missiles, only one of them (of the warmage's choice) gains the extra damage, even if both missiles are directed at the same target. If a spell deals damage for more than 1 round, it deals this extra damage in each round. Scrolls scribed by a warmage do not gain any benefit from warmage edge. Scrolls activated by a warmage also gain no benefit from warmage edge. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However, staffs activated by a warmage use not only the warmage's caster level but also gain the benefits of the warmage edge, if applicable.

She is limited to a certain number of spells of each spell level per day, according to her class level. A wu jen must choose and prepare spells ahead of time like a wizard (see Preparing Wizard Spells, page 177 of the Player's Handbook). To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a wu jen must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level. A wu jen's bonus spells are based on Intelligence. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against wu jen spells is 10 + the spell's level + the wu jen's Intelligence modifier. A wu jen's base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-3.

The spell's level does not change, and once the choice of spell and modification are chosen, they cannot be changed. As the wu jen goes up in level, she can choose the same spell to be modified in different ways with multiple spell secrets. She does not need to know the feat she applies to the spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.15
Elemental Mastery			KEY:Wu Jen ~ Elemental Mastery			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wu Jen Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																	DESC:Many of the wu jen's spells are divided into five elemental groups: earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. At 6th level, instead of receiving a spell secret, a wu jen becomes a master of one of these five elements (her choice). Thereafter, whenever a wu jen casts a spell of that element, her effective caster level (for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks) is increased by two. In addition, the wu jen herself gets a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against spells of that element. Certain spells on the wu jen spell list are designated "All"; this means they belong to all elemental groups, and a wu jen who is a master of any element gains the mastery bonuses with respect to those spells.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.16
Spellbooks				KEY:Wu Jen ~ Spellbooks					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wu Jen Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																	DESC:A wu jen must study her spellbooks each day to prepare her spells, much like a wizard. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook (except for read magic, which all wu jen can prepare from memory). A wu jen begins play with a spellbook containing all 0- level wu jen spells plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wu jen has (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook), the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wu jen level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wu jen level). For example, when Hide-yori achieves 5th level, she can cast 3rd-level spells. At this point, she can add two 3rd-level spells to her spellbook, or one 2nd-level spell and one 3rd-level spell, or any combination of two spells between 1st and 3rd level. At any time, a wu jen can also add spells found in other wu jen's spellbooks to her own, much like a wizard (see Adding Spells to a Wizard's Spellbook, page 178 of the Player's Handbook).

If a wu jen violates one of her taboos, she cannot cast any more spells that day. A wu jen must choose one taboo at 1st level, and one additional taboo every time she learns a spell secret. Possible taboos include: . Cannot eat meat. . Cannot own more than she can carry. . Must make a daily offering (such as food, flowers, or incense) to one or many spirit powers. . Cannot bathe. . Cannot cut her hair. . Cannot touch a dead body. . Cannot drink alcohol. . Cannot wear a certain color. . Cannot light a fire. .

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, a bonus feat, and so on). If she had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an alienist, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Familiar Abilities			KEY:Alienist ~ Familiar Abilities						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Alienist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Levels of alienist stack with levels of any class that provide access to a familiar. Add levels from this class and the class that granted access to the familiar together and refer to the table on page 53 of the Player's Handbook to determine the familiar's natural armor, Intelligence, and special abilities. If a character had levels in multiple classes that grant access to a familiar before becoming an alienist, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining the abilities of her familiar. This ability does not grant an alienist a familiar if she does not already have one.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Summon Alien				KEY:Alienist ~ Summon Alien							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Alienist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Whenever an alienist would use any summon monster spell to summon a celestial or fiendish creature, she instead summons a pseudonatural version of that creature. For example, by casting summon monster IV, she could summon a pseudonatural dire wolf. This adds the pseudonatural template (see page 160) to the summoned creature. An alienist gives up the ability to summon nonpseudonatural creatures with a summon monster spell. For instance, the alienist described above couldn't summon a mephit or howler with summon monster IV.

SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Mad Certainty				KEY:Alienist ~ Mad Certainty							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Alienist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 4th level, an alienist's mad certainty in the power of entities beyond the reach of normal space and time lend her an unnatural fortitude, granting her an additional 3 hit points. However, constantly dwelling on such beings is mentally corrosive, and the alienist's mind begins to fracture. She now takes a -4 penalty on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Handle Animal checks made to influence nonpseudonatural creatures.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Pseudonatural Familiar			KEY:Alienist ~ Pseudonatural Familiar					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Alienist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:Beginning at 5th level, an alienist's familiar, if any, gains the pseudonatural template (see page 160) in addition to the powers and abilities normal for a familiar of the appropriate level. This effect does not replace an existing familiar-the familiar has been slowly taking on pseudonatural aspects as the alienist rises in level, and those characteristics become fully functional at this point. From now on, the alienist's newly summoned familiars already possess the pseudonatural template. If an alienist has no familiar, this ability has no effect.

Extra Summoning				KEY:Alienist ~ Extra Summoning						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Alienist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:From 6th level on, an alienist gains one extra spell slot at her highest spell level.

Her penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Handle Animal checks made to influence nonpseudonatural creatures increases to -10.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Timeless Body				KEY:Alienist ~ Timeless Body							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Alienist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 9th level, an alienist learns the secret of perpetual youth. She no longer takes ability penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged (see Table 6-5, page 109 of the Player's Handbook). Ability score bonuses from aging still accrue, and any penalties the alienist might have already taken remain in place. An alienist is stolen away by horrible entities when her time is up, and she is never seen again.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Alien Transcendence			KEY:Alienist ~ Alien Transcendence						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Alienist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A 10th-level alienist, because of long association with alien entities and intense study of insane secrets, transcends her mortal form and becomes an alien creature. Her type changes to outsider. Additionally, she gains damage reduction 10/magic and resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10. Upon achieving alien transcendence, an alienist undergoes a minor physical change, usually growing a small tentacle or other strange feature, such as an extra appendage, organ, eye, or enigmatic lump. An alienist can hide this abnormality in a robe or hood, but the alien growth is not under the alienist's control and sometimes moves, twitches, opens, or otherwise animates of its own accord. This applies a -4 penalty on Disguise checks an alienist makes to conceal her true nature. Anyone who shares an alienist's predilection for study of the Far Realms immediately recognizes her transcendent nature, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma- based skill checks and ability checks when interacting with such beings. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks involving any other creatures to whom she reveals her abnormal nature.

Spells per Day/Spells Known		KEY:Argent Savant ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Argent Savant Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:At each level after 1st, an argent savant gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If she had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an argent savant, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Force Specialization			KEY:Argent Savant ~ Force Specialization					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Argent Savant Class Feature.SpecialQuality																	DESC:An argent savant gains a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls made with her force spells. She also adds a +1 bonus to each die of damage dealt by spells she casts with the force descriptor. If the force spell doesn't deal damage expressed by dice, she adds only a +1 bonus to the total damage dealt. For example, a magic missile cast by a 9th-level wizard/1stlevel argent savant deals 1d4+2 points of damage per missile. A 9th-level wizard/4th-level argent savant deals 4d6+7 points of force damage with her Mordenkainen's sword spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Force Armor					KEY:Argent Savant ~ Force Armor						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Argent Savant Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 2nd level and higher, an argent savant gains more benefit from defensive force spells than other characters. If she casts a force spell that provides an armor bonus or a shield bonus to Armor Class, she increases the spell's normal armor bonus by 2. For example, mage armor normally adds an armor bonus of +4 to the caster's AC, but an argent savant with this ability who casts mage armor adds an armor bonus of +6 to her AC.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Enduring Force				KEY:Argent Savant ~ Enduring Force						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Argent Savant Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:Force spells cast by an argent savant of 3rd level or higher linger longer than normal, and they are more difficult to counter or dispel. The duration of a force spell cast by the savant is doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to it. However, the spell's level and casting time are unchanged. The same restrictions that apply to extended spells apply to spells affected by enduring force. In addition, the DC required to counter or dispel the argent savant's force spells increases by 4.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Ablate Force				KEY:Argent Savant ~ Ablate Force						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Argent Savant Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:Due to her improved understanding of magical force, an argent savant of 4th level or higher can prevent force damage to herself. She subtracts her class level from damage dealt by any force spell or effect. A force spell producing multiple attacks, such as magic missile, is considered a single attack for this purpose; deduct the savant's level from the total damage dealt by the spell, not the damage dealt by each individual missile.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.25
Unbind Force				KEY:Argent Savant ~ Unbind Force						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Argent Savant Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 5th level, an argent savant learns how to unweave a force spell or effect and liberate its magical energy. As a standard action, she can attempt to dispel a single force spell or effect within 60 feet (even those normally immune to dispel magic, such as wall of force). If she succeeds on a caster level check (DC 11 + opposing caster's level), the force effect is unbound. This immediately dispels the effect and deals 1d6 points of force damage per level of the dispelled spell to all creatures and objects within 10 feet of the unbound spell. For example, if an argent savant unbound another caster's wall of force, the liberated spell energy would deal 5d6 points of force damage to anyone within 10 feet of the wall's former location.

# Blood Magus

SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Spells per Day/Spells Known		KEY:Blood Magus ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality																		DESC:At each level except 5th and 10th, a blood magus gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a blood magus, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Blood Component				KEY:Blood Magus ~ Blood Component						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:A blood magus can substitute a drop of his own blood for a spell's material components, if any, and in so doing increase the spell's power. The pinprick or minor knife cut to draw the requisite blood is a free action (just like using material components) that becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Using this ability deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus but raises the spell's caster level by 1. Damage reduction, if the character has any, doesn't apply to this damage. If a spell has a costly material component (greater than 1 gp), the component must still be provided. If a spell has no material component, a blood magus can still use this ability to enhance a spell if he desires.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.26
Durable Casting				KEY:Blood Magus ~ Durable Casting						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:A blood magus has a knack for being able to concentrate on casting spells and maintaining them despite taking damage while doing so. For the purpose of making a Concentration check to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when he might be distracted by damage, a blood magus subtracts his level from any hit point damage dealt to him by an attack that strikes him during the action (or whenever he is subject to a source of continuous damage, such as Melf's acid arrow). A blood magus still takes all the damage dealt to him, but the damage is less likely to affect his ability to cast, concentrate on, or direct spells successfully. For example, a 1st-level blood magus can "ignore" 1 point of damage from each source that damages him while casting a spell for the purpose of determining the DC of his Concentration check to cast successfully. If struck for 5 points of damage while casting a spell, he must make a Concentration check to successfully cast, but the DC is only 10 + 4 (damage dealt minus 1) + the spell's level. A 5th-level blood magus could ignore up to 5 points of damage dealt from each source that damages him during casting (and thus wouldn't have to make a Concentration check if struck for 5 points of damage or less). Because of this ability, damage a blood magus takes from using his blood component and bloodseeking spell special abilities never requires him to make a Concentration check to finish the spell he is casting.																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Stanch					KEY:Blood Magus ~ Stanch							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:A blood magus automatically becomes stable when his hit points drop below 0.

SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Scarification				KEY:Blood Magus ~ Scarification						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a blood magus can inscribe spells on his own skin for later use. This process involves deeply scratching the skin (which deals no damage but often leaves scars). The scratches remain fresh until the inscribed spell is cast, at which time the wound heals normally. Effectively, a blood magus gains the Scribe Scroll feat (see page 99 of the Player's Handbook) using an alternative medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Scribe Scroll also apply to this ability. Likewise, "reading" a scar follows the same rules as reading a scroll, but only a blood magus can decipher his own scars. One's own skin leaves a limited amount of room to easily inscribe and "read" magical scars. Thus, a blood magus can have only six of these scars at any one time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Death Knell					KEY:Blood Magus ~ Death Knell							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 3rd level and higher, a blood magus has the ability to use death knell as the spell once per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Blood Draught				KEY:Blood Magus ~ Blood Draught						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 4th level, a blood magus learns how to store spells of up to 3rd level in his own blood. Effectively, he gains the Brew Potion feat (see page 89 of the Player's Handbook) using an alternative medium. All rules, XP costs, and expenses that apply to Brew Potion also apply to this ability, with the following exceptions. Once "brewed," a blood draught remains in circulation within a magus's body. The maximum number of draughts he can store at one time is equal to his blood magus level + his Con score, but if he is ever slain, they are all immediately ruined-even if he is subsequently returned to life. Blood draughts are never accidentally lost through major blood loss or by a blood-draining attack. To consume a draught, a blood magus pricks his skin, automatically bringing forth the desired effect. This is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, like drinking a potion. Another individual can partake of a blood draught (if he or she has a strong stomach) by drinking 1 ounce of the blood magus's blood as a full-round action. The blood magus must have an open wound to share the effects of a blood draught with another creature; if he lacks one, the creature can inflict a wound that deals 1 point of damage to the blood magus as part of the action to consume the draught. A blood magus cannot store his blood in a container to share at a later time. The blood draught must be drawn fresh from his body, or it loses potency within 1 round.																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Homunculus					KEY:Blood Magus ~ Homunculus							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:From 5th level on, a blood magus can use his blood to give life to a new companion creature-a homunculus (see page 154 of the Monster Manual). A blood magus need not meet any of the given prerequisites to create the homunculus; however, a blood magus must permanently sacrifice 1 hit point as part of the creation process. The process requires 1 hour. A blood magus enjoys a stronger than normal link with his homunculus. By touching the homunculus, a blood magus can transfer his wounds to the creature (up to 1 hp per level with each touch). This is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Each time a blood magus gains a class level, his homunculus advances 1 Hit Die, as described on page 290 of the Monster Manual, and it gains all the normal benefits of its increased Hit Dice (increased base attack bonus, saves, and so on). The homunculus advances to a maximum of 6 Hit Dice when the blood magus reaches 9th level. If his homunculus is destroyed, a blood magus takes 2d10 points of damage, as noted in the Monster Manual. A blood magus's death results in the death of his homunculus. A blood magus can have only one homunculus at any given time.																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.27
Bloodseeking Spell			KEY:Blood Magus ~ Bloodseeking Spell					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:Beginning at 6th level, a blood magus can imbue his spells with the ability to draw blood from their targets. To use this ability, a blood magus must inflict a wound on himself; this is a free action that deals 3 points of damage to the blood magus and becomes a normal part of casting the spell. Damage reduction, if a blood magus has any, doesn't apply to this damage. A bloodseeking spell deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to each target that takes damage from the spell. This extra damage applies only to spells that deal hit point damage, not to spells that deal ability damage, ability drain, or other kinds of damage. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Thicker Than Water			KEY:Blood Magus ~ Thicker Than Water					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 7th level and higher, a blood magus's vital fluids are partially under his control. When a blood magus is injured, his blood withdraws from the wound, avoiding some damage that he would otherwise take. This ability gives the blood magus damage reduction 1/bludgeoning.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Awaken Blood				KEY:Blood Magus ~ Awaken Blood						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 8th level and higher, a blood magus can bestow momentary consciousness on an opponent's blood. If he hits a foe with a melee touch attack, the opponent's blood tries to get free of its confinement-all at once. The pressure disrupts the victim's tissues, dealing 10d10 points of damage. This ability is usable only once per day, but a blood magus can try to use it again later in the day if his previous attempt failed. The effect is instantaneous. Constructs, elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and any creatures without blood or a similar substance within their bodies are immune to this effect.

SOURCEPAGE:p.28
Bloodwalk					KEY:Blood Magus ~ Bloodwalk							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Blood Magus Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 10th level, a blood magus becomes perfectly attuned to the song of blood. He gains the supernatural ability to transport himself great distances via the blood of living creatures. Once per day as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can seamlessly enter any living creature (except an elemental, ooze, plant, undead, or other creature without blood or a similar fluid) whose size equals or exceeds his own and pass any distance to another living creature on the same plane in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. A blood magus merely designates a direction and distance ("a living creature twenty miles due west of here"), and the bloodwalk ability transports him to a destination creature as close as possible to the desired location. He can't specify a named individual as the endpoint unless he has previously obtained a sample of that creature's blood and has it preserved in a vial that he carries. The entry and destination creatures need not be familiar to the blood magus. A blood magus cannot use himself as an entry creature. If an intended entry creature is unwilling, he must make a successful melee touch attack to enter. (A missed touch attack does not use up the ability for that day.) When exiting a creature, a blood magus chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and exiting a creature is painless unless a blood magus wishes otherwise (see below). In most cases, though, the destination creature finds being the endpoint of a magical portal surprising and quite unsettling. If he desires, a blood magus can attempt to make a bloody exit from the destination creature. He bursts forth explosively from the creature's body, dealing 10d6 points of damage unless the creature makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + blood magus's class level + blood magus's Con modifier). When he makes a bloody exit, a blood magus must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round from the shock of his expulsion.

Craft Effigy				KEY:Effigy Master ~ Craft Effigy						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Effigy Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:An effigy master can create constructs known as effigies (see page 151). Unlike other creators, he need not possess the Craft Construct feat to complete this task, nor does he need the feat or ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering) to repair an effigy he creates (see page 151 for details on repairing an effigy). An effigy master can add his class level to his caster level to determine the maximum Hit Dice of effigy that he can create. Crafting an effigy requires a body to be built from wood, leather, metal, and wire. This requires a DC 15 Craft (woodworking, leatherworking, or metalworking) check. The gp and XP required to create the effigy depends on its size, as described on page 155.

Effigy Link					KEY:Effigy Master ~ Effigy Link						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Effigy Master Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:At 5th level and higher, an effigy master can create a supernatural bond between himself and one of his effigies. This requires a 1-hour ritual. Afterward, the effigy master can sense the effigy's condition (as if he had cast status on the effigy), and can scry on the effigy (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day. Furthermore, an effigy master gains a +1 morale bonus on saving throws and caster level checks as long as he is within 5 feet of his bonded effigy. An effigy master can be linked to only one effigy at any time. If the linked effigy is destroyed, or if the effigy master wants to establish a new link, he can create a link to another effigy (and eliminate the old link) by performing the ritual with the new effigy.

Elemental Specialty			KEY:Elemental Savant ~ Elemental Specialty				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Elemental Savant Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:The first step toward transcending mortal form requires an elemental savant to choose her elemental specialty. Upon entering the class, she must select an element and its associated energy type (air = electricity, earth = acid, fire = fire, or water = cold). This choice must match the Energy Substitution feat that the savant selected to gain entry to the prestige class. When the savant casts a spell that normally deals energy damage, its energy descriptor changes to the savant's chosen energy type, and it deals damage of that energy type instead of its normal energy type. For example, an elemental savant choosing to specialize in fire could still cast meld into stone, and its descriptor would not change because it does not deal energy damage. However, if she casts Melf's acid arrow, the spell would deal fire damage and have the fire descriptor instead of dealing acid damage and having the acid descriptor.

Her type changes to elemental. She no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe (though she must still rest to regain spells). She gains an elemental creature's immunity to stunning, and she is no longer subject to extra damage from critical hits or flanking. An elemental savant gains the speed and movement modes, natural attacks, special attacks, and special qualities of a Medium elemental of the type appropriate to her elemental specialty, as noted in the Monster Manual, except that the save DC against her elemental attack form, if any (whirlwind, burn, or vortex) is 20 + her Con modifier. Upon achieving this state, an elemental savant's appearance undergoes a minor physical change, usually to the skin or eyes. An earth elemental savant, for example, might acquire gemlike eyes and hard, pebbly skin. Anyone who shares the elemental savant's predilection for study of her chosen plane immediately recognizes her transcendent nature. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma-based skill and ability checks when interacting with creatures that share her elemental subtype (air, earth, fire, or water) and with other elemental savants who have chosen her element. Unlike a normal elemental, an elemental savant retains a soul separate from her body.

For 1 round, each of her unarmed strike that hits deals an extra 1d6 points of damage (electricity or fire, depending on the choice). At 6th level and higher, an enlightened fist can cause her energy-imbued unarmed strikes to burst with flame or lightning on a critical hit. In addition to dealing an extra 1d6 points of energy damage, her unarmed attacks deal an extra 1d10 points of energy damage on a successful critical hit. If the enlightened fist's unarmed critical multiplier is ?3, she adds an extra 2d10 points of energy damage instead, and if the multiplier is ?4, she adds an extra 3d10 points of energy damage.

Each day, a fatespinner can use a number of points of spin equal to his fatespinner class level. As a free action, a fatespinner can use stored spin to boost the save DC of a spell he casts, adding some or all his spin to the DC, on a point-for-point basis. For instance, a 5th-level wizard/3rd-level fatespinner casting fireball could choose to boost the DC of the spell by 1, 2, or 3 points. Once he uses up his spin for the day, his ability to tinker with probability in this fashion is also exhausted for the day.

The method is identical to increasing a spell's save DC, but the fatespinner can now add spin to any skill check, attack roll, or saving throw that he attempts on a point-for-point basis.

Once per day as a free action, the fatespinner selects a target creature he can see within 30 feet with Hit Dice equal to or less than his. The creature receives either a -10 penalty or a +10 bonus on its next saving throw, as decided by the fatespinner. If the selected target has more Hit Dice than the fatespinner, the ability doesn't work but the use for the day is not wasted. This effect lasts only for 1 round, so if no spell or other effect is brought to bear on the target creature during the round, the creature's fate is no longer sealed.

Spellglyph					KEY:Geometer ~ Spellglyph							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Geometer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:A spellglyph is an arcane diagram that substitutes for a specific spell's verbal and material components (if any). When a geometer casts a prepared spell in conjunction with a spellglyph scribed for that spell, he can cast the spell as if it were affected by the Silent Spell feat. The spellglyph replaces any material components (other than a focus) normally required by the spell. A geometer chooses at the time of casting whether to use a spellglyph. An expended spellglyph disappears, just like any other material component. Spellglyphs are normally scribed on parchment, much like scrolls. Preparing a spellglyph requires 1 hour and the use of rare inks costing 25 gp per spell level. If the spell normally requires an expensive material component (with a value of more than 1 gp), exotic inks and treatments of equal cost must be used in the preparation of the spellglyph.

Every spell he learns from now on requires only a single page in his spellbook. It still takes 24 hours to scribe a spell into a spellbook and materials costing 100 gp per page. A geometer's spellbook is difficult for nongeometers to decipher and use.

As a standard action, a geometer can attempt to pass such a sigil. He must succeed on a level check (DC 6 + the sigil creator's caster level). If successful, he can suppress the effects of the device for as long as he maintains concentration (which might make it possible for others to pass the sigil safely, too).

If the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a Green Star adept, the player must decide to which class to add each adept level for this purpose. For example, a 5th-level wizard/4th-level Green Star adept's caster level would be 9th, due to this ability, but he would only have access to 4th-level spells (5th-level wizard plus two arcane spellcasting class levels from being a 4th-level Green Star adept).

Personal					KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Personal				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:This warding is a sphere whose diameter is equal to an initiate's space (5 feet for Small or Medium creatures, 10 feet for Large, and so on) and encapsulates the initiate. It moves with her, but she cannot force another creature to pass through it (for example, by attempting to grapple an enemy). If she does force a creature to pass through, the warding has no effect on that creature. Any creature striking at her with a melee weapon or natural attack is subject to the veil's effect (although creatures using reach weapons are not). The warding provides concealment to the initiate, but she can see out with no hindrance. It lasts for 1 minute per level or until dismissed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.45
Area						KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Area					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:An area warding affects an initiate's space and all adjacent squares (a sphere 15 feet in diameter for a Small or Medium initiate, 20 feet in diameter for a Large initiate, and so on). Any creature who remains adjacent to the initiate gains the benefit of the warding's protection, even if part of its body lies outside the sphere. Moving out of the warding (stepping away from the initiate) is completely safe, but anyone attempting to enter the warding-even someone who was formerly inside it and left-becomes subject to the effects of the chosen veil. The warding moves with the initiate, but she cannot force another creature to pass through it (for example, by moving adjacent to an enemy). If she does force a creature to pass through, the warding has no effect on that creature. This warding provides concealment to all within from creatures outside, but anyone inside the warding can see out with no hindrance. It lasts for 1 minute per level or until dismissed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.45
Wall						KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Wall					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:This warding takes the form of a wall, up to 10 feet long and 5 feet high per initiate class level. For example, a 3rd-level Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil could create a warding wall 30 feet long and 15 feet high. The wall can be made smaller, but it is not otherwise shapeable. The wall must begin within 30 feet of the initiate, but can extend beyond that distance. The wall is immobile once created. An initiate may choose to make crossing through the wall in one direction safe, if she chooses. In any event, she can pass through her own warding wall with no danger. This warding provides concealment to creatures on either side. It lasts for 10 minutes per level or until dismissed. The save DC for an initiate's warding is equal to 18 + her primary spellcasting ability modifier (Intelligence for wizards, Charisma for sorcerers and bards, and so on). The spell level equivalent of a warding depends on which veil is integrated into it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Veils						KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Veils				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:When an initiate creates a warding, she can choose and imbue the warding with any one veil she knows how to create. These veils duplicate the layers of a prismatic wall and are described below. An initiate's caster level for these veils is equal to her arcane spellcaster level.

Orange Veil					KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Orange Veil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:At 2nd level, an initiate learns the secret of the orange veil. A warding with this veil halts magical ranged attacks, including spells that conjure missiles (such as Melf's acid arrow) or create rays (such as disintegrate or a beholder's eye rays) but not spells that do not require a ranged attack (such as magic missile). A creature crossing an orange veil takes 40 points of acid damage (Reflex half). A gust of wind spell or similar effect destroys the veil but is negated in the process. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.

Yellow Veil					KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Yellow Veil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:An initiate of 3rd level or higher can create a yellow veil. This veil prevents gases or clouds from entering the warded area, and it defeats petrification attacks. In addition, a character inside a personal or area warding imbued with a yellow veil has immunity to poison introduced from outside the warding (such as from a creature with an envenomed weapon striking through the barrier). A creature crossing a yellow veil takes 80 points of electricity damage (Reflex half). A disintegrate spell destroys theveil but is negated in the process. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.

Blue Veil					KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Blue Veil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:At 5th level, an initiate learns the blue veil. This veil blocks all divinations and mind-affecting spells and abilities. Any creature crossing a blue veil must succeed on a Fortitude save or be petrified. A magic missile spell destroys a blue veil but is negated by it. A warding with this is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Indigo Veil					KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Indigo Veil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:A 6th-level initiate can create the mighty indigo veil. This veil prevents the passage of all spells or spell-like abilities. Any creature crossing an indigo veil must succeed on a Will save or become confused, as if by an insanity spell. A daylight spell negates and is negated by an indigo veil. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Violet Veil					KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Violet Veil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:At 7th level, an initiate masters the seventh and final veil: the violet veil. This barrier destroys all objects and effects that cross it, as if they were disintegrated. Living creatures passing a violet veil must succeed on a Will save or be shifted to a random place on a random plane (as the plane shift spell). A violet veil is destroyed by a successful dispel magic spell. A warding with this veil is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.

Reactive Warding				KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Reactive Warding			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality													DESC:At 4th level, an initiate learns to create a warding (see above) in response to an attack. She can raise a warding as an immediate action (see page 86), after an opponent begins an action but before it is completed. For example, if she sees an enemy warrior charging her, she can raise a warding to protect herself. The opponent can choose to continue the charge through the warding or can halt outside it.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Double Warding				KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Double Warding			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:At 6th level and higher, an initiate can raise two veils at once any time she creates a warding. This still counts as only one use of her warding ability. The less powerful effect (progressing from red up through violet) is always considered to be "outside" the more powerful effect, so a double warding consisting of a blue veil and a green veil would subject any creature passing through to the green veil first, followed by the blue veil. To negate the entire warding, the outermost veil must be negated before the inner veil can be negated.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.46
Kaleidoscopic Doom			KEY:Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil ~ Kaleidoscopic Doom		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil Class Feature.SpecialQuality													DESC:At 7th level, an Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil learns the secret of the awesome kaleidoscopic doom. Once per day as a standard action, she designates one creature within 60 feet and turns magical effects currently affecting the creature against it. This effect functions like a targeted greater dispel magic, except that for every spell or effect negated on the target, the effect of one veil (see above) is visited on the victim as if the subject had crossed it. The veils created around the victim proceed through the spectrum from red to violet, with one veil activated per spell negated. Thus, a creature with three spells negated would be subject to the effects of the red, orange, and yellow veils. The subject is still entitled to the normal saving throws allowed by each veil. This ability is the equivalent of a 9thlevel spell.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as the bonus feat sometimes gained by a wizard). If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a mage of the Arcane Order, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Guild Member				KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ Guild Member				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Mage of the Arcane Order Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:A "guild-level" mage of the Arcane Order pays monetary dues and accepts various duties in return for member benefits. The dues are 30 gp per month. Duties include putting in an appearance on campus at least once every six months and accepting any special commissions handed down by senior members. A guildmage who falls into arrears on his dues by more than three months has his membership revoked and loses access to the Spellpool. Reinstating membership is difficult. However, ex-members do not lose any spells or metamagic feats they had gained while in good standing. A member in good standing can board at the Arcane Order campus between adventures, paying only 5 sp per day for common-quality meals and lodging. At his leisure, he can browse the Order's well-respected library, which is stocked with tomes on both mundane and arcane lore (though no spellbooks are kept here). Likewise, he can use the Order's common laboratory facilities when creating magic items (although material costs remain out-of-pocket). Furthermore, he is free to read and post notices to the "job board," a mundane medium whereby fellow members of the Order pass information, advertise their interest in a research topic or adventure, or attempt to sell an interesting oddity, magical or otherwise. Last but not least, members form professional ties with their fellow wizards, possibly leading to lasting friendships or alliances.

New members receive a special focus (a trinket chosen by the spellcaster, such as a ring, brooch, scarf, or other portable item) at the time of their initiation. The focus allows access to the Spellpool and works only for its owner. If a mage of the Arcane Order loses his focus, he must undergo another initiation. The range of available spells increases at 4th and 7th levels.

Regent					KEY:Mage of the Arcane Order ~ Regent					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Mage of the Arcane Order Class Feature.SpecialQuality															DESC:A 10th-level mage of the Arcane Order is awarded the status of regent. A regent gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma-based interaction checks when dealing with lower-level members of the Order. The regents set the Arcane Order's rules and policies, meeting each month in the Council of Regents. A regent must attend six council meetings in one year or be removed from the council and lose his regent status (he loses no other benefits of guild membership, nor does he lose his level in the prestige class). Enacting new policies or eradicating old ones requires a three-fifths majority vote to pass. Generally, the council hands out commissions for lowerlevel mages of the Arcane Order to perform on behalf of the guild. An individual regent might also head up a special group of lower-level members to accomplish a specific goal, such as investigating a crime committed using magic, undertaking an archeological dig of an ancient site of wizardry, or some other important task.

Favored Shape				KEY:Master Transmogrifist ~ Favored Shape					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Master Transmogrifist Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:MasterTransmogrifFavoredShapeLVL|0					DESC:A master transmogrifist chooses three favored shapes at 1st level. A favored shape is a specific kind of creature whose form he can assume by means of the polymorph spell. He cannot choose a creature of his own type (humanoid, most likely) as a favored shape. For example, an 8th-level human sorcerer/1st-level master transmogrifist might choose pegasus, umber hulk, and bronze dragon as his favored shapes, though because of the Hit Dice restriction, he could become only a very young bronze dragon. A master transmogrifist gains a number of advantages with his favored shapes, as noted in the following class feature descriptions. At every odd-numbered level beyond 1st, a master transmogrifist gains one additional favored shape. Thus, he has four at 3rd level, five at 5th level, six at 7th level, and seven at 9th level. Furthermore, once per master transmogrifist level beyond 1st, a character can choose to lose a previously chosen favored shape and select a replacement.

He can choose to apply the benefits of the Still Spell and Silent Spell feats (even if he doesn't have the feats) to any transmutation spell he casts to change into one of his favored shapes.

If he has an appropriate spell prepared and chooses to use this ability, he can change form as an immediate action (see page 86) in response to the action of another creature. For example, a master transmogrifist might turn into a dragon turtle to gain a high Armor Class against an impending attack, or change into a red dragon to gain immunity to the fire damage of an enemy's fire storm spell. The spell is expended as if the transmogrifist had cast it normally, and he remains in his new form until either the spell's duration expires or he dismisses it. A transmogrifist gives up his next action to make a reflexive change. If a master transmogrifist is currently under the effect of a shapechange spell he cast on himself, he can use his reflexive change ability as often as he likes (although never more than once per round).

To create an imaginary form, he chooses one of his favored shapes as a base form. He can then choose a single aspect of a second monster whose form he could assume using the spell he is casting and add it to the first creature. His available options include the following. . Replace the base form's natural armor bonus with that of the second form. . Add the second form's movement modes. . Add one of the second form's natural attack types (with the appropriate reach), if the base form doesn't have that attack type already. . Add an extraordinary special attack of the second form. . Add an extraordinary special quality of the second form. . Replace one of the base form's physical ability scores, if both the base form and the second form are the same size category. For example, if a young red dragon is the base form and a giant octopus is the second, a master transmogrifist could add the octopus's eight tentacle rakes (damage 1d4 + Str bonus) to the dragon's available natural attacks.

If he attempts to use this power on a creature while he has another so charmed, the first charm is automatically broken (regardless of the success of the second attempt). The effect is also broken if a mindbender or one of his allies injures the target. Dispel magic has no effect on an eternal charm, though break enchantment frees the victim (treat the mindbender's caster level as 5 + his class level for this purpose). At 6th level and higher, a mindbender can have up to two creatures affected by this power at any given time; if he attempts to charm a third, the previous victim under his influence the longest is freed.

The subject is entitled to a Will save (DC 10 + sublime chord level + Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If the subject fails its save, it is frozen in a shimmering aura of timelessness and can take no actions. However, no force can affect it-weapons cannot reach it, spells that target it automatically fail, and if the ground it is standing on is somehow taken away, it would not even begin to fall. A sublime chord can keep her target frozen in time for as long as she maintains the power by continuing to perform, up to a maximum of 1 minute per level.

The duration of any of his Suel arcanamach spells with which he targets himself is doubled, as if affected by the Extend Spell feat (but without any adjustment to the spell's effective level or casting time). For instance, a bull's strength spell cast by a 3rd-level Suel arcanamach on himself has a duration of 6 minutes rather than 3 minutes. Spells that target multiple targets are affected by this power, but only the arcanamach gains the extended duration. For example, a 5th-level arcanamach who casts haste would be hasted for 10 rounds, while his allies would gain the effect only for the normal 5-round duration.

Caster level affects all level-based variables of a spell, including spell penetration checks.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Random Deflector				KEY:Wild Mage ~ Random Deflector						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Wild Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DEFINE:WildMageRandomDeflectorLVL|0						DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a wild mage has the ability to protect herself from certain attacks with this ability. Using this ability is an immediate action (see page 86), which means that a wild mage activates it when it is not her turn. When activated, the random deflector lasts until the beginning of the wild mage's next turn. The random deflector redirects ranged attacks, ranged touch attacks, and individually targeted spells (spells designating the wild mage as the sole target, but not area spells striking an area in which she happens to be the sole target) so that they instead attack or affect a random target within 20 feet of the wild mage. A wild mage includes herself and her allies among the possible new targets. Any creature targeted by a deflected attack is attacked or affected normally, so an attack roll is made normally against the new target's AC, the new target receives a saving throw if a spell or effect allows one, and so on. A wild mage can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, two times per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 8th level.																																																																																																																																																																																					BONUS:VAR|RandomDeflectorPerDay|(WildMageRandomDeflectorLVL+1)/3																							SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Student of Chaos				KEY:Wild Mage ~ Student of Chaos						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Wild Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:Whenever a wild mage of 3rd level or higher uses a magic item that offers a randomly determined effect (such as a bag of tricks or rod of wonder), she can roll twice and choose between the two results. If a random roll is made only once to determine the nature or contents of a device (for example, a robe of useful items or an iron flask), a wild mage gains no special advantage.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Chaotic Mind				KEY:Wild Mage ~ Chaotic Mind							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Wild Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:When a wild mage reaches 6th level, the power of chaos infuses her mind. She gains immunity to confusion and insanity spells and effects, and she is shielded by a continuous nondetection effect (as the spell).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.70
Reckless Dweomer				KEY:Wild Mage ~ Reckless Dweomer						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Wild Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 9th level and higher, a wild mage knows how to spontaneously convert her own spell energy into random, unpredictable results. As a standard action, she can eliminate a prepared spell or spell slot of at least 1st level to create an effect similar to that of activating a rod of wonder. The character's student of chaos ability (see above) applies when she uses her reckless dweomer ability. See page 237 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on the rod of wonder.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.70
Wildstrike					KEY:Wild Mage ~ Wildstrike							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Wild Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality																DESC:At 10th level, a wild mage gains the ability to make a wildstrike once per day. A wildstrike affects a single creature within 60 feet, surrounding the creature in an aura of shimmering rainbow colors for 2d6 rounds. Spell resistance applies, but the target receives no saving throw. While a wildstrike is in effect, there is a 50%% chance each time the affected creature casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability that its intended action fails. Instead, the creature rolls as if it had activated a rod of wonder (see page 237 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Any spellcaster within 40 feet of a chaggrin who casts a spell with the same descriptor as the grue's element (earth, fire, air, or water) must succeed on a DC 15 caster level check or have the spell fail.

Basically, the chaggrin's attack deals extra damage any time its target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the chaggrin flanks its target.

Whirlwind						KEY:Air Monolith ~ Whirlwind				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Air Monolith Race Trait.SpecialQuality								DESC:An air monolith can transform itself into a whirlwind at will as a standard action and remain in that form indefinitely. In this form, the monolith can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed. The whirlwind is 10 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The monolith controls the exact height, but it must be at least 20 feet. The air monolith's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the monolith enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the monolith moves into or through the creature's space. Huge or smaller creatures take damage when caught in a whirlwind and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 39 Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take 4d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 39 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based. A creature trapped in a whirlwind cannot move except to go where the air monolith carries it or to escape the whirlwind. It can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in a whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. A monolith can have only as many creatures trapped inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume. An air monolith can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned monolith always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane. If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the air monolith and has a diameter equal to half the monolith's height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. An air monolith in whirlwind form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it.																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.156

Unless it is still in contact with the fire monolith, a burning creature can take a move action to put out the flames. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The vortex is 10 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. The monolith controls the exact height, but it must be at least 20 feet. A water monolith's movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the monolith enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the monolith moves into or through the creature's space. Huge or smaller creatures take damage when caught in a vortex and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 42 Reflex save when it comes into contact with a vortex or take 4d6 points of damage. It must also succeed on a second DC 42 Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave if the save is successful. The save DC is Strength-based. A creature trapped in a vortex cannot move except to go where the water monolith carries it or to escape the vortex.

A water monolith can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be.
