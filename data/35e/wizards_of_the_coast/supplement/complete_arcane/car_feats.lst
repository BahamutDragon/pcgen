Arcane Defense			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus																																																															DESC:Choose a school of magic, such as illusion. You can resist spells from that school better than normal.																			STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SCHOOLS|ABILITY=FEAT[Spell Focus]		SELECT:1																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.73	BENEFIT:You get a +3 bonus on your saving throws against spells from the chosen school.
Arcane Mastery			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Ability to cast arcane spells or use spelllike abilities (including invocations).																DESC:You are quick and certain in your efforts to defeat the arcane defenses and spells of others.																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.73	BENEFIT:You can take 10 on caster level checks (as if the caster level check was a skill check).
Arcane Preparation		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.																					DESC:You can prepare an arcane spell ahead of time, just as a wizard does.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.73	BENEFIT:Each day, you can use one or more of your spell slots to prepare spells you know, usually for the purpose of applying a metamagic feat to the spellbut without an increase in its casting time. Preparing a spell uses a spell slot of the appropriate level, and once prepared, that slot cant be used for anything else until the prepared spell is cast.
Battle Caster			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Ability to ignore arcane spell failure chance from armor.																				DESC:Building on your existing training allows you to avoid the chance of arcane spell failure when you wear armor heavier than normal.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.75	BENEFIT:You are able to wear armor one category heavier than you can normally wear while still avoiding the chance of arcane spell failure. For example, if you have the ability to normally wear light armor without incurring a chance of spell failure, you can wear medium armor and continue to cast spells as normal. This ability does not extend to shields, nor does it apply to spells gained from spellcasting classes other than the class that provides the ability to cast arcane spells while in armor.
Black Lore of Moil		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic		PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=7		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (Necromancy)																																																													DESC:Your study of the sinister knowledge and spellcasting techniques of the long-dead Nightlords of Moil makes your necromancy spells especially potent.																																ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																															SOURCEPAGE:p.75	BENEFIT:Any necromancy spell you cast can be cast instead as a Moilian spell, dealing an extra 1d6 points of negative energy damage +1d6 per two spell levels (+1d6 for 1st-level spells, +2d6 for 2nd- or 3rd-level spells, and so on). If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the target takes half the negative energy damage on a successful save, regardless of the outcome of the save on the spells normal effect. In addition to its normal spell components, a Moilian spell requires the creation and expenditure of a Moilian runebonea small human bone (often a finger bone) scribed with carefully prepared arcane markings. Only a character trained in the Black Lore of Moil knows the secrets of creating a runebone, which takes 1 hour to craft and requires special inks and powders costing 25 gp per die of negative energy damage to be generated. For example, a runebone capable of adding 3d6 points of negative energy damage to a spell costs 75 gp to craft. While the maximum negative energy damage dealt by a Moilian spell is based on the spells level, the actual damage is limited by the runebone. For example, if a sorcerer casts finger of death (a 7th-level spell, so normally +4d6) with a 75-gp (3d6) runebone, the spell deals only 3d6 points of additional negative energy damage.
Born of the Three Thunders	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Energy Substitution (Electricity)																PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Nature)=4																																						DESC:You have learned to marry the power of lightning and thunder in your electricity and sonic spells.																																								ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																															SOURCEPAGE:p.76	BENEFIT:When you cast a spell with either the electricity descriptor or the sonic descriptor that deals hit point damage, you can declare that spell to be a spell of the three thunders, with half its damage dealt as electricity damage and half dealt as sonic damage. In addition, the spell concludes with a mighty thunderclap that stuns all creatures that take damage from the spell for 1 round unless they succeed on a Fortitude save, then knocks stunned creatures prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save (both saves at the same DC as the base spell). Channeling the three thunders is costly, though, and you are automatically dazed for 1 round after doing so.
Chain Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:You can cast spells that arc to other targets in addition to the primary target.																																											ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																															SOURCEPAGE:p.76	BENEFIT:Any spell that specifies a single target and has a range greater than touch can be chained so as to affect that primary target normally, then arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Each arc affects one secondary target chosen by you, all of which must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and none of which can be affected more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum. If the chained spell deals damage, the secondary targets each take half as much damage as the primary target (rounded down) and can attempt Reflex saving throws for half damage (whether the spell allows the original target a save or not). For spells that dont deal damage, the save DCs against arcing effects are reduced by 4. For example, if a 10th-level wizard normally casts cause fear at DC 14, a chained cause fear could target a goblin chieftain at DC 14 and up to ten of his nearby guards at DC 10.
Collegiate Wizard			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,Wizard=1																			PRELEVEL:MAX=1																	PRESTAT:1,INT=13																																DESC:You have undergone extensive training in a formal school for wizards.																																																																BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (Arcana)|2									SOURCEPAGE:p.181	BENEFIT:You begin play with knowledge of six 1st-level spells plus 1 per point of Intelligence modifier. Each time you gain a wizard level, you may add four spells to your spellbook without additional research. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (Arcana) checks.
Communicator			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																															SPELLS:Innate|TIMES=1|Arcane Mark|Comprehend Languages|Message					DESC:You possess a magical understanding of the essence of language.																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.76	BENEFIT:An innate talent for magic grants you the following spell-like abilities as a 1st-level caster: 1/day - Arcane Mark, Comprehend Languages, Message.
Cooperative Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:You can cast spells to greater effect in conjunction with the same spell cast by another individual.																																								ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																															SOURCEPAGE:p.76	BENEFIT:While the two of you are adjacent, you and another spellcaster with the Cooperative Spell feat can simultaneously cast the same spell at the same time in the round. Add +2 to the save DC of cooperatively cast spells and +1 to caster level checks to beat the targets spell resistance (if any), using the higher base DC and level check of either caster.
Craft Contingent Spell		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.ItemCreation	PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=11																																																																							DESC:You know how to attach semipermanent spells to a creature and set them to activate under certain conditions.																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.77	BENEFIT:You can make contingent any spell that you know. Crafting a contingent spell takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price (spell level  caster level  100 gp). To craft a contingent spell, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the base price. Some spells incur extra costs in material components or XP (as noted in their descriptions), which must be paid when the contingent spell is created.
Delay Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:You can cast spells that take effect after a short delay of your choosing.																																												ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																															SOURCEPAGE:p.77	BENEFIT:When casting a spell, you set a delay of 1 to 5 rounds before it takes effect. The delay time cannot be changed once set; the spell activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only area, personal, and touch spells can be affected by this feat. Any decisions you would make about the spell (including attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an area) are decided when the spell is cast, with any of its effects (including damage and saving throws) decided when the spell triggers. If conditions change during the delay period in ways that would make the spell impossible to cast (the target you designate moves beyond the spells range, for example), the spell fails. During the delay period, a delayed spell can be dispelled normally, and it can be detected in the area or on the target (as applicable).
Double Wand Wielder		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wand,Two-Weapon Fighting																																																												DESC:You can activate two wands at the same time.																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.77	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can wield a wand in each hand (if you have both hands free), with one wand designated as your primary wand and the other your secondary wand. Each use of the secondary wand expends 2 charges from it instead of 1.
Energy Admixture			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Energy Substitution																																																														DESC:You can modify a spell that uses one type of energy to add an equal amount of another energy type.																					MULT:YES	CHOOSE:STRING|Acid|Cold|Electricity|Fire		SELECT:1																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.78	BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) that matches an energy type you have selected for substitution via the Energy Substitution feat. You can then modify any spell with an energy descriptor by adding an equal amount of the chosen type of energy to the spells normal effects. The altered spell works normally in all respects except for the type and amount of damage dealt, with each type of energy counting separately toward the spells damage cap. Thus, an acid fireball cast at 6th level deals 6d6 points of fire damage and 6d6 points of acid damage (rolled separately), while the same acid fireball cast at 10th level or higher deals 10d6 points of fire damage and 10d6 points of acid damage. Even opposed types of energy (such as fire and cold) can be combined using this feat.
Energy Substitution		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																			PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Arcana)=5																																							DESC:You can modify an energy-based spell to use another type of energy instead.																									MULT:YES	CHOOSE:STRING|Acid|Cold|Electricity|Fire											ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																															SOURCEPAGE:p.79	BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). You can then modify any spell with an energy descriptor to use the chosen type of energy instead. An energy substituted spell uses a spell slot of the spells normal level. The spells descriptor changes to the new energy typefor example, a fireball composed of cold energy is an evocation [cold] spell.
Explosive Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																																																																													DESC:You can cast spells that blast creatures off their feet.																																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																															SOURCEPAGE:p.79	BENEFIT:On a failed Reflex save, an explosive spell ejects any creature caught in its area, sending it to a location outside the nearest edge of that area, dealing additional damage and further knocking creatures prone.
Extra Edge				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,Warmage=4																																																																								DESC:Your ability to deal spell damage is particularly striking.																																																																								BONUS:VAR|WarmageEdge|1+(var("CL=Warmage")/4)	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	BENEFIT:You gain a +1 bonus on your warmage edge, plus an additional +1 bonus per four warmage levels. For instance, an 8th-level warmage with 18 Intelligence gets a +7 bonus on the damage dealt by any spell that deals hit point damage.
Extra Invocation			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE=Lesser Invocation																																																											DESC:You learn an additional invocation.																														STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.79	BENEFIT:You learn one additional invocation from the list available to you, choosing an invocation of one grade lower than the highest grade of invocation you know. For example, a 6th level warlock could learn a least invocation, while a 16th-level warlock could learn any least, lesser, or greater invocation.		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Warlock Invocation Selection|1
Extra Slot				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=4																																																																							DESC:You can cast an additional spell.																														STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SPELLLEVEL|SpellType=Arcane|0|MAXLEVEL|SpellType=Divine|0|MAXLEVEL	BONUS:SPELLCAST|%LIST|1																																				BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Bonus Spell Cast Selection|1																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.79	BENEFIT:You gain one extra spell slot in your daily allotment, at any level up to one lower than the highest level of spell you can currently cast. For example, a 4th-level sorcerer (maximum spell level 2nd) gains either an extra 0-level or 1st level slot, and is able to cast any spell he knows of the chosen level one more time each day. Likewise, a 4th-level wizard can prepare any extra 0-level or 1st-level spell he knows. Once selected, the extra spell slot never changes level.
Extra Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=3																																																																							DESC:You learn an additional spell.																															STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																		BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Bonus Spell Known Selection|1																							SOURCEPAGE:p.79	BENEFIT:You learn one additional spell at any level up to one lower than the highest level of spell you can currently cast. Thus, a 4th-level sorcerer (maximum spell level 2nd) gains a new 0-level or 1st-level spell known with which to expand her repertoire. For classes such as wizard that have more options for learning spells, Extra Spell is generally used to learn a specific spell that the character lacks access to and would be unable to research.
Extra Spell Secret		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE.SpellSecret																									PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=2,Divine=2																																DESC:You learn an additional spell secret.																													STACK:YES	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.80	BENEFIT:You choose one spell known to you that becomes permanently modified as though affected by Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Still Spell, or Silent Spell. The spells level does not change, nor does the choice of spell and modification once chosen. As you go up in level, you can choose the same spell to be modified in different ways with multiple spell secrets (either from additional uses of this feat or through the spell secret class ability). You do not need to have the metamagic feat that you apply to the spell.
Fortify Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																																																																													DESC:You cast spells that more easily penetrate spell resistance.																																															ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																															SOURCEPAGE:p.80	BENEFIT:A fortified spell is treated as having a higher caster level for the purpose of defeating a targets spell resistance. You prepare and cast the spell in a higher-level spell slot than normal, with each additional level giving a +2 bonus on spell penetration checks for the altered spell. Spells that are not subject to spell resistance are not affected.
Guardian Spirit			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																												PRESA:1,Watchful Spirit																																															DESC:Your watchful spirit is more capable than normal.																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	BENEFIT:Your watchful spirit allows you to reroll your initiative two times per day, as well as allowing you to reroll any saving throw once per day.

Innate Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Quicken Spell,Silent Spell,Still Spell																																																											DESC:You have mastered a spell so thoroughly that you can now use it as a spell-like ability.																																																																						MULT:YES	SELECT:1			CHOOSE:SPELLS|ALL[KNOWN=YES]																																																																																																																										ADDSPELLLEVEL:8																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.80				BENEFIT:Choose any spell you can cast. You can now cast this spell at will as a spell-like ability once per round. One spell slot eight levels higher than the innate spell is permanently used to power it, and any XP cost for the innate spell is paid each time you use it.

SOURCEPAGE:p.80
Lord of the Uttercold		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Energy Substitution (Cold)																	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (The Planes)=9											PRETEXT:ability to cast a spell with the cold descriptor																			DESC:Through careful study of the Elemental Planes and their interactions with the Negative Energy Plane, you have learned to wield the uttercold.																																	ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																															SOURCEPAGE:p.80	BENEFIT:You can turn spells with the cold descriptor into uttercold spells. Half the damage dealt by an uttercold spell is cold damage, and the other half is negative energy damage. The spells saving throw remains unchanged, but creatures can apply cold resistance or immunity to cold only to the cold portion of the damage. An undead creature can be healed by the negative energy damage of an uttercold spell, though if it doesnt have resistance to cold, the effects of damage and healing cancel each other out.
Mage Slayer				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=2																																											DESC:You have studied the ways and weaknesses of spellcasters and can time your attacks and defenses against them expertly.																																																BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|TYPE.Arcane,TYPE.Divine|-4															SOURCEPAGE:p.81	BENEFIT:You gain a +1 bonus on Will saving throws.

All variable, numeric effects of the spelllike ability are maximized, dealing maximum damage, curing the maximum number of hit points, affecting the maximum number of targets, and so on. For example, a 10th-level warlocks maximized eldritch blast deals 36 points of damage three times per day. Saving throws and opposed checks (such as the one you make when you cast dispel magic) are not affected, nor are spell-like abilities without random variables.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																															SOURCEPAGE:p.81	BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). You can then modify any spell with the chosen descriptor to deal nonlethal damage instead of normal energy damage. The nonlethal spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealtfor example, a nonlethal fireball has the same range and area, but since it deals nonlethal damage instead of energy damage, it will not damage objects or set fire to combustibles in the area.
Obtain Familiar			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=3																								PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Arcana)=4																																									DESC:You gain a familiar.																																													ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Familiar																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.81	BENEFIT:You can obtain a familiar in the same manner as a sorcerer or wizard (see the sorcerer class description and the accompanying sidebar, page 52 of the Players Handbook).

Persistent Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extend Spell																																																															DESC:You can make a spell last all day.																																																			ADDSPELLLEVEL:6																															SOURCEPAGE:p.81	BENEFIT:Spells with a fixed or personal range can have their duration increased to 24 hours. Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effects are discharged.

Pierce Magical Concealment	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blind-Fight,Mage Slayer																														PRESTAT:1,CON=13																													DESC:You ignore the miss chance provided by certain magical effects.																																																									BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|TYPE.Arcane,TYPE.Divine|-4															SOURCEPAGE:p.81	BENEFIT:Your fierce contempt for magic allows you to disregard the miss chance granted by spells or spell-like abilities such as darkness, blur, invisibility, obscuring mist, ghostform (see page 109), and spells when used to create concealment effects (such as a wizard using permanent image to fill a corridor with illusory fire and smoke). In addition, when facing a creature protected by mirror image, you can immediately pick out the real creature from its figments. Your ability to ignore the miss chance granted by magical concealment doesnt grant you any ability to ignore nonmagical concealment (so you would still have a 20%% miss chance against an invisible creature hiding in fog, for example).
Pierce Magical Protection	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Mage Slayer																																PRESTAT:1,CON=13																													DESC:You can overcome the magical protections of your enemies.																																																										BONUS:CASTERLEVEL|TYPE.Arcane,TYPE.Divine|-4															SOURCEPAGE:p.82	BENEFIT:Your contempt for magic is so fierce that as a standard action you can make a melee attack that ignores any bonuses to Armor Class granted by spells (including spell trigger or spell completion effects created by magic items such as wands or potions). If you deal damage to your opponent, you also instantly and automatically dispel all that opponents spells and spell effects that grant a bonus to Armor Class.
Precocious Apprentice		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Arcane=1	PRESTAT:1,INT=15,CHA=15	PRETEXT:1st level ONLY																																	PRESTAT:1,INT=15,CHA=15	PRETEXT:Spell stat must be 15+																				DESC:Your master has shown you the basics of a spell beyond the normal limits of your experience and training.

You gain an extra 2nd-level spell slot that must be used initially to cast only the chosen spell. Until your level is high enough to allow you to cast 2nd-level spells, you must succeed on a DC 8 caster level check to successfully cast this spell; if you fail, the spell is miscast to no effect. Your caster level with the chosen spell is your normal caster level, even if this level is insufficient to cast the spell under normal circumstances. When you become able to cast 2nd-level spells, you lose the benefit described above but retain the extra 2nd-level spell slot, which you can use to prepare or spontaneously cast a spell of 2nd level or lower as you normally would. Finally, you gain a +2 bonus on all Spellcraft checks.
Ranged Spell Specialization	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=4		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Focus (Ranged Spell)																																																												DESC:You deal more damage with ranged touch attack spells.																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	BENEFIT:Damage-dealing spells that require a ranged touch attack roll gain a +2 bonus on the damage they deal. This extra damage applies only to the first successful attack of spells that create multiple rays or missiles, or to the first round of damage for spells that deal damage over multiple rounds on a single successful attack (such as Melfs acid arrow). Because you must be able to strike precisely, the extra damage applies only to targets within 30 feet. Only spells that deal hit point damage can be affected by this feat.
Reckless Wand Wielder		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Craft Wand																				PRESKILL:1,Use Magic Device=1																																							DESC:You can increase the effectiveness of spells cast from a wand.																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.82	BENEFIT:By expending an additional charge, you can use a wand as if its caster level was 2 higher than its normal level, changing all the spells level-dependent effects. For example, by expending 2 charges at once, a wand of magic missile (created at caster level 3rd) can be used at caster level 5th, firing three missiles instead of two. You can expend only 1 extra charge at a time using this feat.
Repeat Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:You can cast a spell that repeats on the following round.																																																																																																																				ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.82			BENEFIT:A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your turn in the following round. No matter where you might have moved in the previous round, the second spell originates from the same location and affects the same area as the original spell. If the original spell designates a ranged target, the repeated spell affects the same target if it is within 30 feet of its original position; otherwise, the second spell fails. Touch range spells cannot be affected by this feat.
Sanctum Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:Your spells are especially potent on home ground.																																																ADDSPELLLEVEL:0																															SOURCEPAGE:p.82	BENEFIT:A sanctum spell has an effective spell level 1 higher than its normal level if cast in your sanctum (see below), but if not cast in the sanctum, the spell has an effective spell level 1 lower than normal. All effects dependent on spell level (including save DCs) are calculated according to the adjusted level.
Sculpt Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:You can alter the area of your spells.																																																		ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																															SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:You can modify an area spell by changing the areas shape to either a cylinder (10-foot radius, 30 feet high), a 40-foot cone, four 10-foot cubes, a ball (20-foot-radius spread), or a 120-foot line. The sculpted spell works normally in all respects except for its shape. For example, a lightning bolt whose area is changed to a ball deals the same amount of damage, but affects a 20-foot-radius spread.	SOURCEPAGE:p.83

ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																															SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:You can cause any ray spell to fire one additional ray beyond the number normally allowed. The additional ray requires a separate ranged touch attack roll to hit and deals damage as normal. It can be fired at the same target as the first ray or at a different target, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.
Sudden Empower			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:You can cast a spell to greater effect without special preparation.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can apply the effect of the Empower Spell feat to any spell you cast without increasing the level of the spell or specially preparing it ahead of time. You can still use Empower Spell normally if you have it.
# COMMENT: This feat is not in the book proper, but is listed in the Warmage class. Adding for completeness
Sudden Enlarge			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic																																																																														DESC:You may cast one spell per day with a greater range than normal without special preparation.

Touch Spell Specialization	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General			PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=4		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Weapon Focus (Touch Spell)																																																													DESC:You deal extra damage with touch spells.																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.83	BENEFIT:Damage-dealing spells that require a melee touch attack roll gain a +2 bonus on the damage they deal. This extra damage applies only to the first successful attack of spells that allow multiple touch attacks (such as chill touch). Only spells that deal hit point damage can be affected by this feat.
Transdimensional Spell		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic																																																																													DESC:You can cast spells that affect targets lurking in coexistent planes and extradimensional spaces whose entrances fall within the spells area.																																	ADDSPELLLEVEL:1																															SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:A transdimensional spell has its full normal effect on incorporeal creatures, creatures on the Ethereal Plane or the Plane of Shadow, and creatures within an extradimensional space in the spells area. Such creatures include ethereal creatures, creatures that are blinking or shadow walking, manifested ghosts, and creatures within the extradimensional space of a rope trick, portable hole, or familiar pocket (see page 106). You must be able to perceive a creature to target it with a transdimensional spell, but you do not need to perceive a creature to catch it in the area of a burst, cone, emanation, or spread.
Twin Spell				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Metamagic								PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,TYPE=Metamagic																																																															DESC:You can simultaneously cast a single spell twice.																																																ADDSPELLLEVEL:4																															SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:Casting a twinned spell causes the spell to take effect twice in the same area or on the same target simultaneously. Any variable characteristics (including attack rolls) or decisions you would make about the spell (including target and area), are applied to both spells, with affected creatures receiving all the effects of each spell individually (including getting two saving throws if applicable). A spell whose effects wouldnt stack if it was cast twice under normal circumstances will create redundant effects if successfully twinned (see Combining Magical Effects, page 171 of the Players Handbook). For example, a twinned charm person doesnt create a more potent or long-lasting effect, but any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling, so a single successful counterspell negates both instances of a twinned spell.
Wand Strike				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																PRESKILL:1,Use Magic Device=4																																										DESC:You can channel the magical energy of a wand through your melee attacks.																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.84	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack with a wand, expending one charge to deal 1d6 points of damage to the creature struck. You apply no extra damage to this attack regardless of its source (including sneak attack, favored enemy, and smite bonuses), but you can activate the wand as part of the attack. If the spell cast from the wand is a ray or a targeted spell, the creature struck is the spells target (with ray spells hitting automatically). If the spell affects an area or creates a spread, you can designate the spells point of origin at any grid intersection point of the creatures space (but doing so might put you in the affected area). Spells with an effect that does not cover an area (such as the various summon monster spells) cannot be used with a wandstrike attack.
