# Equipment Name		Unique Key				Required Weapon Proficiency				Type									Alt Type								Cost		Weight	Crit Mult	Crit Range	Damage	Alt Damage		Size		Source Page		Special Property
Barbed Dagger		KEY:Dagger (Barbed)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Dagger (Barbed)			TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing												COST:35	WT:1		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d4				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.115	SPROP:Barbed daggers, as their name implies, look like normal daggers with long barbs covering the blade. The design makes the weapon more difficult to wield properly than a normal dagger, but it allows those skilled in the weapon's use to deal more damage with a well-placed attack. If you have 5 or more ranks in Sleight of Hand and use a barbed dagger, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls on any successful sneak attack made with the weapon as it twists in the wound. This bonus also applies (and is therefore doubled) on successful critical hits with the weapon. Characters proficient with the barbed dagger can treat it as a dagger for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Broadblade Short Sword	KEY:Sword (Short/Broadblade)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sword (Short/Broadblade)	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.Light.Piercing												COST:75	WT:3		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d6				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:117	SPROP:Sword, Short, Broadblade: Broadblade short swords have a wider blade and crossguard than normal swords. This feature makes them more difficult to wield in combat, but the design allows skilled users to defend themselves better when fighting cautiously. If you are proficient with the broadblade short sword and you fight defensively or employ the total defense combat maneuver, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the rest of the round in addition to the normal AC bonus from the combat maneuver (+2 for fighting defensively or +4 for total defense). This bonus also applies if you are proficient with the weapon, have the Combat Expertise feat, and shift at least 2 points of your attack bonus to AC for the round. Because of its benefit when fighting defensively, the broadblade short sword is a popular off-hand weapon. Characters proficient with the broadblade short sword can treat it as a short sword for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Quickblade Rapier		KEY:Rapier (Quickblade)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Rapier (Quickblade)		TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.OneHanded.Piercing											COST:75	WT:3		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:3	DAMAGE:1d6				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:116	SPROP:Quickblade rapiers are longer and thinner than normal rapiers, with specially tapered blades and carefully balanced pommels. The design makes the weapon more difficult to wield properly than a normal rapier, but it allows those skilled in the weapon's use to disarm opponents more easily and to feint more effectively in combat. Most quickblade rapiers are at least masterwork in quality. If you are proficient with the quickblade rapier, you gain a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an enemy (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat (see page 102 of the Player's Handbook) to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a quickblade rapier sized for you. You can't use a quickblade rapier in two hands to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage. Characters proficient with the quickblade rapier can treat it as a rapier for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Longaxe			KEY:Longaxe				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Longaxe				TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Piercing											COST:35	WT:15		CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d12				SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:115	SPROP:A longaxe looks like a greataxe with an elongated haft. This feature makes the weapon awkward to wield by those unfamiliar with its use, but those proficient with the weapon can use the haft's extra length to attack foes more than 5 feet away as long as they are willing to forgo precision in favor of dealing extra damage. If you are proficient with the longaxe, you can treat it as a reach weapon any time you use the Power Attack feat to shift 3 or more points of your attack bonus from attack to damage. When you use a longaxe in this manner, you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you cannot use it against an adjacent foe. Because you determine the use of the Power Attack feat for an entire turn, you must wield the longaxe as either a reach weapon or a normal weapon until the beginning of your next turn once you make the decision. You cannot wield it as both a reach weapon and a normal weapon in the same turn. Characters proficient with the longaxe can treat it as a greataxe for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip
Longstaff			KEY:Longstaff			PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Longstaff				TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning.Double	ALTTYPE:Weapon.Melee.Exotic.TwoHanded.Bludgeoning	COST:15	WT:6		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6	ALTDAMAGE:1d6	SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:116	SPROP:As its name implies, the longstaff is a longer version of the quarterstaff. The extra length makes the weapon much more difficult to use, but those skilled in its use are better able to protect themselves from multiple attackers when fighting cautiously. If you are proficient with the longstaff and you fight defensively or employ the total defense combat maneuver, you cannot be flanked for the rest of the round. This benefit also applies if you are proficient in the weapon, have the Combat Expertise feat, and shift at least 2 points of your attack bonus to AC for the round. A longstaff is a double weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were fighting with a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see Two- Weapon Fighting, page 160 of the Player's Handbook). You can also strike with either end singly. A creature wielding a longstaff in one hand can't use it as a double weapon-only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round. The longstaff is a special monk weapon. This designation gives a monk wielding a longstaff special options (see the flurry of blows description, page 40 of the Player's Handbook). Characters proficient with the longstaff can treat it as a quarterstaff for the purpose of any of the following feats: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullEquip

###Block: Alchemical Items
# Equipment Name				Unique Key						Type									Cost		Weight	Source Page		Bonus to skill													Modify VAR																				Special Property
Blend Cream												TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:50	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:This pale gray cream dulls the color of flesh, fur, scales, and hair. It allows those affected to better blend with background and shadow, making it easier to hide. Applying blend cream is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Blend cream provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Hide checks. The effects of blend cream last for 1 hour. Blend cream gives no ability to hide in plain sight or without sufficient cover.
Candle, Focusing				KEY:Candle (Focusing)				TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:100	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:This large green taper burns quickly, lasting only 1 hour despite its size. While burning, a focusing candle fills the air with a fresh, crisp odor. The candle is a great boon to those engaged in strenuous mental activity. Characters within 20 feet of a burning candle gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Appraise, Decipher Script, Forgery, and Search checks. When making a skill check that takes more than one action to complete (such as Decipher Script), characters gain the bonus from a focusing candle only if they spend the entire duration of the check within 20 feet of the burning candle.
Catstink												TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:A dose of this alchemical compound sprinkled on your trail temporarily confuses the scent ability of any creature. Any creature using scent to track you must succeed on a DC 15 Survival check or lose your trail. If the trail is lost, the creature can attempt to relocate it using the normal rules for the Track feat, but the check DC increases by 2. The odor of catstink remains in effect for 10 minutes after the substance is used. Sprinkling catstink on one's trail is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Fareye Oil												TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:25	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:When applied to the eyes, this clear oil sharpens the user's vision for a short time, providing a +1 alchemical bonus on Spot checks for 1 minute. One dose of fareye oil is enough to affect the eyes of a creature of any size, but the creature must have eyes to gain any benefit from the oil. Applying fareye oil is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Flash Pellet											TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:This tiny brittle object is often disguised as a button or other decoration. You can throw a flash pellet as a ranged attack with a range increment of 5 feet. When thrown against a hard surface, it bursts with a bright flash of light. All creatures within a 5-foot-radius burst must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 round after that.
Freeglide												TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:This greenish-gray gel can be applied to a creature's hide, hair, clothing, or armor. The gel makes the affected surface slippery and hard to grab or hold, providing a +1 alchemical bonus on Escape Artist checks for 1 hour. One dose of freeglide is enough to coat one Medium creature. Applying freeglide is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If freeglide is applied over clothing or armor, its benefits are lost if the armor or clothing is removed. Likewise, if it is applied to a creature's skin or hide, its benefit is lost if the creature later dons clothing or armor.
Hawk's Ointment											TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:This thick, acidic gel temporarily sharpens the user's vision. Once its beneficial effects wear off, however, the gel burns and stings the eyes for a few minutes. After spreading the gel over her eyes, a character gains a +1 bonus on Search and Spot checks for 2 minutes. After that time, she takes a -2 penalty on Search and Spot checks for 10 minutes. Characters can halve the remaining duration of the penalty by spending a round washing out their eyes with clean water. Applying hawk's ointment or washing out one's eyes is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Healer's Balm											TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:10	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:This smooth, sweet-smelling balm allows a healer to better soothe the effects of wounds, disease, and poison. Healer's balm provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Heal checks made to help an affected creature. The effects of healer's balm last for 1 minute. One dose of healer's balm is enough to coat one Medium creature. Applying healer's balm is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. It can be applied as part of a standard action made to administer first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison.
Keenear Powder											TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.118																																					SPROP:This dry white powder sharpens a creature's hearing when applied to the ear. The powder is effective for only a short time, so it is more often used by those trying to avoid guards or sentries than by those tasked with guarding an area for a longer time. Keenear powder provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Listen checks for 1 minute. One dose of keenear powder is enough to affect the hearing of a creature of any size, but the creature must have ears to gain any benefit from the powder. Applying keenear powder is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Lockslip Grease											TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.119																																					SPROP:Lockslip grease is a thick reddish oil that loosens the mechanical workings of nonmagical locks. The grease is effective for a short time and provides a slight edge to those attempting to pick a lock. Lockslip grease provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Open Lock checks made against the affected lock for 1 minute. One dose of lockslip grease is enough to affect the mechanism of a lock of any size. Although lockslip grease can affect any kind of mundane mechanical lock, it has no effect on magic locks. Applying lockslip grease to a lock is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
Nature's Draught											TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:50	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.119																																					SPROP:This substance is a murky, pungent liquid. When consumed, nature's draught causes subtle changes in the user's scent. Animals respond well to a character who has consumed nature's draught, finding her less threatening and easier to trust. Drinking a vial of nature's draught provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks made during the next 12 hours.
Softfoot												TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:50	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.119																																					SPROP:Softfoot is a fine gray powder that muffles sound when applied to the bottom of a foot or boot. It provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 hour. One dose of softfoot is enough to affect one Medium creature that has one pair of feet; each additional pair of feet (or similar appendages) requires another dose. Applying softfoot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If softfoot is applied over a boot or other foot covering, its benefit is lost if the foot covering is removed. Likewise, if it is applied to a creature's skin or hide, its benefit is lost if the creature later dons footwear.
Suregrip												TYPE:Alchemical Item						COST:20	WT:0		SOURCEPAGE:p.119																																					SPROP:This thick white paste, when applied to hands and feet, strengthens and steadies the user's grip, making it easier for the character to climb. Suregrip provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Climb checks for 1 minute. One dose of suregrip is enough to cover the hands and feet of one Medium creature. Applying suregrip is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Capsule Retainer											TYPE:Alchemical Item.Delivery Device			COST:100			SOURCEPAGE:p.120																																					SPROP:A capsule retainer consists of a thin, rubbery strap looped inside the teeth. The strap is fitted with a small, smooth metal ring that can hold one alchemical capsule. The ring can be positioned on either the inside or outside of the user's gums. Some users find that holding the ring inside the gum and keeping the capsule under the tongue is the most comfortable way to wear a capsule retainer, while others find that holding the ring on the outside of the upper gum allows them to tuck the capsule in their cheek comfortably.
Alchemical Tooth											TYPE:Alchemical Item.Delivery Device			COST:300			SOURCEPAGE:p.120																																					SPROP:Those relying on secrecy in the use of their alchemical capsules turn instead to the alchemical tooth. As its name suggests, this specially concealed item has been made to look like a tooth. The tooth functions in all respects like a capsule retainer (see above). In addition, it is very hard to find without a thorough search (Search DC 30). The false tooth is most often used as a concealed version of a capsule retainer, but a few extremely dedicated spies and other agents carry a tooth filled with poison as insurance against being captured alive. An alchemical tooth can hold one dose of any contact poison or ingested poison, but such poison can only affect the wearer of the tooth-there's no way to make the tooth an effective delivery mechanism when combined with a bite attack.
#
Antitoxin Capsule											TYPE:Alchemical Item.Capsule					COST:15			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:This capsule holds a dose of weak antitoxin. When imbibed, it provides a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws made against poison. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.
Ironman Capsule											TYPE:Alchemical Item.Capsule					COST:15			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:This capsule holds a thick pale liquid that allows the user to shake off pain and distraction. Anyone using an ironman capsule while staggered can ignore the restrictions on the number of actions taken in a round because of the staggered condition (rather than being limited to one standard action). This benefit applies only to the round in which the capsule is used, and the effect ends immediately after the user has taken his actions for the round. For example, a staggered character with a capsule retainer can use the capsule at the beginning of his turn (a swift action) and then take a move action and a standard action. An ironman capsule does not prevent a character from losing a hit point if he is already at or below 0 hit points and does not prevent the user from dying if he reaches -10 hit points.
Leap Capsule											TYPE:Alchemical Item.Capsule					COST:15			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:The thick gray liquid in this capsule allows the user to make more powerful jumps for a short time. The user gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Jump checks. The benefit of a leap capsule lasts for only 1 round, ending immediately upon the conclusion of the user's actions for the round.
Stability Capsule											TYPE:Alchemical Item.Capsule					COST:15			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:The thick blue liquid in this capsule heightens the user's sense of balance for a short time. While the capsule is in effect, the user gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Balance checks. The benefits of a stability capsule last for only 1 round, ending immediately upon the conclusion of the user's actions for the round.
Strongarm Capsule											TYPE:Alchemical Item.Capsule					COST:125			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:This small capsule holds a dose of a thin red liquid. When swallowed, the liquid provides a temporary boost of physical power at the cost of leaving the user fatigued. When used, a strongarm capsule provides the user with a +1 alchemical bonus on Strength checks and melee weapon damage. This benefit lasts for 2 rounds, at the end of which time the user becomes fatigued. If a character who uses a strongarm capsule is already fatigued when the benefit of the capsule ends, she becomes exhausted.
Swiftstride Capsule										TYPE:Alchemical Item.Capsule					COST:15			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:This small capsule holds a dose of a thin blue liquid. When swallowed, the liquid quickens the imbiber's stride for a short time, providing a temporary boost of speed at the cost of leaving the user fatigued. A swiftstride capsule increases the user's base land speed by 5 feet. This benefit lasts for 2 rounds, at the end of which time the user becomes fatigued. If a character who uses a swiftstride capsule is already fatigued when the benefit of the capsule ends, he becomes exhausted.
# Alcehmical Weapon Capsules
Weapon Capsule Retainer										TYPE:Alchemical Item.Weapon Capsule				COST:100			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:The most common method of delivering the effect of an alchemical weapon capsule is the weapon capsule retainer. This long leather thong, wrapped around a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (but not a projectile weapon) just at the base of the blade or striking surface, holds a thin, fitted ring sized for a single alchemical capsule. A more expensive option is the triple weapon capsule retainer, which stores three capsules rather than one. A character wielding a weapon with a triple retainer can use one, two, or all three capsules it holds as part of the same action. Only one weapon capsule retainer (or triple retainer) can be attached to any weapon. Attaching a weapon capsule retainer to a weapon or putting a capsule into an empty weapon capsule retainer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Thus, filling an empty triple weapon capsule retainer requires three full-round actions. An alchemical weapon capsule retainer can be filled with a single dose of an injury poison. Activating the capsule coats the weapon with the poison, allowing the wielder to deliver toxic strikes with the weapon. A character using poison in this way faces all the normal perils of using poison (including accidental exposure when activating the capsule or with a natural 1 on the attack roll).
Triple Weapon Capsule Retainer								TYPE:Alchemical Item.Weapon Capsule				COST:450			SOURCEPAGE:p.121																																					SPROP:The most common method of delivering the effect of an alchemical weapon capsule is the weapon capsule retainer. This long leather thong, wrapped around a melee weapon or a thrown weapon (but not a projectile weapon) just at the base of the blade or striking surface, holds a thin, fitted ring sized for a single alchemical capsule. A more expensive option is the triple weapon capsule retainer, which stores three capsules rather than one. A character wielding a weapon with a triple retainer can use one, two, or all three capsules it holds as part of the same action.

Attaching a weapon capsule retainer to a weapon or putting a capsule into an empty weapon capsule retainer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Thus, filling an empty triple weapon capsule retainer requires three full-round actions. An alchemical weapon capsule retainer can be filled with a single dose of an injury poison. Activating the capsule coats the weapon with the poison, allowing the wielder to deliver toxic strikes with the weapon. A character using poison in this way faces all the normal perils of using poison (including accidental exposure when activating the capsule or with a natural 1 on the attack roll).
Ghostblight												TYPE:Alchemical Item.Weapon Capsule				COST:100			SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:A ghostblight alchemical capsule coats a melee weapon or a thrown weapon with a thick gray liquid. This substance allows the weapon to ignore the miss chance that ordinarily applies when the wielder is in combat with incorporeal creatures (as if the weapon had the ghost touch magical property). The capsule's effects last for 3 rounds.
Quickflame												TYPE:Alchemical Item.Weapon Capsule				COST:25			SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:A quickflame alchemical capsule coats a melee weapon or a thrown weapon with a thin sheet of oil that instantly bursts into flame. This substance allows the weapon to deal extra fire damage for a short amount of time without damaging the weapon or its wielder. A weapon treated with quickflame deals 1d6 points of fire damage with each successful strike. The capsule's effects last for 1 round, ending at the beginning of the wielder's next turn. This fire damage doesn't stack with any other fire damage the weapon deals.
Quickfrost												TYPE:Alchemical Item.Weapon Capsule				COST:25			SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:A quickfrost alchemical capsule coats a melee weapon or a thrown weapon with a thin sheet of oil that instantly cools to a dangerously low temperature. This substance allows the weapon to deal extra cold damage for a short amount of time without damaging the weapon or its wielder. A weapon treated with quickfrost deals 1d6 points of cold damage with each successful strike. The capsule's effects last for 1 round, ending at the beginning of the wielder's next turn. This cold damage doesn't stack with any other cold damage the weapon deals.
Quickspark												TYPE:Alchemical Item.Weapon Capsule				COST:25			SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:A quickspark alchemical capsule coats a melee weapon or a thrown weapon with a thin sheet of liquid that crackles and sparks with dangerous electrical energy. This substance allows the weapon to deal extra electricity damage for a short amount of time without damaging the weapon or its wielder. A weapon treated with quickspark deals 1d6 points of electricity damage with each successful strike. The capsule's effects last for 1 round, ending at the beginning of the wielder's next turn. This electricity damage doesn't stack with any other electricity damage the weapon deals.
Quicksilver												TYPE:Alchemical Item.Weapon Capsule				COST:50			SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:A quicksilver alchemical capsule coats a melee weapon or a thrown weapon with a thick silvery liquid. This substance allows the weapon to deal damage as if it were coated with silver (including the normal -1 penalty on damage rolls for silvered weapons). The capsule's effects last for 3 rounds and override any other special material effects of the weapon.

# Tools and Skill Kits
Animal Training Kit										TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:75	WT:15		SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:This kit includes signal whistles, a short hollow pole with a loop of rope threaded through it, savory treats, and other well-made items suited for the training of animals. This kit grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks made for teaching animals tricks, training animals for a purpose, or rearing a wild animal. It does not grant a bonus for other uses of the Handle Animal skill.
Balance Pole											TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:5	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:This long, flexible pole is the perfect tool for balancing. The pole is 10 feet long, so it cannot be used in any space that allows less than 5 feet of clearance on either side. Provided the user has space to employ the pole properly, it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance checks.
Camouflage Kit											TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:40	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:This bag contains face paints, dye, colored cloth, and other accessories appropriate for creating a camouflaged appearance. The kit is the perfect tool for hiding and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Hide checks. Gaining this bonus requires 1 minute of work. A camouflage kit is exhausted after ten uses.
Forgery Kit												TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:40	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.122																																					SPROP:This small case holds a broad selection of paper types, pens, and several colors of ink. In addition, the kit contains samples of prominent family and national crests and the like. This kit is the perfect tool for attempting a forgery and grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Forgery checks. A forgery kit is exhausted after ten uses.
Listening Cone											TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:20	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.123																																					SPROP:This device is made for listening through doors and other solid surfaces. It provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Listen checks made through a door or some other relatively thin, solid obstacle.
Thieves' Tools, Longspoon		KEY:Thieves' Tools (Longspoon)		TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:80	WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.123																																					SPROP:These specially modified thieves' tools are mounted on long, thin handles, enabling the user to manipulate latches, tinker with locks, and probe traps from a position up to 5 feet away and well off to the side of the target device. A 1-inch-diameter mirror mounted on a long handle gives the user a good view of the object being manipulated. Though some traps can inflict harm even at a distance, these tools make it possible for a wary rogue to avoid many common hazards, such as poison needles, spurting acid, and the like. Using these tools is more time-consuming and less accurate than taking a direct approach; longspoon tools add 2 rounds to the time required to make a Disable Device or Open Lock check and impose a -2 penalty on any Disable Device or Open Lock check for which they are used. Longspoon thieves' tools are available in normal or masterwork versions. The masterwork version provides a +2 bonus on Disable Device and Open Lock checks, but the time required to make a check is not reduced.
Thieves' Tools, Longspoon		KEY:Thieves' Tools (Longspoon/Masterwork)	TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:80	WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.123																																					SPROP:These specially modified thieves' tools are mounted on long, thin handles, enabling the user to manipulate latches, tinker with locks, and probe traps from a position up to 5 feet away and well off to the side of the target device.

The masterwork version provides a +2 bonus on Disable Device and Open Lock checks, but the time required to make a check is not reduced.
Masterwork Riding Saddle		KEY:Saddle (Riding/Masterwork)		TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:180	WT:30		SOURCEPAGE:p.123																																					SPROP:This well-made piece of gear, which can be either a riding saddle or a military saddle, is more comfortable and more responsive than a normal saddle. Because of its excellent craftsmanship, a masterwork saddle grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Ride checks. If a masterwork saddle is also a military saddle, this bonus stacks with the +2 circumstance bonus that a military saddle provides to Ride checks relating to staying in the saddle (see Player's Handbook, page 132). Each masterwork saddle is tailored for a specific kind of creature. As such, it fits best on that kind of creature and thus provides its bonus only when used with that kind of creature. For example, a masterwork saddle made for heavy warhorses would provide its bonus if used on any heavy warhorse, but would not provide a bonus if used on a dragon (assuming the saddle was of an appropriate size for the dragon).
Masterwork Military Saddle		KEY:Saddle (Military/Masterwork)		TYPE:Tools and Skill Kits					COST:210	WT:40		SOURCEPAGE:p.123																																					SPROP:This well-made piece of gear, which can be either a riding saddle or a military saddle, is more comfortable and more responsive than a normal saddle. Because of its excellent craftsmanship, a masterwork saddle grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Ride checks. If a masterwork saddle is also a military saddle, this bonus stacks with the +2 circumstance bonus that a military saddle provides to Ride checks relating to staying in the saddle (see Player's Handbook, page 132). Each masterwork saddle is tailored for a specific kind of creature. As such, it fits best on that kind of creature and thus provides its bonus only when used with that kind of creature. For example, a masterwork saddle made for heavy warhorses would provide its bonus if used on any heavy warhorse, but would not provide a bonus if used on a dragon (assuming the saddle was of an appropriate size for the dragon).

Collar of Obedience			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:1500			SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:Any animal or magical beast wearing this collar becomes easier to handle. The DC of any Handle Animal check to handle, push, teach, train, or rear the wearer is decreased by 5. A collar occupies the same space on the body as an amulet, brooch, or other item meant to be worn around the neck.. Faint enchantment; CL 3rd
Crown of Steady Rulership		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:4500			SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:This ornate golden crown is a useful tool for princes and potentates, for it allows them to see through the falsehoods that parade before them. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks and on Spot checks made to see through disguises. Faint divination; CL 3rd
Flute of the Snake			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:15400			SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:The music of this flute has the power to charm snakes of all kinds. By playing this flute and making a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the musician can produce a charm animal effect that affects only snakes. This power can be used three times per day. Once per day, by playing a droning sequence of notes for 1 full round and succeeding on a DC 20 Perform (wind instruments) check, a musician can summon 1d4+1 Medium vipers. These snakes appear wherever the flutist designates within 30 feet of her location. They fight on the musician's behalf, attacking on her turn, and remain for 7 rounds or until killed. Moderate conjuration and enchantment; CL 7th
Harp of the Immortal Maestro		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:51000	WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:This pinnacle of instrument design functions as a masterwork harp with minor magical effects in the hands of someone with 1 or more ranks in Perform (string instruments). By speaking the correct command words, such a musician can use levitate and magic circle against evil once per day each. A harp of the immortal maestro functions best in the hands of a musician with at least 15 ranks in Perform (string instruments). Such a user can, simply by strumming the harp, generate the following effects once per day each: cure critical wounds, displacement, and summon monster V. Moderate abjuration, conjuration, illusion, and transmutation; CL 9th
Headband of Conscious Effort		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item.Helm			COST:4000			SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:Anyone wearing a headband of conscious effort can make a Concentration check in place of a required Fortitude saving throw. This ability can be activated once per day. Activating the headband is an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Moderate transmutation; CL 6th
Jumping Caltrops				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:150	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:These unusual items are actually Diminutive animated objects. When released from their bag, they begin hopping around the 5-foot square in which they land. When someone tries to move into, through, or within that square on foot, the jumping caltrops immediately try to scurry under the interloper's feet. Jumping caltrops can't move from the square in which they land. The number of caltrop attacks a creature is subject to while within the affected area depends on its current speed: four if it moved into the square at normal speed, two if it moved into the square at half speed, and none if it moved into the square at one-quarter speed or less. (One-quarter speed assumes that the creature is shuffling forward without picking up its feet.) The target's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses don't count against these attacks. A target that is wearing shoes or other footwear, however, gets a +2 bonus to AC. The speed of any target that takes damage from the caltrop attack is reduced to one-half normal because of the foot injury. Once they are released, jumping caltrops continue to move for 11 rounds, though the owner can order them back into the bag before the duration expires if desired. However, they can move (and thus attack on their own) only upon their first use; thereafter, they become normal caltrops. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th
Lute of the Wandering Minstrel	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:29500			SOURCEPAGE:p.133	SPROP:This finely wrought instrument functions as a masterwork lute with minor magical effects in the hands of someone with 1 or more ranks in Perform (string instruments). By speaking the correct command words, such a musician can use levitate and magic circle against evil once per day each. A musician with 5 or more ranks in Perform (string instruments) can coax additional magical effects from this instrument. By playing a single chord on the lute, such a performer can generate an expeditious retreat, haste, or phantom steed effect. Each of these abilities is usable once per day. Faint abjuration, conjuration, and transmutation; CL 5th;
Mandolin of the Inspiring Muse	TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:42000	WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Bards and other musicians prize this carefully crafted mandolin, which functions as a masterwork mandolin with minor magical effects in the hands of someone with 1 or more ranks in Perform (string instruments). By speaking the correct command words, such a musician can utilize levitate and magic circle against evil once per day each. In addition, an owner with at least 15 ranks in Perform (string instruments) can use the mandolin to generate the effects of crushing despair, dominate person, and good hope each once per day each by playing the correct notes. Moderate abjuration, enchantment, and transmutation; CL 9th
Mask of Lies				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:17000			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This black, featureless mask has only slits for eyes and mouth. The wearer can use disguise self on herself at will and is continually under the effect of undetectable alignment. In addition, she gains a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks. A mask occupies the same space on the body as eye lenses or goggles. Faint abjuration and illusion; CL 5th
Medal of Gallantry			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:1100			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This silver sun-shaped brooch grants its wearer a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks but imposes a -2 penalty on Bluff checks. This penalty remains for 24 hours after the medal is removed. Three times per day the wearer can use sanctuary on himself as a swift action. If the wearer attacks while protected by this effect, he takes a -1 morale penalty on that attack and all subsequent attacks for 1 hour afterward. Faint abjuration; CL 3rd
Monocle of Perusal			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:6500			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This crystal lens provides the user with a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks. Once per day the user can use identify. A monocle occupies the same space on the body as a pair of eye lenses or goggles. Faint divination; CL 3rd
Papyrus of Deception			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:2000			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This enchanted sheet of paper usually looks thick and yellowed with age. However, when used as the basis for a forged document, the papyrus is extremely useful, since it changes its size, consistency, and appearance to match the mental description of the forger. When used as part of a forgery, papyrus of deception adds a +5 enhancement bonus to the Forgery check. The papyrus can never duplicate a sheet of paper larger than 12 inches on a side or smaller than 3 inches on a side. Papyrus of deception can be reused. Faint divination; CL 5th
Pendant of Draconic Empathy		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item.Amulet		COST:3300			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:This enchanted amulet allows the wearer to use the Handle Animal skill in place of the Diplomacy skill when dealing with dragons whose Intelligence is 11 or lower. Moderate enchantment; CL 11th
Possum Pouch				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:1800			SOURCEPAGE:p.134	SPROP:Also known as a false stomach, a possum pouch is a small, flat, circular bag about 10 to 12 inches in diameter and up to 2 inches thick. When placed against a humanoid's abdomen and sealed there with a command word, it blends in unobtrusively with the surrounding skin, requiring a DC 30 Search check to detect. Spies and couriers find these items useful as diplomatic pouches, while nobles and wealthy merchants sometimes use them as money belts. Assassins, ninjas, and sneak-thieves love possum pouches because they make it easy to smuggle poison, daggers, and small valuables into or out of well-guarded houses. Faint illusion; CL 3rd
Rope of Stone				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:2800	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This normal-looking, 50-foot coil of silk rope becomes as hard as stone (hardness 8, 15 hp) when a command word is spoken. A second command word returns the rope to its normal composition. The rope retains its exact shape when hardened (which adds 5 to the DC of Escape Artist checks made to slip free of it). If it is ever broken in either form, the rope is destroyed. Faint transmutation; CL 5th
Sandals of Harmonious Balance		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item.Boot.Footwear	COST:14000			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:These plainlooking wood and leather sandals make it possible to undertake incredible feats of balance. While wearing sandals of harmonious balance, a character gains a +10 insight bonus on Balance checks and can balance on vertical surfaces. The normal DC modifiers (such as for a slippery surface) apply, except for the modifier for a sloped or angled surface. If balanced on a vertical surface, the wearer can move up or down as if she were climbing. However, she is not actually climbing, so she can make attacks normally, retains her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and generally follows the rules of the Balance skill rather than the Climb skill. If the wearer has 10 or more ranks in Balance, she can balance on liquids, semisolid surfaces such as mud or snow, or similar surfaces that normally couldn't support her weight. For each consecutive round that she begins balanced on a particular surface of this sort, the DC of her Balance check increases by 5. As with all uses of the Balance skill, the wearer moves at half speed unless she decides to use the accelerated movement option (thereby increasing the DC of the Balance check by 5). For more information on the Balance skill, see page 67 of the Player's Handbook. Moderate transmutation; CL 8th
Scarf of Warmth				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item.Amulet		COST:250			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:This woolen scarf provides the wearer with a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of cold weather (see Cold Dangers, page 302 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). A scarf occupies the same space on the body as an amulet, necklace, or other item worn around the neck. Faint abjuration; CL 3rd
Shawl of Bewitching			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:3500			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:A character wearing this simple-looking shawl gains a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks made to conceal the truth (but not on any other use of the Bluff skill, including feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or delivering a secret message). It also adds 1 to the wearer's caster level when he casts any enchantment (charm) spell. A shawl occupies the same space on the body as a cloak, cape, or mantle. Faint enchantment; CL 3rd
Spellsight Spectacles			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:2500			SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:These spectacles grant the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Spellcraft checks made to decipher scrolls, and a +5 competence bonus on Use Magic Device checks made to use scrolls. Spectacles occupy the same space on the body as a pair of eye lenses or goggles. Faint divination; CL 3rd
Spool of Endless Rope			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:2000	WT:1		SOURCEPAGE:p.135	SPROP:Some adventurers never seem to have enough rope. A spool of endless rope contains an unlimited amount of the finest silk rope, yet the whole spool weighs only a single pound. The spool comes with a belt loop so that it can be hung conveniently at an adventurer's side. To use a spool of endless rope, the owner feeds out as little or as much rope as desired, up to a maximum of 500 feet at any one time. When finished with the rope, the owner can simply wind it back onto the spool. (Feeding out or rewinding requires 1 round per 50 feet of rope.) The rope can't be entirely separated from the spool, though it can be cut or broken as a normal silk rope can be. Any portion of rope cut away from the spool disappears instantly, but the spool immediately replenishes the missing rope. The rope from a spool of endless rope can be spliced or knotted together with another rope (including a rope from a second spool of endless rope), but the rope can't be wound back into the spool while so attached. Moderate conjuration; CL 9th
Strings of Spell Storing		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:45000			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This set of catgut strings for a lute, mandolin, or other string instrument can store up to five levels of spells. By making a DC 15 Perform (string instruments) check while employing a masterwork instrument equipped with these strings, a musician can unleash the desired spell. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast the spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus, or pay an XP cost to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for any armor the user is wearing. The activation time for the strings is the same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action. Treat a randomly generated set of strings of spell storing as a scroll for determining what spells are stored within it (see pages 238-243 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If you roll a spell that would put the set over its five-level limit, ignore that roll; those strings have no more spells in them. (Not every newly discovered set of strings is fully charged.) The strings magically impart to the user the names of all spells currently stored within them. Casting spells into the strings functions identically to casting spells into a ring of spell storing (see page 233 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), except that the caster must have at least 1 rank of Perform (string instruments) and must make a successful Perform (string instruments) check (DC 10 + spell level). Failure causes the spell to be lost to no effect. Moderate evocation; CL 9th
Stylus of the Masterful Hand		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:3000			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This elegant but sturdy metal stylus grants a +5 competence bonus on Forgery checks. On command, a stylus of the masterful hand can also remember up to three different types of handwriting, which allows a later attempt to create a forgery of a document without requiring the forger to have a sample of the handwriting (see Forgery, page 74 of the Player's Handbook). The DC to reproduce that handwriting is fixed at whatever check result was achieved during the attempt in which the sample was collected. A second command word allows the user to erase a sample of handwriting stored in a stylus. Faint divination; CL 3rd
Trumpeter's Gift				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:12700			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This shiny mouthpiece fits any wind instrument, such as a trumpet or other horn. It grants a +5 competence bonus on Perform (wind instruments) checks using the instrument. Once per day, the trumpeter can use the horn to produce a shout effect. If the horn is not of masterwork quality, however, it is destroyed once this effect is produced. Moderate evocation; CL 7th
Tunic of Steady Spellcasting		TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:2500			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:The wearer of this tunic gains a +5 competence bonus on Concentration checks. Despite the item's name, its bonus applies on all Concentration checks, not just those made to cast spells. Faint transmutation; CL 3rd
Vial of the Last Gasp			TYPE:Magic.Wondrous Item			COST:2200			SOURCEPAGE:p.136	SPROP:This is actually the necromantically preserved last breath of some famous figure, trapped in a vial. A vial of the last gasp allow the user to draw strength and knowledge from the dead creature. Anyone who unstoppers the vial and inhales its vapors (the equivalent of drinking a potion) gains 1d8 temporary hit points, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and a +4 insight bonus on checks using one Craft, Knowledge, or Profession skill possessed by the deceased. (However, the vapors in a vial of the last gasp do not allow an untrained user to make use of a trained-only skill.) The creator specifies the skill to which the bonus applies upon creating the item; it is usually the skill in which the deceased has the greatest number of ranks. In addition, the fumes increase the user's effective caster level by 1. These effects last for 10 minutes. Faint necromancy; CL 4th
