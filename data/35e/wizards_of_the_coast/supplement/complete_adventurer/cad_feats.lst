Appraise Magic Value		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:3,Appraise=5,Knowledge (Arcana)=5,Spellcraft=5																								DESC:Your ability to determine an item's worth and your knowledge of magic allow you to determine the exact properties of a magic item without the use of the identify spell or similar magic.																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.103	BENEFIT:If you know that an item is magical, you can use the Appraise skill to identify the item's properties. This use of the Appraise skill requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work and consumes 25 gp worth of special materials. The DC of the Appraise check is 10 + the caster level of the item.
Ascetic Hunter			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Favored Enemy														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike																																						DESC:You have gone beyond the bounds of your monastic training to incorporate new modes of bringing the unlawful to justice. Although many of your fellow monks frown on your methods, none can doubt that your diverse training has added to your ability to strike precisely and bring down your foes quickly.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.105	BENEFIT:When you use an unarmed strike to deliver a stunning attack against a favored enemy, you can add one-half your favored enemy bonus on damage rolls to the DC of your stunning attempt. If you have levels in ranger and monk, those levels stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage. For example, a human 7th-level ranger/1stlevel monk would deal 1d10 points of damage with her unarmed strike. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the monk and ranger classes. You must still remain lawful in order to retain your monk abilities and take monk levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
Ascetic Knight			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Improved Unarmed Strike, ability to smite evil.											DESC:You belong to a special order of religious monks that teaches its adherents that self-enlightenment and honorable service grow from the same well of purity. As a student of this philosophy, you have blended your training as a paladin and as a monk into one seamless whole.																										SOURCEPAGE:p.105	BENEFIT:Your paladin and monk levels stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage. For example, a human 3rd-level paladin/1st-level monk would deal 1d8 points of damage with her unarmed strike. Your paladin and monk levels also stack when determining the extra damage dealt by your smite evil ability. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and monk classes. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels, and you must remain lawful in order to continue advancing as a monk. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
Ascetic Mage			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Improved Unarmed Strike, ability to spontaneously cast 2nd-level arcane spells.						DESC:You practice an unusual martial art that mixes self-taught spellcasting and melee attacks to great effect.																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.105	BENEFIT:As a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, you can sacrifice one of your daily allotment of spells to add a bonus to your unarmed strike attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. The bonus is equal to the level of the spell sacrificed. The spell is lost as if you had cast it. If you have levels in sorcerer and monk, those levels stack for the purpose of determining your AC bonus. For example, a human 4th-level sorcerer/1st-level monk would have a +1 bonus to AC as if she were a 5th-level monk. If you would normally be allowed to add your Wisdom bonus to AC (such as for a unarmored, unencumbered monk), you instead add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your AC. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the sorcerer and monk classes. You must still remain lawful in order to continue advancing as a monk. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
Ascetic Rogue			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Unarmed Strike															PRETEXT:Improved Unarmed Strike, sneak attack.								PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttackDice,1	DESC:You have gone beyond the bounds of your monastic training to incorporate new modes of stealthy combat. Although your fellow monks may frown on your methods, none can doubt that your diverse training has improved your ability to strike precisely and bring down your foes quickly.																									SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:When you use an unarmed strike with a sneak attack to deliver a stunning attack, you add 2 to the DC of your stunning attempt. If you have levels in rogue and monk, those levels stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage. For example, a human 5th-level rogue/1st-level monk would deal 1d8 points of damage with her unarmed strike. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the monk and rogue classes. You must still remain lawful in order to retain your monk abilities and take monk levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
Brachiation				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:2,Climb=4,Jump=4									PRETEXT:Climb 4 ranks, Jump 4 ranks.														DESC:You can swing through trees like a monkey.																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:You can move through wooded areas at your base land speed, ignoring any effects on movement due to terrain. You must be at least 20 feet from the ground to use this ability. This ability works only in medium and dense forests (see page 87 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
Brutal Throw			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Fighter																																																																			DESC:You have learned how to hurl weapons to deadly effect.																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:You can add your Strength modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) to attack rolls with thrown weapons. Normal: A character attacking with a ranged weapon adds his Dexterity modifier to the attack roll. Special: A fighter may select Brutal Throw as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Combat Intuition			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Fighter																																		PRESKILL:1,Sense Motive=4									PRETEXT:Sense Motive 4 ranks, base attack bonus +5.												DESC:Your keen understanding of your opponent's moves and your instinctive feel for the flow of combat enable you to shrewdly assess your opponent's combat capabilities.																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:As a free action, you can use Sense Motive to assess the challenge presented by a single opponent in relationship to your own level/Hit Dice (see the assess opponent option under the Sense Motive skill, page 102). You gain a +4 bonus on such checks and narrow the result to a single category. In addition, whenever you make a melee attack against a creature that you made a melee attack against during the previous round, you gain a +1 insight bonus on your melee attack rolls against that creature. Special: A fighter may select Combat Intuition as one of his fighter bonus feats.																																																																																																	PRETOTALAB:5
Danger Sense			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Initiative																PRETEXT:Improved Initiative.																DESC:You are one twitchy individual.																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:Once per day, you can reroll an initiative check you have just made. You use the better of your two rolls. You must decide to reroll before the round starts.
Death Blow				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Initiative																PRETEXT:Improved Initiative, base attack bonus +2.												DESC:You waste no time in dealing with downed foes.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:You can perform a coup de grace attack against a helpless defender as a standard action. Doing this still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

PRETOTALAB:2
Deft Opportunist			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes													PRESTAT:1,DEX=15	PRETEXT:Dex 15, Combat Reflexes.															DESC:You are prepared for the unexpected.																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:You get a +4 bonus on attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity.
Deft Strike				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes						PRESKILL:1,Spot=10				PRESTAT:1,INT=15	PRETEXT:Int 13, Combat Expertise, Spot 10 ranks, sneak attack.					PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttackDice,1	DESC:You can place attacks at weak points in your opponent's defenses.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.106	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can attempt to find a weak point in a visible target's armor. This requires a Spot check against a DC equal to your target's Armor Class. If you succeed, your next attack against that target (which must be made no later than your next turn) ignores the target's armor bonus and natural armor bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor). Other AC bonuses still apply normally. If you use a ranged weapon to deliver the attack, your opponent must be within 30 feet of you in order for you to benefit from this feat.
Devoted Inquisitor		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Smite Evil																																						PRETEXT:Smite evil, sneak attack.										PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttackDice,1	DESC:Your faithful service to your patron deity involves training and methods that many paladins consider questionable. By using the unconventional methods of rogues and assassins, you have learned to deliver devastating sneak attacks against evil foes.																														SOURCEPAGE:p.107	BENEFIT:When you successfully use your sneak attack ability and your smite evil ability against the same foe in a single attack, you can potentially daze your foe. An opponent affected by both abilities must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and rogue classes. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
Devoted Performer			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Smite Evil	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music																												PRETEXT:Bardic music, smite evil.															DESC:You have foregone the pursuit of frivolous musical talents, instead entering religious training in service of honor and justice.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.107	BENEFIT:If you have levels in paladin and bard, those levels stack for the purpose of determining the bonus damage dealt by your smite evil ability and determining the number of times per day that you can use your bardic music. This feat does not allow additional daily uses of smite evil or bardic music abilities beyond what your class levels would normally allow. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and bard classes and may even gain additional bard levels regardless of your lawful alignment. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
Devoted Tracker			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Smite Evil	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Wild Empathy					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Track																		PRETEXT:Track, smite evil, wild empathy.														DESC:You have found a balance between your woodland training and your devotion to religious training, blending these two aspects into one seamless whole.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.108	BENEFIT:If you have levels in paladin and ranger, those levels stack for the purposes of determining the extra damage dealt by your smite evil ability and determining the bonus for your wild empathy class feature. This feat does not allow additional daily uses of smite evil. If you have both the special mount and animal companion class features, you can designate your special mount as your animal companion. The mount gains all the benefits of being both your special mount and your animal companion. For instance, a 5th-level paladin/6th-level ranger's special mount would have 4 bonus Hit Dice, a +6 natural armor adjustment, +2 Strength, +1 Dexterity, two bonus tricks, and Intelligence 6, as well as the empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, share saving throws, and link special abilities. In addition, you can multiclass freely between the paladin and ranger classes. You must still remain lawful good in order to retain your paladin abilities and take paladin levels. You still face the normal XP penalties for having multiple classes more than one level apart.
Disguise Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music																								PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=9									PRETEXT:Perform (any) 9 ranks, bardic music.													DESC:You can cast spells without observers noticing.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.108	BENEFIT:You can cast spells unobtrusively, mingling verbal and somatic components into your performances. To disguise a spell, make a Perform check as part of the action used to cast the spell. Onlookers must match or exceed your check result with a Spot check to detect that you're casting a spell (your performance is obvious to everyone in the vicinity, but the fact that you are casting a spell isn't). Unless the spell visibly emanates from you, or observers have some other means of determining its source, they don't know where the effect came from. A disguised spell can't be identified with a Spellcraft check, even by someone who realizes you're casting a spell. The act of casting still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
Dive For Cover			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																					PRECHECKBASE:1,Reflex=4																								PRETEXT:Base Reflex save bonus +4.															DESC:You can dive behind cover or drop to the ground quickly enough to avoid many area effects.																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.108	BENEFIT:If you fail a Reflex saving throw, you can immediately attempt the saving throw again. You must take the second result, whether it succeeds or fails. You become prone immediately after attempting the second roll.
Dual Strike				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Two-Weapon Fighting,Two-Weapon Fighting											PRETEXT:Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two- Weapon Fighting.											DESC:You are an expert skirmisher skilled at fighting with two weapons. Your extensive training with two weapons allows you to attack with both while moving through a chaotic combat or fighting a running battle.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.108	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can make a melee attack with your primary weapon and your off-hand weapon. Both attacks use the same attack roll to determine success, using the worse of the two weapons' attack modifiers. If you are using a one-handed or light weapon in your primary hand and a light weapon in your off hand, you take a -4 penalty on this attack roll; otherwise you take a -10 penalty. Each weapon deals its normal damage. Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each weapon attack. Special: When you make this attack, you apply precision- based damage (such as from sneak attack) only once. If you score a critical hit, only the weapon in your primary hand deals extra critical hit damage; your offhand weapon deals regular damage. A fighter may select Dual Strike as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Expert Tactician			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes													PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PRETEXT:Dex 13, Combat Reflexes, base attack bonus +2.											DESC:Your tactical skills work to your advantage.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.109	BENEFIT:If you hit a creature with an attack of opportunity, you and all your allies gain a +2 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls against that creature for 1 round.

Extraordinary Concentration	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:1,Concentration=15									PRETEXT:Concentration 15 ranks.															DESC:Your mind is so focused that you can cast spells even while concentrating on another spell.																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.109	BENEFIT:When concentrating to maintain a spell, you can make a Concentration check (DC 25 + spell level) to maintain concentration with just a move action. If you beat the DC by 10 or more, you can maintain concentration on the spell as a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137). Using this ability is a free action, but if you fail the Concentration check, you lose concentration on the maintained spell and its effect ends. This feat does not give you the ability to maintain concentration on more than one spell at a time. Normal: Concentrating on a spell is a standard action.
Extraordinary Spell Aim		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:1,Spellcraft=15									PRETEXT:Spellcraft 15 ranks.																DESC:You can shape a spell's area to exclude one creature from its effects.																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.109	BENEFIT:Whenever you cast a spell with an area, you can attempt to shape the spell's area so that one creature within the area is unaffected by the spell. To accomplish this, you must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level). Casting a spell affected by the Extraordinary Spell Aim feat requires a full-round action unless the spell's normal casting time is longer, in which case the casting time is unchanged.
Force of Personality		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																													PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	PRETEXT:Cha 13.																		DESC:You have cultivated an unshakable belief in your selfworth. Your sense of self and purpose are so strong that they bolster your willpower.

ASPECT:SaveBonus|add your Charisma modifier (instead of your Wisdom modifier) to Will saves against mind-affecting spells and abilities.
Goad					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																													PRESTAT:1,CHA=13	PRETEXT:Cha 13, base attack bonus +1.														DESC:You are skilled at inducing opponents to attack you.																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.109	BENEFIT:As a move action, you can goad an opponent that threatens you, has line of sight to you, can hear you, and has an Intelligence of 3 or higher. (The goad is a mind-affecting ability.) When the goaded opponent starts its next turn, if it threatens you and has line of sight to you, it must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier). If the opponent fails its save, you are the only creature it can make melee attacks against during this turn. (If it kills you, knocks you unconscious, loses sight of you, or otherwise is unable to make melee attacks against you, it may make any remaining melee attacks against other foes, as normal.) A goaded creature can still cast spells, make ranged attacks, move, or perform other actions normally. The use of this feat restricts only melee attacks. Special: A fighter may select Goad as one of his fighter bonus feats.																																													PRETOTALAB:1
Green Ear				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music																								PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=10									PRETEXT:Perform (any) 10 ranks, bardic music.													DESC:Your bardic music can affect plant creatures.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You can alter any of your mind-affecting bardic music abilities (or similar Perform-based abilities from other classes) so that they influence only plant creatures instead of other creatures. However, plants receive a +5 bonus on Will saves against any of these effects. Normal: Plants are normally immune to all mindaffecting spells and abilities.
Hear The Unseen			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Blind-Fight							PRESKILL:1,Listen=5							PRETEXT:Listen 5 ranks, Blind-Fight.														DESC:Your sense of hearing is so acute that you can partially pinpoint an opponent's location by sound, allowing you to strike even if the opponent is concealed or displaced.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:As a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can attempt a DC 25 Listen check. If successful, you can pinpoint the location of all foes within 30 feet, as long as you have line of effect to them. This benefit does not eliminate the normal miss chance for fighting foes with concealment, but it ensures that you can target the correct square with your attacks. If you are deafened or within an area of silence, you can't use this feat. If an invisible or hidden opponent is attempting to move silently, your Listen check is opposed by your opponent's Move Silently check, but your opponent gains a +15 bonus on this check. This feat does not work against perfectly silent opponents, such as incorporeal creatures.
Improved Diversion		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Fighter																																		PRESKILL:1,Bluff=4										PRETEXT:Bluff 4 ranks.																	DESC:You can create a diversion to hide quickly and with less effort.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You can use Bluff to create a diversion to hide (see page 68 of the Player's Handbook) as a move action. You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff checks made for this purpose. Normal: Without this feat, creating a diversion to hide using the Bluff skill requires a standard action. Special: A fighter may select Improved Diversion as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Improved Flight			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Ability to fly (naturally, magically, or through shapechanging).								DESC:You gain greater maneuverability when flying than you would normally have.

Improved Swimming			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:1,Swim=6											PRETEXT:Swim 6 ranks.																	DESC:You can swim faster than you normally could.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You can swim half your speed as a move action or your speed as a full-round action. Normal: You swim at one-quarter your speed as a move action or at half your speed as a full-round action.
Insightful Reflexes		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																				DESC:Your keen intellect allows you an uncanny knack for evading dangerous effects.																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You add your Intelligence modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) to Reflex saves.
Jack Of All Trades		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																													PRESTAT:1,INT=13	PRETEXT:Int 13.																		DESC:You have picked up a smattering of even the most obscure skills.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You can use any skill as if you had 1/2 rank in that skill. This benefit allows you to attempt checks with skills that normally don't allow untrained skill checks (such as Decipher Script and Knowledge). If a skill doesn't allow skill checks (such as Speak Language), this feat has no effect. Normal: Without this feat, you can't attempt some skill checks (Decipher Script, Disable Device, Handle Animal, Knowledge, Open Lock, Profession, Sleight of Hand, Speak Language, Spellcraft, Tumble, and Use Magic Device) unless you have ranks in the skill.
Leap Attack				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack							PRESKILL:1,Jump=8								PRETEXT:Jump 8 ranks, Power Attack.															DESC:You can combine a powerful charge and a mighty leap into one devastating attack.																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.110	BENEFIT:You can combine a jump with a charge against an opponent.If you cover at least 10 feet of horizontal distance with your jump, and you end your jump in a square from which you threaten your target, you deal +100%% the normal bonus damage from your use of the Power Attack feat. If you use this tactic with a two-handed weapon, you instead triple the extra damage from Power Attack. This attack must follow all the normal rules for using the Jump skill and for making a charge, except that you ignore rough terrain in any squares you jump over.
Lingering Song			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music																																					PRETEXT:Bardic music.																	DESC:Your inspirational bardic music stays with the listeners long after the last note has died away.																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.111	BENEFIT:If you use bardic music to inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics, the effect lasts for 1 minute after an inspired ally stops hearing you play. Normal: Inspire courage, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics last as long as an ally hears the bard sing plus an additional 5 rounds thereafter.
Mobile Spellcasting		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:1,Concentration=8									PRETEXT:Concentration 8 ranks.															DESC:Your focused concentration allows you to move while casting a spell.																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.111	BENEFIT:You can make a special Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) when casting a spell. If the check succeeds, you can cast the spell and move up to your speed as a single standard action. (You can't use this ability to cast a spell that takes longer than 1 standard action to cast.) If the check fails, you lose the spell and fail to cast it, just as if you had failed a Concentration check to cast the spell defensively. You still provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells from any creatures who threaten you at any point of your movement. You can cast defensively while using this feat, but doing so increases the Concentration DC to 25 + spell level.
Natural Bond			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Animal Companion																																					PRETEXT:Animal companion.																DESC:Your bond with your animal companion is exceptionally strong.																																	DEFINE:NonAnimalCompanionLevels|0	BONUS:VAR|NonAnimalCompanionLevels|TL-DruidLVL-(RangerLVL/2)	BONUS:VAR|AnimalCompanionLVL|min(NonAnimalCompanionLevels,3)	SOURCEPAGE:p.111	BENEFIT:Add three to your effective druid level for the purpose of determining the bonus Hit Dice, extra tricks, special abilities, and other bonuses that your animal companion receives (see page 36 of the Player's Handbook).

Obscure Lore			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Knowledge,TYPE.Lore																																			PRETEXT:Bardic knowledge or lore class feature.													DESC:You are a treasure trove of little-known information.

DESC:You have learned how to hurl weapons to deadly effect.																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.111	BENEFIT:On your turn, before making any attack rolls, you can choose to subtract a number from all thrown weapon attack rolls and add the same number to all thrown weapon damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attack rolls and the bonus on damage rolls applies until your next turn. Special: A fighter may select Power Throw as one of his fighter bonus feats.
Quick Reconnoiter			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:2,Listen=5,Spot=5									PRETEXT:Listen 5 ranks, Spot 5 ranks.														DESC:You can learn a lot of information from just a quick scan of an area or object.																																					BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|2																	SOURCEPAGE:p.112	BENEFIT:You can make one Spot check and one Listen check each round as a free action. You also gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Normal: Using Spot or Listen in a reactive fashion is a free action, but actively trying to make a Spot check or Listen check requires a move action.
Razing Strike			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Sneak attack, caster level 5th.									PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttackDice,1	DESC:You have mastered the art of delivering precise strikes against nonliving creatures while channeling spell energy through your melee attacks.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.112	BENEFIT:To activate this feat, you must sacrifice one of your daily allotment of spells (minimum spell level 1st). Doing this is a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. In exchange, you gain an insight bonus on your melee attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. The bonus on attack rolls equals the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus on damage rolls is 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed, plus any extra damage based on your sneak attack ability. These bonuses apply against only one type of creature, depending on the type of spell sacrificed. If you sacrifice an arcane spell, they apply against constructs; if the sacrificed spell is divine, the bonuses apply against undead. Example: A 5th-level wizard/1st-level rogue activates this feat, sacrificing a prepared web spell. She gains a +2 insight bonus on her melee attack rolls against constructs for 1 round, and also adds 3d6 points of damage to successful attacks against constructs during that round (2d6 for the 2nd-level spell, plus 1d6 for her sneak attack damage). This feat does not allow you to deliver critical hits or sneak attacks against constructs or undead.
Staggering Strike			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																PRETEXT:Base attack bonus +6, sneak attack.								PREVARGTEQ:SneakAttackDice,1	DESC:You can deliver a wound that hampers an opponent's movement.																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.112	BENEFIT:If you deal damage with a melee sneak attack, you can also deliver a wound that limits your foe's mobility. For 1 round (or until the target is the beneficiary of a DC 15 Heal check or any magical healing that restores at least 1 hit point, whichever comes first), your target is treated as if it were staggered, even if its nonlethal damage doesn't exactly equal its current hit points. A target can resist this effect by making a successful Fortitude save (DC equal to damage dealt). Multiple staggering strikes on the same creature do not stack. This feat has no effect on creatures not subject to sneak attack damage.																																																																																											PRETOTALAB:6
Subsonics				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music																																					PRETEXT:Perform (any) 10 ranks, bardic music.													DESC:Your music can affect even those who do not consciously hear it.																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.112	BENEFIT:You can produce music or poetics so subtly that opponents do not notice it, yet your allies still gain all the usual benefits from your bardic music. Similarly, you can affect opponents within range with your music, but unless they can see you performing or have some other means of discovering it, they cannot determine the source of the effect.
Tactile Trapsmith			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																				DESC:You can rely on your rapid reflexes and nimble fingers instead of your intellect when searching a room or when disabling a trap.

Versatile Performer		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																			PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=5									PRETEXT:Perform (any) 5 ranks.															DESC:You are skilled at many kinds of performances.																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.112	BENEFIT:Pick a number of Perform categories equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). For the purpose of making Perform checks, you are treated as having a number of ranks in those skills equal to the highest number of ranks you have in any Perform category. You cannot change these categories once you have picked them, but your score in them automatically increases if you later add additional ranks in your highest ranked Perform category. You gain new categories of your choice if your Intelligence bonus permanently increases. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on a combined Perform check when using two or more forms of performance at the same time, such as a bard strumming a lyre while singing. In such cases, add the bonus to the higher of your two Perform skill modifiers.		DEFINE:VersatilePerformerRanks|0	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Versatile Performer|max(1,INT)

DESC:You can channel the power of your bardic music to sustain your allies, allowing them to function even after receiving wounds that would cause others to falter.	SOURCEPAGE:p.113	BENEFIT:You can expend one daily use of your bardic music ability as an immediate action to provide all allies (including yourself) the benefit of the Diehard feat (see page 93 of the Player's Handbook) until the end of your next turn. You can use this feat multiple times consecutively to keep yourself and your allies conscious. Even while this feat is active, you or your allies die if reduced to -10 hit points or lower. This feat does not function in an area of magical silence.
Ironskin Chant		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Music	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music	PRESKILL:1,Concentration=12	PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=12	PRETEXT:Bardic music, Concentration 12 ranks, Perform 12 ranks.						DESC:You can channel the power of your bardic music to enable yourself to ignore minor injuries.												SOURCEPAGE:p.113	BENEFIT:As a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can expend one daily use of your bardic music ability to provide damage reduction of 5/- to yourself or to one ally within 30 feet who can hear you until the start of your next turn. This feat does not function in an area of magical silence.
Lyric Spell			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Bardic Music	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Bardic Music	PRESKILL:1,TYPE.Perform=9						PRETEXT:Bardic music, Perform 9 ranks, ability to spontaneously cast 2nd-level arcane spells.	DESC:You can channel the power of your bardic music into your magic, allowing you to expend uses of your bardic music ability to cast spells.					SOURCEPAGE:p.113	BENEFIT:You can expend daily uses of your bardic music to cast any arcane spell that you know and can cast spontaneously. You must still use an action to cast the spell (following the normal rules for casting time), but using the Lyric Spell feat counts as part of the spellcasting action. Casting a spell requires one use of your bardic music ability, plus one additional use per level of the spell. For example, casting a 3rd-level spell requires four daily uses of your bardic music ability. Special: Any spell that you cast using the Lyric Spell feat gains your instrument as an additional arcane focus, if you use one. You cannot use Lyric Spell to cast a spell improved by the Silent Spell metamagic feat.
