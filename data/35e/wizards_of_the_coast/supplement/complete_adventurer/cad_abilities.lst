AC Bonus				KEY:Ninja ~ AC Bonus				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:NinjaACBonus|0		DESC:A ninja is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, a ninja adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her Armor Class. This ability does not stack with the monk's AC bonus ability (a ninja with levels of monk does not add the bonus twice). In addition, a ninja gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five ninja levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when a ninja is flat-footed. The character loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

Ki Power				KEY:Ninja ~ Ki Power				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A ninja can channel her ki to manifest special powers of stealth and mobility. She can use her ki powers a number of times per day equal to one-half her class level (minimum 1) plus her Wisdom bonus (if any). Ki powers can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is unencumbered. As long as a ninja's ki pool isn't empty (that is, as long as she has at least one daily use remaining), she gains a +2 bonus on her Will saves. A ninja's ki powers are ghost step, ki dodge, ghost strike, greater ki dodge, and ghost walk. Each power is described under a separate entry below.

Sudden Strike			KEY:Ninja ~ Sudden Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DEFINE:SuddenStrikeDice|0	DESC:If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever a ninja's target is denied a Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the ninja deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with her attack. This extra damage increases by 1d6 points for every two ninja levels thereafter. A ninja can't use sudden strike when flanking an opponent unless that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sudden strikes. A ninja can't make a sudden strike while striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are out of reach. A ninja can't use sudden strike to deliver nonlethal damage. Weapons capable of dealing only nonlethal damage don't deal extra damage when used as part of a sudden strike. The extra damage from the sudden strike ability stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target.

Using this ability is a swift action (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 10th level, a ninja can become ethereal when using ghost step instead of becoming invisible.

Great Leap				KEY:Ninja ~ Great Leap				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 4th level and higher, a ninja always makes Jump checks as if she were running and had the Run feat, enabling her to make long jumps without a running start and granting a +4 bonus on the jump (see the skill description, page 77 of the Player's Handbook). This ability can be used only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.

Ki Dodge				KEY:Ninja ~ Ki Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 6th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to cause an attack against her to miss when it might otherwise hit. When a ninja activates this ability, her outline shifts and wavers, granting her concealment (20%% miss chance) against all attacks for 1 round. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. See invisibility has no effect on concealment granted by the ki dodge ability, but true seeing negates the miss chance. This concealment does not stack with that caused by other effects that grant concealment or by spells such as blink or displacement.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.8
Speed Climb				KEY:Ninja ~ Speed Climb				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A ninja of 7th level or higher can scramble up or down walls and slopes with great speed. She can climb at her speed as a move action with no penalty; however, she must begin and end the round on a horizontal surface (such as the ground or a rooftop). If she does not end her movement on a horizontal surface, she falls, taking falling damage as appropriate for her distance above the ground. A ninja needs only one free hand to use this ability. This ability can be used only if a ninja is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Ghost Strike			KEY:Ninja ~ Ghost Strike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 8th level and higher, a ninja can spend one daily use of her ki power to strike incorporeal and ethereal creatures as if they were corporeal. She also can use this ability to strike foes on the Material Plane normally while ethereal (for example, while using her ghost step ability). Activating the ghost strike ability is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It affects the next attack made by the ninja, as long as that attack is made before the end of her next turn.																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Improved Poison Use		KEY:Ninja ~ Improved Poison Use		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:Starting at 9th level, a ninja can apply poison to a weapon as a move action.

Evasion				KEY:Ninja ~ Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Evasion							DESC:Beginning at 12th level, a ninja can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save. (See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player's Handbook.) A ninja's use of evasion differs slightly from a monk's use in that a ninja can use evasion only if she is wearing no armor and is carrying no more than a light load.																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Ghost Mind				KEY:Ninja ~ Ghost Mind				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 14th level, a ninja gains a special resistance to spells of the scrying subschool. To detect or see a ninja with such a spell, the caster must make a caster level check (DC 20 + the ninja's class level). In the case of scrying spells (such as arcane eye) that scan the ninja's area, a failed check indicates that the spell works but the ninja simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts targeted specifically at the ninja do not work at all if the check fails.																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Ghost Sight				KEY:Ninja ~ Ghost Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Ninja Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:At 16th level and higher, a ninja can see invisible and ethereal creatures as easily as she sees material creatures and objects.

She deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet away from where she was at the start of her turn. The extra damage applies only to attacks made after the scout has moved at least 10 feet. The skirmish ability cannot be used while mounted. The extra damage applies only to attacks taken during the scout's turn. This extra damage increases by 1d6 for every four levels gained above 1st (2d6 at 5th, 3d6 at 9th, 4d6 at 13th, and 5d6 at 17th level). The extra damage only applies against living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The scout must be able to see the target well eough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Scouts can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet. At 3rd level, a scout gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves by 1 for every four levels gained above 3rd (+2 at 7th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 15th, and +5 at 19th level). A scout loses this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. If she gains the skirmish ability from another class, the bonuses stack.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Spellthief ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:Spellthieves are proficient with all simple weapons and with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for spellthief spells are simple, a spellthief can cast spellthief spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, a spellthief wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (see page 123 of the Player's Handbook) if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass spellthief still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes, including those stolen from arcane casters (see the steal spell ability, below).

Steal Spell				KEY:Spellthief ~ Steal Spell				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DEFINE:StealSpellLevel|0	DEFINE:AbsorbSpellTier|0	DESC:A spellthief can siphon spell energy away from his target and use it himself. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead steal a spell, or the potential to cast a specific known spell, from his target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell with a touch as a standard action. The target of a steal spell attack loses one 0-level or 1st-level spell from memory if she prepares spells ahead of time, or one 0-level or 1st-level spell slot if she is a spontaneous caster. A spontaneous caster also loses the ability to cast the stolen spell for 1 minute. If the target has no spells prepared (or has no remaining spell slots, if she is a spontaneous caster), this ability has no effect. A spellthief can choose which spell to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen spell randomly. If a spellthief tries to steal a spell that isn't available, the stolen spell (or spell slot) is determined randomly from among those the target has available. For example, a 1st-level spellthief who uses this ability against a 1st-level sorcerer could choose to steal magic missile. Assuming the sorcerer knew that spell, a successful steal spell attack would eliminate one 1st-level spell slot and temporarily prevent her from casting magic missile. If the same spellthief stole magic missile from a wizard who had it prepared, the wizard would lose one prepared magic missile spell (but wouldn't lose any other magic missile spells she might also have prepared). After stealing a spell, a spellthief can cast the spell himself on a subsequent turn. Treat the spell as if it were cast by the original owner of the spell for the purpose of determining caster level, save DC, and so forth. A spellthief can cast this spell even if he doesn't have the minimum ability score normally required to cast a spell of that level. The spellthief must supply the same components (including verbal, somatic, material, XP, and any focus) required for the stolen spell. Alternatively, a spellthief of 4th level or higher can use the stolen spell power to cast any spellthief spell that he knows of the same level or lower (effectively, this gives the spellthief one free casting of a known spell). A spellthief must cast a stolen spell (or use its energy to cast one of his own spells) within 1 hour of stealing it; otherwise, the extra spell energy fades harmlessly away. As a spellthief gains levels, he can choose to steal higher-level spells. At 4th level, he can steal spells of up to 2nd level, and for every two levels gained after 4th, the maximum spell level stolen increases by one (up to a maximum of 9th-level spells at 18th level). At any one time, a spellthief can possess a maximum number of stolen spell levels equal to his class level (treat 0-level spells as 1/2 level for this purpose). For instance, a 4th-level spellthief can have two stolen 2nd-level spells, or one 2nd-level spell and two 1st-level spells, or any other combination of 0-level, 1st-level, and 2nd-level spells totaling four levels. If he steals a spell that would cause him to exceed this limit, he must choose to lose stolen spells sufficient to reduce his total number of stolen spell levels to no more than his maximum. A spellthief can't apply metamagic feats or other effects to the stolen spell unless the specific spell stolen was prepared with such an effect. For example, a spellthief of 6th level or higher could steal a wizard's empowered magic missile, but only if he specifically chose to steal empowered magic missile. If he chose to steal an unmodified magic missile, he couldn't steal an empowered magic missile, a silent magic missile, or any other metamagic form of the spell. A spellthief couldn't steal an empowered magic missile from a sorcerer, since the sorcerer applies metamagic effects upon casting and thus has no prepared empowered magic missile spell. This ability works only against spells. It has no effect on psionic powers or spell-like abilities (but see the steal spell-like ability class feature, below).

Steal Spell Effect		KEY:Spellthief ~ Steal Spell Effect			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a spellthief can siphon an active spell effect from another creature. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain the effect of a single spell affecting the target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell effect with a touch as a standard action. The spellthief can choose which spell effect to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen spell effect randomly. If a spellthief tries to steal a spell effect that isn't present, the stolen spell effect is determined randomly from among those currently in effect on the target. A spellthief can't steal a spell effect if its caster level exceeds his class level + his Charisma modifier. Upon stealing a spell effect, a spellthief gains the stolen effect (and the original creature loses that effect) for 1 minute per class level (or until the spell's duration expires, whichever comes first). If the spell effect's duration hasn't expired by this time, the spell effect returns to the creature that originally benefited from it. A spellthief can steal the effect of a spell only if the spell could be cast on him by the original caster. For example, a spellthief couldn't gain the effect of an animal growth spell (unless the spellthief is of the animal type) or the effect of a shield spell (since that spell's range is personal). If a spellthief tries to steal the effect of a spell not allowed to him, the effect is still suppressed on the original target of the spell for 1 minute per spellthief class level. This ability does not work on spell effects that are immune to dispel magic (such as bestow curse).

A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead temporarily gain resistance 10 to an energy type to which his target is resistant (or immune). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal energy resistance with a touch as a standard action. Simultaneously, the target creature's resistance to that energy type is reduced by 10 (to a minimum of 0). A creature with immunity to an energy type retains that immunity. If his target has more than one type of resistance to energy, a spellthief can choose which kind to steal; otherwise, the DM determines the stolen resistance randomly from among those possessed by the target. If a spellthief chooses to steal a type of resistance that the target doesn't possess, the stolen type of resistance is determined randomly from those possessed by the target. The resistance a spellthief gains from using this ability lasts for 1 minute. If the resistance is derived from a temporary effect (such as a spell), the stolen resistance disappears when the effect expires. A spellthief can use this ability multiple times, but its effects do not stack unless they apply to different types of energy. For example, throughout a long combat, a spellthief might use this ability to gain resistance to fire and resistance to cold, but he could not use it twice on a creature that is resistant to fire to gain twice as much resistance to fire (nor to reduce the creature's resistance to fire by twice as much). At 11th level, a spellthief can steal resistance 20 to an energy type by using this ability, and at 19th level he can steal resistance 30 to an energy type.

Spells				KEY:Spellthief ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality														DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a spellthief gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from a subset of the sorcerer/wizard spell list (see below). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the Player's Handbook). To learn or cast a spell, a spellthief must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, Cha 12 for 2nd-level spells, and so on). The DC for a saving throw against a spellthief's spell is 10 + spell level + spellthief's Cha modifier. Like other spellcasters, a spellthief can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table 1-3: The Spellthief. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-1, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). When Table 1-3 indicates that a spellthief gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 4th-level spellthief), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. A spellthief's selection of spells is extremely limited. A spellthief begins play knowing no spells but gains one or more new spells at certain levels, as indicated on Table 1-4: Spellthief Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, his Charisma does not affect the number of spells he knows; the numbers on Table 1-4 are fixed.) A spellthief can learn any sorcerer/wizard spell from the following schools: abjuration, divination, enchantment, illusion, and transmutation. No other sorcerer/wizard spells are on the spellthief's class spell list. Upon reaching 12th level, and at every third spellthief level after that (15th and 18th), a spellthief can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the spellthief "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level spellthief spell that the spellthief can cast. For instance, upon reaching 12th level, a spellthief could trade in a single 1st-level spell for a different 1st-level spell. A spellthief can swap only a single spell at any given level, and he must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level. At 4th level and higher, a spellthief's caster level for spells is one-half his spellthief level.

Steal Spell-Like Ability	KEY:Spellthief ~ Steal Spell-Like Ability		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:At 5th level and higher, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal a creature's spell-like ability. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain one use of one of the target's spell-like abilities. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell-like ability with a touch as a standard action. This spell-like ability can originate from the target's class, race, template, or any other source, and can be of any level up to a maximum of one-third the spellthief's class level. A spellthief can select a specific spell-like ability to steal; otherwise, the DM chooses the ability at random. If the ability has a limited number of uses per day, the target must have at least one such use left, or the spellthief can't steal the ability. If the target can't use its ability at the present time (such as a summoned demon's summon ability), the spellthief can't steal it. A spellthief can use a stolen spell-like ability once. For all purposes (caster level, save DC, and so on), treat the spell-like ability as if it were being used by the original possessor of the ability. A spellthief must use the stolen spell-like ability within 1 minute of acquiring it, or it is lost harmlessly. Until the spellthief uses the ability (or until the minute elapses), the target cannot use the stolen ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Absorb Spell			KEY:Spellthief ~ Absorb Spell				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Beginning at 7th level, if a spellthief makes a successful save against a spell that targets him, he can attempt to absorb the spell energy for later use. This ability affects only spells that have the spellthief as a target, not effect or area spells. A spellthief can't absorb a spell of a higher spell level than he could steal with his steal spell ability (see above). To absorb a spell that targets him, a spellthief must succeed on a level check (1d20 + spellthief class level) against a DC of 10 + the spell's caster level. Failure indicates that the spell has its normal effect. Success means that the spellthief suffers no effect from the spell and can cast the spell later (or use its energy to cast one of his own spells known) as if he had stolen the spell with his steal spell ability. His normal limit of total spell levels stolen still applies. At 20th level or higher, a spellthief can choose to use the stolen spell energy as an immediate action (see page 137), either to recast the original spell or to cast one of his own spells known using the stolen spell energy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Arcane Sight			KEY:Spellthief ~ Arcane Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Beginning at 9th level, a spellthief can use arcane sight as a swift action (see page 137) a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Discover Spells			KEY:Spellthief ~ Discover Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality											DESC:A spellthief of 13th level or higher who steals a spell from a spellcaster with his steal spell ability automatically learns the names of all other spells prepared or known by the spellcaster that are of the same spell level as the stolen spell. This knowledge allows the spellthief to better choose which spells to steal on subsequent attacks. For example, a 13th-level spellthief who steals disintegrate from an enemy sorcerer would also discover the names of all other 6th-level spells known by that sorcerer.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Steal Spell Resistance		KEY:Spellthief ~ Steal Spell Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellthief Class Feature.SpecialQuality												DESC:Beginning at 15th level, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal some or all of a creature's spell resistance. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead reduce the target's spell resistance by 5. The spellthief also gains spell resistance equal to 5 + his class level (up to a maximum value equal to the original spell resistance of the target). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal spell resistance with a touch as a standard action. The stolen spell resistance benefits the spellthief for a number of rounds equal to the spellthief's Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round) and then returns to the target creature. If the spell resistance is derived from a temporary effect (such as a spell), the stolen spell resistance disappears when the effect elapses. A spellthief can't use this ability on the same creature again until the creature's stolen spell resistance returns.

SOURCEPAGE:p.23
Wild Aspect				KEY:Animal Lord ~ Wild Aspect				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Animal Lord Class Feature.SpecialQuality											DEFINE:WildAspectTimes|0		DESC:At 3rd level and higher, an animal lord can take on an aspect of the animals of his selected group. Assuming a wild aspect is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137). Unless otherwise noted, the effect lasts for 1 minute per level. An animal lord can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels gained after 3rd (twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 9th level). When an animal lord reaches 7th level, his wild aspect becomes more powerful, as described below. If an animal lord has the wild shape ability, he can spend one daily use of wild shape to assume his wild aspect instead (the duration is as normal for the wild aspect). If an animal lord already has a natural attack of the type gained by his wild aspect, use whichever damage figure is superior while the wild aspect is active. If an animal lord wields a weapon while using his wild aspect, he can use the natural attacks gained as natural secondary weapons if he uses his weapon as a primary attack, provided they are still available (an apelord couldn't use a secondary claw attack, for example, if he wields a twohanded weapon).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Lord Choice ~	DESC:Apelord: An apelord gains two primary claw attacks. Each claw deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small apelords). If an apelord hits an opponent with both claw attacks, he rends the foe for an additional 2d4 points of damage (or 2d3 points for Small apelords), plus 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus. At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small apelords) and the rend damage to 2d6 points (or 2d4 points for Small apelords).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Lord Choice ~ Apelord	DESC:Bearlord: A bearlord gains two primary claw attacks.

At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small bearlords).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Lord Choice ~ Bearlord	DESC:Birdlord: A birdlord grows feathery wings, allowing him to fly at his base land speed (average maneuverability). At 7th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Lord Choice ~ Birdlord	DESC:Catlord: A catlord gains two primary claw attacks.

At 7th level, the claw damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small catlords).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Lord Choice ~ Catlord	DESC:Horselord: A horselord's speed, as well as the speed of any horse upon which he rides, improves by 10 feet for a duration of 1 hour per level.

At 7th level, the bite damage increases to 2d6 points (or 1d8 points for Small sharklords).|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Lord Choice ~ Sharklord	DESC:Snakelord: A snakelord gains a poisonous bite as a primary natural attack for 1 round per level. This bite deals 1d4 points of damage (or 1d3 points for Small snakelords).

At 7th level, the bite damage increases to 1d6 points (or 1d4 points for Small snakelords), and the initial and secondary poison damage increases to 1d4 points of Constitution.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Internal,Animal Lord Choice ~ Snakelord	DESC:Wolflord: A wolflord gains the scent ability (see page 314 of the Monster Manual) for 10 minutes per level.

See the druid class feature, pages 35-36 of the Player's Handbook. Treat the beastmaster as a druid whose level is equal to the beastmaster's class level + 3. A beastmaster can select one of the animals available to a 1st-level druid and then apply the modifications as appropriate for a 4th-level druid's animal companion, or she can select a typical version of one of the animals available to a 4th-level druid. As a beastmaster gains class levels, her animal companion gains Hit Dice and other special abilities just as a druid's animal companion does. Use the beastmaster's class level + 3 to determine the animal companion's special abilities. If a beastmaster already has an animal companion from another class, her beastmaster class levels stack with class levels from all other classes that grant an animal companion. For example, a 5th-level druid/2nd-level beastmaster would be treated as a 10th-level druid for the purpose of improving the statistics of her animal companion (and which alternative animal companions she could select).

Mark					KEY:Bloodhound ~ Mark					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Bloodhound Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DEFINE:MarkCount|0			DESC:A bloodhound can target, or mark, an individual humanoid or monstrous humanoid foe to better hunt that enemy. To do so, the bloodhound must focus on a foe who is present and visible, or on the depiction or description of one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption ruins the attempt and forces the bloodhound to start the process again. Once this study is complete, that target is called a mark. A bloodhound adds his bloodhound level as an insight bonus on all Gather Information, Listen, Search, Spot, and Survival checks made to determine the whereabouts of a mark. As a bloodhound gains levels, he gains additional abilities that can be used against a mark. If a bloodhound chooses a new mark before apprehending an existing one, the latter becomes unmarked, and the bloodhound loses experience points equal to the amount he would have earned for defeating that creature. A bloodhound can choose a mark only once a week. Initially, a bloodhound can have only one mark at a time. For every three bloodhound levels gained beyond 1st, a bloodhound can have one additional mark, but only if all the marks are chosen during the same process (see above). For example, a 4th-level bloodhound could mark two bugbears in the same group of prisoners, or the depictions of a bugbear and a hobgoblin if both were studied at the same time. If a bloodhound gives up on apprehending any of his marks, all remaining marked creatures become unmarked as described above.

If the mark triggers the bloodhound's readied action at any point within the next 10 minutes, the bloodhound can carry out his readied action as if the two were engaged in combat (as long as the bloodhound is capable of carrying out that action).

Daggercast				KEY:Daggerspell Mage ~ Daggercast				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Daggerspell Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:Daggerspell mages seamlessly blend the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting abilities. A daggerspell mage can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If a daggerspell mage holds anything other than a dagger, he must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, a daggerspell mage can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.32
Invocation of the Knife		KEY:Daggerspell Mage ~ Invocation of the Knife		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Daggerspell Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, daggerspell mages develop a strong mystical connection between their arcane spellcasting abilities and the daggers that they wield. Whenever a daggerspell mage casts an arcane spell that deals energy damage, he can turn half of the damage dealt by the spell into magic slashing damage rather than energy damage. Energy resistance does not apply to this damage, but damage reduction might. This power does not affect a creature's ability to resist the affected spell with a saving throw or spell resistance. Using this ability does not require an action; its use is part of the action required to cast the affected spell. Only spells with a duration of instantaneous can be modified by this ability.																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.32

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th level.

At 5th level and higher, a mage can hold the charge for one touch spell for each dagger that he is holding in his hands. He must designate which dagger holds each touch spell at the time the spell is cast. If one of these daggers leaves the daggerspell mage's hands, the spell immediately discharges harmlessly (unless the dagger is thrown by a mage with the arcane throw ability; see below).																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.32
Arcane Infusion			KEY:Daggerspell Mage ~ Arcane Infusion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Daggerspell Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality		DESC:At 7th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can infuse arcane spell power into his daggers, temporarily enabling them to deal extra energy damage. To use this ability, a mage must lose a prepared arcane spell from memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). The daggerspell mage chooses one dagger that he is holding and an energy type (fire, cold, or electricity) when this ability is activated. The chosen dagger deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell level sacrificed. Multiple uses of this ability on the same dagger don't stack, even if different energy types are chosen. If the dagger is thrown, the energy damage applies to that attack, but then the effect immediately dissipates. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137).																	SOURCEPAGE:p.32
Arcane Throw			KEY:Daggerspell Mage ~ Arcane Throw				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Daggerspell Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:At 8th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can imbue arcane spell power into his thrown daggers. The mage can deliver a touch spell with a thrown dagger just as if he were making a melee attack. If the dagger hits, the touch spell is discharged against the creature or object struck. If the dagger misses its intended target, the dagger returns to the mage just before his next turn (as if it had the returning special ability; see page 225 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) and retains the spell just as if the mage had missed with a melee attack.

When using this ability, a daggerspell mage can quicken one spell as part of a full attack with his daggers. Doing this has no effect on the spell's effective level. A daggerspell mage must make at least one melee attack in any round in which he uses this ability, and he cannot make an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an attack roll, he can still make the spell's attack). A daggerspell mage can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.33

Wild Shape				KEY:Daggerspell Shaper ~ Wild Shape				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Daggerspell Shaper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Wild Shape	DESC:A daggerspell shaper can change into a Small or Medium animal and back again, and can do so more often than most other characters with the wild shape ability. See the druid class feature, page 37 of the Player's Handbook. This ability lasts for 1 hour per class level or until she changes back. Levels of the daggerspell shaper prestige class stack with druid levels for the purpose of determining the maximum duration of the wild shape ability; they do not stack for any other purpose (such as the size and type of creature that a shaper can become). A daggerspell shaper gains one additional daily use of her wild shape ability at 1st level, 5th level, and 10th level. At 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper becomes able to use her wild shape ability to take the form of a Tiny animal.

Dagger Claws			KEY:Daggerspell Shaper ~ Dagger Claws			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Daggerspell Shaper Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:When a daggerspell shaper of 2nd level or higher uses wild shape, she adds any magical properties of daggers that she is holding in each hand into the natural attacks of her new form. The magic of a single dagger affects only the natural attacks made with the corresponding limb in the shaper's animal form, not all her attacks. For example, a 2nd-level daggerspell shaper holding a +1 flaming dagger in one hand and a +2 keen dagger in the other hand transforms into a leopard. The daggers affect the claw attacks of her new form as follows: One gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the flaming special ability, and the other gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the keen special ability. If the assumed form does not have a claw or slam attack with a limb that corresponds to the druid's natural limbs, this ability has no effect. The bonuses from this ability last for the duration of the wild shape effect. When a shaper uses this ability, her natural weapons in animal form overcome damage reduction exactly as do the daggers that she was holding when she transformed. In the example above, the shaper would be able to overcome a foe's damage reduction as if both of her natural weapons were magic.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.37

Spells per Day				KEY:Vigilante ~ Spells per Day					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality											DESC:A vigilante has the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a vigilante spell, a vigilante must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so if he has a Charisma of 10 or lower, he cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the vigilante's Cha modifier. When a vigilante gets 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance, 1st-level spells at 1st level), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level. The vigilante spell list appears below. A vigilante casts spells just as a bard does. A vigilante's selection of spells is extremely limited. A vigilante begins play knowing two 1st-level spells of his choice. At most new vigilante levels, he gains one or more new spells known as indicated on Table 2-25: Vigilante Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a vigilante knows is not affected by his Charisma score.) Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered level after that, a vigilante can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This works identically to the bard's ability to learn new spells in the place of old ones (see page 28 of the Player's Handbook). A vigilante's spell list includes all spells from the bard spell list that belong to the following schools: abjuration, divination, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.

A vigilante can use this ability multiple times against the same miscreant and in response to the same incident, so long as all such uses occur within the time limit. Should a vigilante mistakenly try to punish someone who is not guilty of the crime witnessed, the benefits do not apply, but the attempt still counts against the number allowed per day. A vigilante can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times per day at 10th level.

Mettle					KEY:Vigilante ~ Mettle							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Vigilante Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:Starting at 9th level, a vigilante's grim determination allows him to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise harm him. If a vigilante makes a successful Will or Fortitude saving throw that would normally reduce the spell's effect (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will partial or Fortitude half ), he instead negates the effect. An unconcsious or sleeping vigilante does not gain the benefit of mettle.

SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Bardic Music				KEY:Virtuoso ~ Bardic Music						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality											DESC:Virtuoso levels stack with bard levels for the purpose of determining the virtuoso's daily uses of his bardic music abilities (if any) and the value of the bonus granted by inspire courage (if the virtuoso has that bardic music ability). For example, a 10th-level bard/4th-level virtuoso could use bardic music fourteen times per day, and his inspire courage ability would grant a +3 morale bonus on the appropriate rolls. A virtuoso also gains the fascinate bardic music ability, if he doesn't already have it. He can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. See the bard class feature, page 29 of the Player's Handbook.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.89
Virtuoso Performance			KEY:Virtuoso ~ Virtuoso Performance					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A virtuoso can use his Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him. He can use this ability once per day per virtuoso level. He can use any form of performance as part of this ability. Although many of the names refer to musical performances, a virtuoso isn't actually so limited-for example, an actor could perform a "sustaining soliloquy" or "sustaining dance" rather than a sustaining song. Each ability requires both a minimum virtuoso level and a minimum number of ranks in any Perform skill to qualify. If a virtuoso does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the virtuoso performance ability until he acquires the needed ranks. Starting a virtuoso performance effect is a standard action. Some virtuoso performance abilities require concentration, which means that the virtuoso must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Unlike with bardic music, virtuoso performance doesn't restrict a virtuoso's spellcasting or magic item activation. If a virtuoso's performance requires sound, a deaf virtuoso has a 20%% chance to fail when attempting to use virtuoso performance. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. If a virtuoso has the bardic music class feature, he can spend two daily uses of bardic music to deliver a virtuoso performance.

Persuasive Song				KEY:Virtuoso Performance ~ Persuasive Song			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A virtuoso with at least 11 ranks in a Perform skill can deliver a performance that sways the attitude of his audience. Treat this as a Diplomacy check made to influence NPC attitudes (see pages 71-72 of the Player's Handbook), but replace the Diplomacy check with a Perform check. Viewers must be within 30 feet of the virtuoso, be able to see and hear him clearly, and be willingly paying attention to his actions. This ability requires at least 10 consecutive rounds of concentration to take effect, and it can affect a particular creature only once per day. Hostile audience members can't be influenced with this ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Sustaining Song				KEY:Virtuoso Performance ~ Sustaining Song			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A virtuoso of 3rd level or higher with at least 13 ranks in a Perform skill can sustain his dying allies, assisting their recovery. Each round that the song continues, all allies within 30 feet of him automatically become stable (if dying) or regain 1 hit point (if stable and between -1 and -9 hit points). A sustaining song has no effect on enemies or on allies with 0 or more hit points. A virtuoso can keep up his sustaining song for 5 minutes. This is a mind-affecting ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Jarring Song				KEY:Virtuoso Performance ~ Jarring Song				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A virtuoso of 5th level or higher with at least 15 ranks in a Perform skill can inhibit spellcasting. Any enemy within 30 feet attempting to cast a spell during a jarring song must make a Concentration check with a DC equal to the virtuoso's Perform check to avoid losing the spell. A virtuoso can keep up his jarring song for 10 rounds.

Song of Fury				KEY:Virtuoso Performance ~ Song of Fury				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A virtuoso of 7th level or higher with at least 17 ranks in a Perform skill can use his performance to turn his allies into furious berserkers. Each ally within 30 feet who can see and hear the virtuoso can choose to enter a rage on her turn. This functions identically to a barbarian's rage, except that it ends automatically if the virtuoso stops performing. If the ally already has the ability to rage, she can choose to apply the full effect of her own rage, without spending one of her daily uses of rage. A virtuoso can't use song of fury on himself. This is a mind-affecting ability.

Mindbending Melody			KEY:Virtuoso Performance ~ Mindbending Melody			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A virtuoso of 9th level or higher with at least 19 ranks in a Perform skill can dominate a humanoid that he has already fascinated. This ability functions like a dominate person spell with a caster level equal to the virtuoso's class level. The target can make a Will save (DC 10 + virtuoso's class level + virtuoso's Cha modifier) to negate the effect. A mindbending melody is a mind-affecting, language-dependent, enchantment (compulsion) ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Revealing Melody				KEY:Virtuoso Performance ~ Revealing Melody			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A 10th-level virtuoso with at least 20 ranks in a Perform skill can use his performance to reveal all things as they actually are. All allies within 30 feet who can see and hear the virtuoso's performance are affected as if by a true seeing spell with a caster level equal to the virtuoso's class level. The effect lasts as long as the virtuoso performs.

Spells per Day/Spells Known		KEY:Virtuoso ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Virtuoso Class Feature.SpecialQuality											DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a virtuoso gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a virtuoso, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
