# Modifier Name	Unique Key			Type		Plus		Visible		Source Page		Required Type			Special Property
Beastskin		KEY:BEASTSKIN_ARMR	TYPE:Armor	PLUS:2	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.127	PRETYPE:2,Armor,Enhancement	SPROP:Whenever you use the wild shape class feature while wearing a suit of armor with the beastskin property, you can expend an additional daily use of your wild shape ability to cause the armor to be transformed with you. When used in this manner, the beastskin armor becomes a suit of armor fitted for your new form rather than simply merging with your body. The armor continues to grant its armor bonus, applying the appropriate armor check penalty, slowing your movement rate, and otherwise functioning as a suit of armor fitted to the new form. The armor's weight increases or decreases to match your new size (and shape, if you assume a quadrupedal form) and therefore might affect your carrying capacity differently than it does in your natural form. If in your natural form you are proficient with the type of armor to which the beastskin quality has been spplied, then you are proficient with the beastskin armor when you are transformed, regardless of what shape you take.
Focused		KEY:FOCUSED_SHLD		TYPE:Shield	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.127	PRETYPE:2,Shield,Enhancement	SPROP:A focused shield helps you anticipate your enemy's moves in battle, helps you see through feints and similar moves, and provides enhanced benefits when you are facing only one creature. A focused shield grants a +10 circumstance bonus on your Sense Motive check that opposes a Bluff check made to feint. In addition, any time when you are threatened by only one creature, the shield bonus to your AC provided by a focused shield improves by 1. This special ability can be applied only to shields, not to armor.

Sizing		KEY:SIZING			TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:1	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.127	PRETYPE:2,Weapon,Enhancement	SPROP:The wielder of a sizing weapon can change the weapon's size category to any other size category as a standard action. Spellcasters who frequently polymorph themselves appreciate weapons with the sizing special ability.
Deadly Precision	KEY:DEADLY_PRECISION	TYPE:Weapon	PLUS:2	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	SOURCEPAGE:p.127	PRETYPE:2,Weapon,Enhancement	SPROP: A deadly precision weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage when its wielder makes a successful sneak attack. This ability does not bestow the ability to make sneak attacks upon a user who does not already have it.
