CATEGORY=Special Ability|Scarlet Corsair ~ Corsair's Feint.MOD			DESC:A Scarlet Corsair is a master of dirty fighting and trickery. A Scarlet Corsair can make a feint as a free action rather than as a move action. But once surprised by a Scarlet Corsair's feint it takes time before enemies can be surprised again. At 3rd level a Scarlet Corsair must wait 2d4 rounds before feinting again. Beginning at 7th level reflexes improve and the wait time drops to 1d4 rounds.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Scarlet Corsair ~ Sailor's Step.MOD			DESC:At 4th level a Scarlet Corsair has learned to use the chaos of a ship at sea to your benefit, taking advantage of the swaying ship and swinging rigging to remain out of reach of opponents. While aboard a ship and wearing nothing more than light armor a +2 dodge bonus to AC is gained. If caught flat-footed or otherwise denied Dexterity bonus then this bonus is lost. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Scarlet Corsair ~ Scourge of the Seas.MOD		DESC:Starting at 5th level a Scarlet Corsair can instill fear in their enemies. When using Intimidate to demoralize foes, the attempt affects all enemies within 30 feet who can see and hear you, for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (%1). This is a mind-affecting ability, and multiple uses of this ability don't stack.|CHA
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Scarlet Corsair ~ Frightening Lunge.MOD		DESC:A Scarlet Corsair's ability to run their enemies through is unnerving to those who cross swords with them. Beginning at 9th level, on a successful sneak attack, you can sacrifice 2d6 damage to render a foe shaken. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty to all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks.

CATEGORY=Special Ability|Stormcaster ~ Thunderclap.MOD					DESC:A Stormcaster can lose any prepared spell or spell slot in order to generate a 30-foot-radius burst of sonic energy. The burst deals 1d4 points of sonic damage per level of the spell slot to all targets in the area; any creature damaged by this effect is stunned for 1 round. A Fortitude save halves this damage and negates the stun effect. You are immune to your own Thunderclap power.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Stormcaster ~ Shield of Winds.MOD				DESC:Starting at 3rd level a Stormcaster can call up high winds to cast aside the arrows of their foes. As an immediate action, %1/day, they can surround their space with an effect equal to a Wind Wall spell for 1 round.|floor(StormcasterLVL/3)
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Stormcaster ~ Eye of the Storm.MOD				DESC:Even in a storm, the winds whipping around a Stormcaster leave them unaffected. Beginning at 4th level, Stormcasters ignore penalties associated with ranged attack rolls and Listen checks due to high winds. Actions that are impossible in high winds (such as using ranged attacks in winds above 50 mph) are still impossible. At 8th level, a Stormcaster gains the ability to share this protection with any number of allies within 30 feet. Granting (or removing) this benefit from any number of allies is a free action.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Stormcaster ~ Thunderbolt.MOD					DESC:Beginning at 5th level, a Stormcaster's knowledge of the storm to add the power of thunder to their lightning-based spells. Any spell they cast that deals electricity damage also deals an extra 1 point of sonic damage per spell level and stuns any creature damaged by the spell for 1 round (Fortitude save negates; DC equals the save DC of the spell even if the spell wouldn't normally allow a save).
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Stormcaster ~ Call Storm.MOD					DESC:At 8th level, a Stormcaster gains the ability to use a Control Weather effect once per week but can only create a windstorm, thunderstorm, or hurricane-force winds. A Stormcaster is treated as a Druid when using this ability for the purpose of duration and area of the spell.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Stormcaster ~ Lord of the Storm.MOD			DESC:At 10th level, a Stormcaster's mastery of the power of the storm is complete. They gain resistance to electricity 30 and resistance to sonic 30. They are immune to being blown away, knocked down, or checked by high winds (whether natural or magical). They gain a +2 competence bonus on saves against spells with Air or Water descriptors.
