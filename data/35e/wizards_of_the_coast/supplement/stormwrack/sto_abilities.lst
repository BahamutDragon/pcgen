#
Water Spell Power						KEY:Aventi ~ Water Spell Power	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Aventi Race Trait.SpecialQuality																					DESC:The magical ties that connect the aventi to Aventernus (see page 49) persist, untold ages since the sea god saved the aventi from extinction. As a result, spellcasting aventi have enchanced ability with water magic. An aventi's effective caster level is +1 for spells with the water descriptor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.34
Human Blood							KEY:Aventi ~ Human Blood		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Aventi Race Trait.SpecialQuality																							DESC:For all effects related to race, an aventi is considered a human.

Race Traits ~ Darfellan											CATEGORY:Internal																																																																																																																																						ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=Darfellan Race Trait
#
Hold Breath							KEY:Darfellan ~ Hold Breath		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Darfellan Race Trait.SpecialQuality																					DESC:A darfellan can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to 8 ? his Constitution score before he risks drowning. For a typical darfellan, this is 96 rounds, or almost 10 minutes.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Natural Attack						KEY:Darfellan ~ Natural Attack	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Darfellan Race Trait.SpecialQuality																							DESC:A darfellan has a natural bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. If fighting without a weapon, a darfellan uses his bite as a primary attack, adding 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus to damage. If armed with a weapon, he can use his bite or weapon, as he chooses. When making a full attack, a darfellan normally uses the weapon as his primary attack along with the bite as a natural secondary attack (at -5 attack). If the darfellan gets extra attacks by virtue of a base attack bonus of +6 or higher, he gets them only with his primary attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Echolocation						KEY:Darfellan ~ Echolocation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Darfellan Race Trait.SpecialQuality																							DESC:In the water, a darfellan can emit a series of whistles, then instinctively pinpoint nearby creatures by hearing the echo.

SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Racial Hatred						KEY:Darfellan ~ Racial Hatred		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Darfellan Race Trait.SpecialQuality																							DESC:A darfellan normally exudes a brooding calm, but the mere presence of a sahuagin is enough to send the darfellan into a blood-mad fury. Darfellans gain a +2 racial bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when fighting sahuagin.
