You create a CR 1 trap selected from the following list: basic arrow trap, fusillade of darts, scything blade trap, or spear trap (DMG 70-71). You can locate the 5-foot-by-5-foot trigger in any square of your choice within the range of this spell. Once create trap is cast, the trap is active and ready to be sprung, with every design feature installed. Material Component: A miniature bronze gear.
Essence of the Dragon										TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=2				SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:S, M		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Willing living creature touched												DURATION:1 minute/level										SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.112	DESC:You confer the dragon type on the touched creature. For the duration of the spell, that creature counts as a dragon for the purpose of spell effects, magic item wielder requirements, favored enemy bonuses, and other factors that depend on a creature's type. the subject of the spell is immune to magic sleep and paralysis effects and ignores the frightful presence of dragons. the recipient also receives darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. It is also now vulnerable to harmful effects that specify dragons, such as dragon bane weapons. Material Component: A drop of blood from a dragon or dragon-descended creature.
Ghostly Reload											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=1			SCHOOL:Transmutation										COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch				TARGETAREA:Hand, light, or heavy crossbow													DURATION:1 hour or until expended; see text						SAVEINFO:No						SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:Shimmering ghostly hands pull your crossbow's string back into the catch as you prepare to fire another bolt. After the wielder shoots a projectile from the crossbow affected by this spell, the magic immediately cocks the crossbow so that the weapon can be loaded again. Ghostly reload pulls the string of a hand crossbow or light crossbow into place once per caster level (maximum ten times at caster level 10th) and the string of a heavy crossbow into place once per two caster levels (maximum five times at caster level 10th). Cumulative castings of ghostly reload do not stack. This spell allows the crossbow's wielder to fire a light crossbow or heavy crossbow as a standard action and move in the same round. If the character benefits from a high base attack bonus, the crossbow can be fired multiple times as a full attack, but only if ghostly reload can be applied to each attack in that round. Focus: A crossbow.
Ghostly Tail											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=1				SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:Evoked tail																DURATION:1 hour/level																					SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:A partially translucent, scaled tail uncoils from behind you, as if it had always been there, and slaps at foes that leave themselves open to attack. You evoke a partially translucent, scaled tail that can attack foes that are vulnerable to attacks of opportunity. If your foe takes an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity from you, even if you are not holding a melee weapon that would normally threaten your foe, your evoked dragon's tail attacks the target with a melee touch attack, dealing 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. You can only strike with a ghostly tail if you have not already taken your allowed number of attacks of opportunity in the round. Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, deals an extra 1 point of damage per level with a ghostly tail (maximum 20 points).
Gnome Blight											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high										DURATION:1 round/level (D)									SAVEINFO:Fortitude negates; see text	SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You blow a mixture of pollen and ground mandrake root from your palm toward the targeted area. the granules are carried by a directed wind and explode into a cloud of yellow dust and seed. Gnome blight creates a thick cloud of agonizingly itchy pollen similar to that created by fog cloud, except that the pollen is sickening. Living creatures in the cloud become sickened. This condition lasts as long as a creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each sickened individual.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. Creatures with sensitive olfactory senses (such as gnomes or creatures with the scent ability) take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. Material Component: Flower pollen and ground mandrake root.
Hoard Life												TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=4				SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Healing							COMPS:V, S, F	CASTTIME:1 minute			RANGE:Personal and touch	TARGETAREA:You																	DURATION:1 hour/level (D)																				SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:You clasp your hands around a gem. A flash goes off, and then a feeling of deep weariness passes through you. the gem now bears a spark of light within it. Although true healing magic is usually the province of the divine, dragon sorcerers have devised an arcane method of creating a "reserve" of health for use in emergencies. This spell siphons off hit points from the caster and temporarily stores them in a gem for later retrieval. When you cast this spell, you deal nonlethal damage equal to twice your caster level to yourself, and you become fatigued. (If you are immune to nonlethal damage, this spell automatically fails.) At any point during the spell's duration, you can use a standard action while holding the gem to heal yourself of an amount of damage equal to the nonlethal damage the spell dealt to you. This healing can't cause you to exceed your full normal hit points; any healing in excess of this amount is lost. Triggering this effect ends the spell's duration (so you can't portion out the healing over multiple uses). Triggering the healing does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the spell's duration elapses before you have triggered the healing, you gain no benefit from the spell. Casting this spell a second time automatically ends the duration of any previous casting of the spell that you have performed. Focus: A gem worth at least 50 gp. Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.
Instant Diversion											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard=1		SCHOOL:Illusion		SUBSCHOOL:Figment							COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal; see text	TARGETAREA:You																	DURATION:1 round																						SOURCEPAGE:p.113	DESC:As you spin around, you produce residual images of yourself, each of which splits off from your body and moves away. One or more illusory doubles of you appear, spinning off from your original location as you turn in a circle. You create one double plus one for every four caster levels you have (minimum one, maximum five). You are then free to go elsewhere while your doubles move away in a manner of your choosing. the doubles move at your speed and can emit minor sounds such as footsteps or metal clanking, but they can only be made to move, withdraw, or run. Any successful attack against an illusory double destroys it. A double's Armor Class is equal to 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking as though they are burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).
Local Tremor											TYPE:Arcane.Divine	CLASSES:Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard=2	SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Earth			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:30 ft.			TARGETAREA:30-ft. line																DURATION:1 minute/level or until expended; see text					SAVEINFO:Reflex negates				SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:The earth around your feet begins to ripple, and a directed shock wave of tectonic force is released that shoots through the ground. Immediately upon completion of the casting of this spell and as often as once per round thereafter, you can cause the ground to shake along a 30- foot line. You can produce a number of these tremors equal to your caster level (maximum five). the tremors begin at your location and extend in the direction you indicate; any creature caught standing within the area must make a Reflex save or fall prone. A spellcaster caught standing on one of these squares must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell that was being attempted. You need not produce a tremor immediately upon finishing the casting of this spell. You can perform other actions, even the casting of other spells, between producing new tremors. Calling up a new tremor in any round after the spell has been cast requires a standard action (as you refocus your concentration on the spell).
Manifest Dragon Heritage									TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=5				SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 full round		RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One wyvern																DURATION:1 round/level (D)									SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:With a shuddering gasp, you dig your nails into your flesh as though pulling the skin from your bones. A glistening wyvern appears before you. This spell creates a wyvern that springs forth from your body. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. You must be able to speak Draconic to communicate with the wyvern, or have some form of telepathic communication that does not require a shared language. If you can communicate with the wyvern, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. the conjured creature gains bonus hit points equal to twice your caster level. If it is killed, the caster takes 2d6 points of damage.

For a Small weapon that increases by more than one size category, begin by referring to the table in the mighty wallop spell description. Once the weapon has been adjusted to an effective size of Medium, or if it was already a Medium or larger weapon, refer to Table 2-2: Increasing Damage by Weapon Size (DMG 28).

A successful Reflex save means the creature can move from its space but is still considered entangled as long as it remains in the area. A creature stuck in place can break loose by using a standard action to make a DC 15 Strength check or Escape Artist check. Each round at the beginning of your turn, any creature within the area must succeed on another Reflex save to avoid becoming stuck in place again. the effect of this spell even extends through footwear, so merely removing your boots doesn't free you from the effect. Creatures not in contact with the surface of the ground (such as flying, burrowing or incorporeal creatures) are unaffected by sticky floor. Kobold sorcerers often use this spell to protect their lairs, and some theorize that they learned it from dragons. Material Component: A drop of hardened tree sap, which must be eaten by the caster.

In addition, if a subject of up to one size category larger than you fails a Strength check (DC equal to your caster level + 12) against your first attack, the driving force of the tail slap pushes your foe back 5 feet plus another 5 feet for every 5 points of damage your foe takes. If a wall or other solid object prevents the subject from being pushed back, the subject instead slams into the object and takes an extra 2d6 points of damage from the impact (no save). the movement of your foe caused by a tail slap does not provoke attacks of opportunity. the chance to push your foe back is only gained on the attack you make in the round when you initially cast the spell. Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, has a chance to push back a foe with every attack it makes during the spell's duration, instead of just the first attack made in the round when the spell is cast.

Creatures that fail the Reflex save are also knocked prone. Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, casts this spell at +1 caster level.
Unfettered Grasp											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=2			SCHOOL:Enchantment	SUBSCHOOL:Compulsion	DESCRIPTOR:Mind-Affecting	COMPS:V		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Close				TARGETAREA:One grappling or pinned creature												DURATION:Instantaneous										SAVEINFO:None					SPELLRES:Yes		SOURCEPAGE:p.118	DESC:Upon casting this spell, you force the target creature to immediately attempt a grapple check. If it succeeds on that check, the creature immediately ends and escapes from any grapple or pin that it is currently subject to (even if it isn't the creature's turn). Typically, this spell is used to free an ally from the grasp of a creature that is larger and/or stronger than the ally. This spell was developed by dragonborn sorcerers to better face the threat of their enormous dragon enemies (many of which have the ability to snatch up smaller foes).
Wall of Scales											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=4				SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Creation						COMPS:V, S, M	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Medium			TARGETAREA:Dragonhide wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square per level (S)							DURATION:1 minute/level										SAVEINFO:See text					SPELLRES:No			SOURCEPAGE:p.118	DESC:You create a barrier of living dragonhide that is anchored to the ground or floor, or between two vertical surfaces. A wall of scales is 1 inch thick per two caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. the wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. You can create a wall of scales in almost any shape you desire, provided it is anchored in some fashion. It need not be vertical, and you can shape it into a circular or domeshaped enclosure about yourself or another creature. the wall can be destroyed by normal means of dealing damage, as well as by disintegrate spells and so forth. It is immune to acid and fire. In addition, the wall of scales has damage reduction 5/magic. For every five caster levels above 5th, this damage reduction increases by 5, reaching a maximum of 20/magic at 20th level. Each 5-foot square of wall has 10 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points are reduced to 0 is breached. It is not possible to break a wall of scales with a Strength check. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of scales, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves. Material Component: A pristine dragon scale.
Wings of Bounding											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=1				SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 swift action		RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You																	DURATION:Instantaneous																					SOURCEPAGE:p.119	DESC:You evoke immense, partially translucent wings that grant you a +20 circumstance bonus on a Jump check you make in the same round when you cast the spell. In addition, if you are intentionally jumping down from a height and you succeed on the DC 15 Jump check to do so, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 30 fewer feet than you actually did. Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, gains an additional +1 bonus on the Jump check for every two caster levels (maximum +10).
Wings of Cover											TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=2				SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 immediate action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You																	DURATION:Instantaneous																					SOURCEPAGE:p.119	DESC:Your evoked wings grant cover against a specific attack. If your foe is about to attack you with a melee, ranged, spell, or psionic attack, you can cast this spell immediately, creating a hemispherical barrier (or a spherical barrier if you are not standing on solid ground) of force shaped like dragon wings. the wings of force last just long enough to disrupt your foe's line of effect to you, providing you total cover against a single attack with a weapon, spell, or psionic power. Your foe's first attack in this round cannot be made and is wasted against you, though he could decide to take any other action, including choosing to attack one of your allies instead, or take a full attack action that grants him additional melee attacks against you in this round (if your foe is of high enough level to have additional attacks). the wings unfurl and then dissipate an instant later. Your foe could choose to attack the area in which you have taken cover with an area attack (such as a fireball spell). In this case, you gain a +8 bonus to AC (if applicable) and a +4 bonus on Reflex saves. Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, can provide cover for one additional adjacent ally for every three caster levels.

Wings of Swift Flying										TYPE:Arcane			CLASSES:Sorcerer=1				SCHOOL:Evocation						DESCRIPTOR:Force			COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Personal			TARGETAREA:You																	DURATION:1 hour/level or until underlying flight effect lapses; see text												SOURCEPAGE:p.119	DESC:After you have already cast fly or overland flight or are enjoying some other temporary power or magical flight effect, you can cast wings of swift flying to increase your speed. This spell evokes ghostly, translucent wings that add 30 feet to your fly speed granted by the underlying spell for that spell's duration. When the underlying flight effect's duration elapses, the wings of swift flying spell also immediately ends. Only characters who are already enjoying the effect of flight granted by a spell, power, or other temporary magical or psionic effect can make use of this spell. Characters who are flying through some other means (such as natural wings of their own) gain no benefit from casting this spell. Special: A dragonblooded character, or a character with the dragon type, adds an additional 10 feet to her fly speed when this spell is cast (total 40-foot bonus to fly speed).

Breath Barrier											TYPE:Psionic		CLASSES:Psion,Psychic Warrior,Wilder=3	SCHOOL:Metacreativity										COMPS:Visual	CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:10 ft.			TARGETAREA:10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you											DURATION:1 minute/level (D)																				SOURCEPAGE:p.120	DESC:You create a quasi-real barrier in the shape of a sphere that shimmers with golden sparkles and moves with you. Creatures and objects can enter or leave the area unimpeded. A breath barrier blocks fog, foglike effects, and gases created by spells such as fog cloud or cloudkill or by breath weapons that are poison gas. When used as a barrier against breath weapons that deal hit point damage directly, the sphere absorbs up to 60 points of damage from one or more breath weapons before collapsing (at which time the power ends). A breath barrier takes damage as though it were a creature that failed its saving throw against the breath weapon being used. Augment: For every 2 additional power points you spend, the barrier can absorb an additional 12 points of breath weapon damage before collapsing.
