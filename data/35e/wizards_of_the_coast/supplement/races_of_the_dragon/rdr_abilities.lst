Dragonborn Racial Traits				KEY:Race Traits ~ Dragonborn		SORTKEY:Racial Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality													DESC:A dragonborn combines some of the racial traits of her original race and her new form. Only those traits gained from transformation are given here; see also the Mechanics of Rebirth sidebar.	DESC:&nl;+2 Constitution, -2 Dexterity. Dragonborn are hearty and healthy, but they are awkward in their newly adopted bodies.	DESC:&nl;Humanoid (dragonblood): Dragonborn are humanoids with the dragonblood subtype and any other subtypes they had before undergoing the Rite of Rebirth. For all effects related to race, a dragonborn is considered a dragon and a member of her original race.	DESC:&nl;Age: After a dragonborn underoes the Rite of Rebirth, she emerges as an adult creature regardless of her previous age. If she lives for 200 years (see Table 1-1, page 10), she enters middle age.	DESC:&nl;+2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the dragon type. The dragonborn have an innate sense of how best to defend themselves against their potential enemies.	DESC:&nl;Immunity to Frightful Presence: Dragonborn are immune to the frightful presence ability of dragons, just as if they were dragons.	DESC:&nl;Draconic Aspect: Bahamut has blessed the dragonborn with aspects combining some of the best attributes of good dragons. Upon completing the Rite of Rebirth, a dragonborn chooses which of the following three aspects to manifest. Once the choice is made, it cannot be changed.	DESC:&nl;Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass dragonborn's fighter class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for being a multiclassed character. Furthermore, dragonborn paladins can leave that class and return to it without penalty. Also, see the Mechanics of Rebirth sidebar.

# Dragonborn Draconic Aspects
Heart								KEY:Dragonborn ~ Heart			SORTKEY:Racial Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Dragonborn Race Trait.Dragonborn Draconic Aspect.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dragonborn who chooses heart as her draconic aspect gains a breath weapon. The breath weapon is a bright, shining line that coruscates with every metallic color. The line's length is 5 feet per Hit Die the dragonborn has, up to a maximum of 100 feet at 20 HD. The breath weapon deals 1d8 points of damage, plus an extra 1d8 points for each 3 HD the dragonborn possesses (2d8 at 3 HD, 3d8 at 6 HD, and so on). The damage can be acid, cold, electricity, or fire, changing on each use as the dragonborn chooses. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the dragonborn's HD + her Con modifier) halves the damage. A dragonborn can use her breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Mind								KEY:Dragonborn ~ Mind			SORTKEY:Racial Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Dragonborn Race Trait.Dragonborn Draconic Aspect.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dragonborn who selects the mind aspect sharpens her senses, gaining immunity to paralysis and magic sleep effects. She gains darkvision out to 30 feet and low-light vision, plus a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. At 6 HD, the dragonborn's darkvision extends to 60 feet. At 9 HD, the dragonborn's darkvision extends to 90 feet, and her low-light vision allows her to see three times as far as a human in shadowy illumination. At 12 HD, the dragonborn's darkvision extends to 120 feet, and her low-light vision allows her to see four times as far as a human in shadowy illumination. At 15 HD, the dragonborn gains blindsense out to 30 feet.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.9
Wings								KEY:Dragonborn ~ Wings			SORTKEY:Racial Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Race Trait.Dragonborn Race Trait.Dragonborn Draconic Aspect.SpecialQuality	DESC:A dragonborn who selects the wings aspect hatches sporting fully formed wings. Dragonborn can use these wings to aid their jumps (granting a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks) and to glide. Those with 6 HD or more can use their wings to fly. Gliding: A dragonborn can use her wings to glide, negating damage from a fall from any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. Dragonborn glide at a speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Even if a dragonborn's maneuverability improves, she can't hover while gliding. A dragonborn can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If a dragonborn becomes unconscious or helpless while in midair, her wings naturally unfurl, and powerful ligaments stiffen them. The dragonborn descends slowly in a tight corkscrew and takes only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter the actual distance of the fall. Flight: When a dragonborn who selected the wings aspect reaches 6 HD, she gains a f ly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. A dragonborn can't f ly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. A dragonborn can safely fly for a number of consecutive rounds equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). She can double this length of flight but is fatigued by such exertion. The dragonborn is likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because a dragonborn can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, she can remain aloft for extended periods, even if she can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued. When she reaches 12 HD, a dragonborn has enough stamina and prowess to fly without tiring. She can fly at a speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability) with no more exertion than walking or running. A dragonborn with flight can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but the dragonborn must move a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. A dragonborn can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon. If the dive attack hits, it deals double damage. A dragonborn with flight can use the run action while flying, provided she flies in a straight line.	DESC:&nl;Automatic Languages: Draconic. Dragonborn gain the ability to speak Draconic upon their transformation but do not lose the ability to speak languages they already know.																											SOURCEPAGE:p.9

BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Kobold SLA|1	BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|-1						BONUS:VAR|KoboldDraconicRiteTimes|1											COST:1																	BENEFIT:Upon completing this rite, a kobold chooses any 1st-level sorcerer spell. He can now use that spell once per day as a spell-like ability, using his character level as his caster level. Each day, a kobold must complete the Searching for the Dragon meditation (see above) in order to recharge this spell-like ability for the day. No kobold can benefit from this rite more than once. Time: A kobold who undergoes this rite must first endure nine days of fasting. Immediately thereafter, the kobold must succeed on a DC 10 Concentration check to enter a deep trance that lasts for 24 hours. If the check fails, the rite must begin anew.

A kobold requires no one else to perform the rite; it is a solitary activity.							DESC:The Greater Draconic Rite of Passage is a powerful ritual handed down from dragons to kobolds as a reward for their undying loyalty. In the same way that chromatic and metallic dragons gain integrated levels of sorcerer spellcasting as they age, this ritual allows kobolds to awaken a small amount of their own arcane might.																													BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|-3	BONUS:PCLEVEL|Sorcerer|1																	COST:0																	BENEFIT:Upon completing this rite, a kobold gains new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if also gaining one level in the sorcerer class. The kobold does not, however, gain any other benefit a sorcerer would have gained (familiar abilities, and so on). The benefit of this ritual is automatically factored into the 15 minutes that a kobold sorcerer spends concentrating to ready their daily allotment of spells. No kobold can benefit from this rite more than once. Time: A kobold who undergoes this rite must first endure nine days of fasting (the equivalent of three days for a kobold in a region above 40 degrees F). Immediately thereafter, the kobold must succeed on a DC 20 Concentration check to enter a deep trance that lasts for 24 hours. If the check fails, the rite must begin a new. Cost: This rite requires sacrificing a gem of at least 1,000 gp in value. The kobold also permanently loses 3 hit points upon completion of the rite, the price of unlocking latent draconic energy within their soul.

As a standard action, you can create a magical sensor that provides visual information as the arcane eye spell (PH 173), for up to 1 minute per day per disciple level (which can be expended gradually, minimum 1 round). The effect of this ability is identical to that of the arcane eye spell, except that the magical sensor is shaped like a dragon of Fine size.

This ability takes effect automatically whenever you make an attack roll against an opponent that has fewer Hit Dice than your character level. The target of your attack must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Dragons and creatures with the dragonblood subtype are immune to this effect. Creatures that succeed on this save can't be affected again by your frightful attack for 24 hours.

# Dracolexi
Spellcasting			KEY:Dracolexi ~ Spellcasting										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dracolexi Class Feature.SpecialQuality																								DESC:At each level beyond 1st, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a dracolexi, you must decide which class to add each level to for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.79
Draconic Words			KEY:Dracolexi ~ Draconic Words				SORTKEY:Draconic Words A	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dracolexi Class Feature.SpecialQuality										DEFINE:DracolexiDraconicWordLVL|0	DEFINE:DracolexiDraconicWordCount|0	DESC:When you enter this class, you begin to discover the arcane nuances that allow specific spoken Draconic words to produce powerful effects. Your intuitive understanding of how to express these words cannot be imparted to others. Even if one of these words is repeated perfectly by someone else, the utterance has no effect, because the speaker lacks the internalized understanding that can only come from the special studies that dracolexi engage in. At 1st level and every three levels thereafter (4th, 7th, and 10th), you can learn one Draconic word from among those described below in order to use it and gain the benefit of its effect. Some Draconic words have a class level requirement that must be met before the word can be learned. You can't learn the same word twice. Speaking a word is a swift action (see page 122) that activates the word's effect; if the word affects a particular creature, you can target any creature (including yourself) within 30 feet. A silence spell or similar effect prevents you from using Draconic words; if you are deafened, you have a 20%% chance of misspeaking a Draconic word when using it (this counts as a use of the word but has no effect). Beginning at 4th level, you can choose to incorporate a known Draconic word into the verbal component of a spontaneously cast arcane spell as you cast it (which requires no action other than the normal casting of the spell). In this case, the word takes effect at the end of the spell's casting time, just before the spell takes effect. If the Draconic word would normally target a specific creature, it can only target a creature that is targeted by the spell, or a single creature within the area of the spell. A spell cast without a verbal component can't have a Draconic word added to its effect. You can use each Draconic word any number of times per day, but no more than one word can be used each round (nor can you use the same word more than once per round). No creature can be targeted by the same Draconic word twice in a 24-hour period. If a saving throw is allowed against the power of the Draconic word, the save DC is 10 + your dracolexi level + your Cha modifier.

Bonus Feat				KEY:Dracolexi ~ Bonus Feat										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dracolexi Class Feature.SpecialQuality																								DESC:A dracolexi learns how to rely on little but her own voice to cast spells. At 2nd level, you gain your choice of Eschew Materials or Still Spell as a bonus feat. If you already have these feats, you gain nothing from this class feature.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.80
Power Word Spells			KEY:Dracolexi ~ Power Word Spells									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dracolexi Class Feature.SpecialQuality																						DESC:The words of Draconic power share some fundamental similarities to the various power word spells (those in the Player's Handbook as well as the ten new power word spells presented in Chapter 7 of this book), and your studies shed new light on the use of these magical effects. At 3rd level, you can select any single power word spell and add it to the spell list of any one spontaneous arcane spellcasting class that you have, treating it as a spell of one level lower than normal. If your class spell list doesn't normally include spells of the (adjusted) level of the power word spell, you can't add it to your spell list. For example, a 5th-level bard/3rd-level dracolexi could select power word distract (see page 115). It is normally a 4th-level spell, but he can treat it as a 3rdlevel bard spell. He could even choose power word blind (normally a 7th-level spell) and add it to his class spell list as a 6th-level bard spell, despite the fact that he is not yet capable of casting 6th-level bard spells. He couldn't choose power word kill or power word stun with this ability, since even with the adjustment these would be 8th-level and 7th-level spells, respectively, which aren't normally available to bards. Furthermore, if you are (or become) capable of casting spells of that level, you can also add the power word spell to your list of spells known. If you already know the selected power word spell, you can move that spell to one level lower on your class spell list and also add any spell of the power word spell's original level to your spell list. The bard in the previous example couldn't add power word disable (normally a 5th-level spell) to his list of spells known until he was capable of casting 4th-level bard spells. A 9th-level sorcerer/3rd-level dracolexi, on the other hand, could immediately add power word disable to his list of spells known, since he is capable of casting 4th-level spells. If he already knew power word disable as a 5th-level spell, he would add it to his list of 4th-level spells known and then add a different 5th-level sorcerer spell of his choice to his spells known list. At 6th level and again at 9th level, you can select another power word spell in this fashion.																															SOURCEPAGE:p.80
Bonus Spells Known		KEY:Dracolexi ~ Bonus Spells Known									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dracolexi Class Feature.SpecialQuality																								DESC:A dracolexi is particularly talented in using spells that incorporate language and speech. At 5th level, you can add any two languagedependent spells from your class's spell list to your list of spells known for that class. The spells must be of a level you are capable of casting, and the two spells must be of different levels. For example, a 5th-level sorcerer/5th-level dracolexi could add lesser geas (a 4th-level sorcerer spell) and suggestion (a 3rd-level sorcerer spell) to his list of spells known. He couldn't learn command (since it's a cleric spell) or mass suggestion (since it's a 6th-level spell and beyond his ability to cast).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.81
Voice in Silence			KEY:Dracolexi ~ Voice in Silence									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Dracolexi Class Feature.SpecialQuality																						DESC:When coupled with arcane energy, your voice becomes potent enough to temporarily overcome areas of silence or even your own deafness. Beginning at 8th level, you can expend an arcane spell slot as a move action to suppress all silence spells (or similar effects) in your space, and to render your voice audible to you and other creatures sharing your space even if you or they are deafened. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Only you (and any other creatures sharing your space) benefit from this effect; adjacent creatures that are deafened or within a silence effect are still affected by the deafness or silence. The effect moves with you.

(The skirmish class feature is described in the scout class, and the sudden strike class feature is found in the ninja class; both of these classes appear in Complete Adventurer.) You must already have the sneak attack, skirmish, or sudden strike class feature in order to choose this option. If you have more than one of these class features, you must apply the bonus to a single class feature (but you can choose a different class feature at 4th level from what you chose at 2nd level).

Beginning at 3rd level, you can ignore the arcane spell failure chance when casting 0-level and 1st-level arcane spells. This benefit doesn't apply to spells higher than 1st level, including 0-level or 1st-level spells that occupy a higher-level spell slot because of the application of a metamagic feat.

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you don't have any levels in sorcerer before reaching 3rd level in this class, you gain spells per day, spells known, and an increase in caster level as if you were a 1st-level sorcerer. You use all the normal rules for sorcerer spellcasting as described in the Player's Handbook. Upon reaching 3rd level in this class, you add magic fang to your sorcerer spell list as a 1st-level spell and greater magic fang to your sorcerer spell list as a 3rd-level spell. You can choose these spells as spells known (assuming, in the latter case, that you are able to know and cast 3rdlevel sorcerer spells), and you can use spell trigger items such as wands that contain these spells.

As a dragonheart mage, you realize some additional benefits from taking this feat. As stated in the feat description on page 102, you can use a standard action to change arcane spell energy into a breath weapon that deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell that you expend.

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained.

SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Aspect of Peace			KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Peace							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Singer of Concordance Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:Upon entering this class, you attune yourself to the great Song of Io and to one Sphere of Concordance that is sustained by Io's song. In so doing, you draw that sphere's aspect of peace spiritually closer to you and the reality you inhabit. This effect is always active while you are conscious (and the effect moves with you), but not if you are unconscious or dead. It grants you immunity to the first compulsion effect (magical or otherwise) that would otherwise affect you each day, and for the remainder of the day grants you a +4 morale bonus on saving throws to resist further compulsion effects. Each ally within 10 feet of you at any time during the day feels a reflection of the Sphere of Concordance's aspect of peace and gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects. As you gain levels as a Singer of Concordance, you gain the ability to call up additional aspects of a Sphere of Concordance. As this occurs, you can enjoy multiple aspects operating simultaneously, without conflict. In fact, the more aspects called into existence, the closer you draw to your chosen Sphere of Concordance .																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.91
Bonus Domain			KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Bonus Domain								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Singer of Concordance Class Feature.SpecialQuality																						DESC:At 2nd level, you gain access to an additional cleric domain from the following list of domains: Dragon*, Healing, Knowledge, Magic, Strength, Travel, or Wealth.

SOURCEPAGE:p.92
Aspect of Refuge			KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Refuge							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Singer of Concordance Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:At 3rd level, you increase your attunement to your sphere, allowing you to call upon its aspect of refuge. You can call up this effect as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action (see page 122) or as a free action made in conjunction with attacking any other creature (automatic dismissal), or by moving more than 20 feet from where you first called up the aspect of refuge. All creatures within 20 feet of you that attempt to strike or otherwise target any other creature, even with a spell, must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). If the save succeeds, the creature can attack normally and is not affected. If the save fails, the creature can't follow through with the attack. That part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack another creature while it remains within the refuge. Creatures that do not attempt to target another creature with an attack or other effect remain unaffected. The refuge does not prevent creatures within 20 feet of you from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells, or from other attacks launched from farther away. You can use nonattack spells or otherwise act within the refuge without dismissing it. For instance, you could heal wounds, cast a bless spell, perform an augury, or summon creatures.

Aspect of Exclusion		KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Exclusion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Singer of Concordance Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DEFINE:AspectOfExclusionTimes|0							DESC:At 5th level, you further increase your attunement to your sphere, allowing you to call upon its aspect of exclusion once per day for a period of up to 1 round per caster level. You can call up this effect as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action or by moving more than 10 feet from where you first called up the aspect of exclusion. The aspect of exclusion appears as an immobile, faintly shimmering sphere that surrounds you and all creatures within 10 feet of you. This aspect prevents all spell effects of 4th level or lower from entering the sphere. This effect is otherwise identical to globe of invulnerability (and is considered a 6th-level spell effect). After reaching 8th level, you can use this ability twice per day.

Aspect of Healing			KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Healing							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Singer of Concordance Class Feature.SpecialQuality																				DESC:At 6th level, you become able to call upon your sphere's aspect of healing. This aspect is always active while you are conscious (and the effect moves with you), but not if you are unconscious or dead. Any healing performed within 10 feet of you (and any healing you initiate) cures an additional 1d8 points. Undead within 10 feet of you that are dealt damage by a cure spell take an additional 1d8 points of damage.

Aspect of Safety			KEY:Singer of Concordance ~ Aspect of Safety							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Singer of Concordance Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DEFINE:AspectOfSafetyTimes|0								DESC:At 9th level, you can call upon your sphere's aspect of safety once per day for a period of up to 1 minute per caster level. You can call up the effect as a standard action, and dismiss it as a swift action or by moving more than 10 feet from where you first called up the aspect of safety. The area within the 10-foot-radius sphere surrounding you is impervious to planar travel of any sort, except if such travel is initiated by you. The effect also deals 6d6 points of damage to creatures that attempt to enter it other than those you designate. A Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) halves the damage dealt. An undesignated creature within the sphere takes no further damage beyond the initial 6d6 points, unless it exits and then attempts to reenter.

Turn Energy				KEY:Dragonblood Cleric ~ Turn Energy		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dragonblood Cleric Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:Starting at 1st level, a dragonblood cleric can channel the elemental power of dragons to grant her and her allies protection from energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The cleric and all allies within 30 feet gain temporary immunity to the specified energy type. Each protected ally remains immune until the effect protects him from 5 points of energy damage per cleric level, after which the effect is discharged for that ally. If it is not discharged, the benefit of the effect fades after 1 minute per cleric level. The cleric can exclude herself and any allies she chooses from the effect. Turn energy overlaps and does not stack with the effect of the resist energy spell. If a character is warded by both this effect and resist energy, this effect absorbs damage until it is discharged. Turn energy stacks with the effect of the protection from energy spell. This substitution level class feature replaces the standard cleric's turn or rebuke undead class feature. For a dragonblood cleric, turn energy counts as turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for feats, prestige classes, and so on.																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.106
Energy Barrier			KEY:Dragonblood Cleric ~ Energy Barrier		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dragonblood Cleric Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A dragonblood cleric who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to create a wall of energy. This ability functions like the benefit of the Exhaled Barrier feat (see page 101), except as noted below. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of energy damage per two cleric levels the dragonblood cleric possesses. If the cleric creates the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the cleric's class level + her Con modifier) halves this damage. This substitution feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 5th level. From 5th level on, a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can prepare one less 3rd-level spell per day than shown on Table 3-6 (PH 31).																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.106
Energy Sustenance			KEY:Dragonblood Cleric ~ Energy Sustenance	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dragonblood Cleric Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:A dragonblood cleric who takes the 9th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to gain the benefit of energy sustenance. The energy type selected for this ability can now heal the cleric. To use energy sustenance, the cleric expends a turn energy use as an immediate action when she is subjected to an attack that deals energy damage of the specified type. If she does so, she heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the cleric to exceed her full normal hit points, she gains any excess as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour. When a dragonblood cleric uses this ability, she willingly fails any saving throw against the incoming energy effect. This substitution feature replaces the 5th-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 9th level. From 9th level on, a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can prepare one less 5th-level spell per day than shown on Table 3-6 (PH 31).

Spell-Like Ability		KEY:Dragonblood Sorcerer ~ Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dragonblood Sorcerer Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to transform a sorcerer spell he knows into a spell-like ability. A spell chosen for this ability can't have a costly material component, an XP cost, or any sort of focus, and it can't be a spell of the highest level the sorcerer can cast. The chosen spell is removed from the sorcerer's list of spells known, reducing his number of known spells of that level by one, and the sorcerer loses one spell slot of that spell level-as well as one spell slot from the next higher level of spells he is able to cast. In return for those two spell slots, he gains the ability to use the chosen spell as a spell-like ability three times per day, using his sorcerer level as the caster level. Each time a dragonblood sorcerer who has this substitution level feature gains access to a new spell level, he can exchange the spell chosen for this ability for a new one. He returns the previously chosen spell to his list of spells known and regains both lost spell slots. He then chooses a new spell, subject to the limitations given above. He loses that spell from his spells known list along with one spell slot of the newly chosen spell's level and a spell slot one level higher than the chosen spell.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.107
Bonus Spells Known		KEY:Dragonblood Sorcerer ~ Bonus Spells Known	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Dragonblood Sorcerer Class Feature.SpecialQuality								DESC:A dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 7th-level racial substitution level adds four spells to his list of known sorcerer spells. The spells added depend on the dragonblood sorcerer's alignment or draconic heritage. A dragonblood sorcerer who is good-aligned must choose the good list of known spells, and vice versa. One descended from a particular kind of dragon is treated as if he shared that dragon's alignment for the purpose of this substitution feature, regardless of his own alignment. For example, a half-red dragon sorcerer, or a sorcerer with Draconic Heritage (red dragon), is treated as evil-aligned for determining which bonus spells known he gains. Dragonblood sorcerers who are neither good nor evil and have no distinct draconic heritage can choose which set of spells to add. If a dragonblood sorcerer already knows any of the listed spells, he can pick another spell that a sorcerer would ordinarily have available at that same level. Evil: 1st-charm person; 2nd-darkness, resist energy; 3rd-suggestion. Good: 1st-bless; 2nd-fog cloud, resist energy; 3rd-fly. The chosen list of spells known replaces the normal additions to the sorcerer's list of spells known (one 1st-level spell, one 2nd-level spell, one 3rd-level spell) gained at 7th level.

# Dragonborn Paladin
Detect Dragonblood		KEY:Dragonborn Paladin ~ Detect Dragonblood	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Dragonborn Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A 1st-level dragonborn paladin can use detect dragonblood at will. This is a divination effect similar to a detect evil spell, except that it detects dragonblood creatures of any alignment. A dragonborn paladin can scan a 60-degree arc each round. By concentrating for 1 round, she knows if any dragonblood creatures are within the arc; concentrating for 2 rounds reveals the exact number of such creatures; and concentrating for 3 rounds reveals their exact locations. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin's detect evil class feature.																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.108
Bahamut's Blessing		KEY:Dragonborn Paladin ~ Bahamut's Blessing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Dragonborn Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality						DESC:At 4th level, a dragonborn paladin who uses her smite evil ability against evil dragons and dragonbloods gains an additional +2 bonus on the attack roll. She also deals 1 extra point of damage per two paladin levels. For example, a 13th-level dragonborn paladin with a 20 Strength and armed with a +2 longsword deals 1d8+26 points of damage when using smite evil against an evil dragonblood (+13 from normal smite evil, +6 from Bahamut's blessing, + 5 from Str, and +2 from the longsword).

This substitution feature replaces the improvement in base attack bonus normally gained by a 5th-level paladin. From 5th level on, a dragonborn paladin's base attack bonus is 1 lower than that of a standard paladin of her level.

He gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the following weapons: longspear, shortspear, and spear. At the DM's option, this bonus might also apply to other spearlike weapons. This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but it is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and anything else that requires that feat. A kobold fighter who has this ability could take Weapon Specialization (spear) without selecting Weapon Focus (spear) as a separate feat. This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter's 1st-level bonus feat and medium armor proficiency.

If a kobold ranger selects fey, humanoid (dwarf), or humanoid (gnome) as her favored enemy, she gains a +3 bonus against the chosen creature type instead of the standard +2. Bonuses against such creatures also increase by 3 every time the kobold ranger gains a new favored enemy, instead of the standard +2 increase.

This ability functions like the druid's animal companion ability, treating the kobold ranger's effective druid level as half her ranger level, instead of half her ranger level -3. A kobold ranger cannot select from an alternative list of animal companions; she is restricted to choosing a dire weasel as her animal companion.

This is the same as the rogue's trap sense class feature, except that the bonus granted on Reflex saves and to AC is +2 instead of +1. A kobold rogue's trap sense continues to improve at the normal rate (to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 9th, and so on). This extra bonus is lost, reducing the kobold rogue's trap sense bonus to the normal rogue value if the kobold rogue does not have a number of ranks in Craft (trapmaking) equal to or greater than her rogue class level.

A kobold rogue who succeeds on a Reflex save against a spell or effect gains the normal benefit for the successful save, and she can choose to move out of the area of the spell or effect. She must take the shortest path available to her, and she can't move farther than her speed. If more than one path of equal distance is available, she can choose which path to use. If no such path is available, the kobold rogue can't use this ability. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for movement. Example: A kobold rogue with a speed of 30 feet is within the area of a fireball spell. She successfully saves against the spell, so she takes no damage from the blast and can move out of the spell's area by the shortest route available.

Draconic Bardic Knowledge	KEY:Spellscale Bard ~ Draconic Bardic Knowledge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Spellscale Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A spellscale bard has special interest in events, items, and individuals important to dragons. Upon taking the 1st-level racial substitution level, a spellscale bard's keen interest in dragon lore grants him a +5 competence bonus on any bardic knowledge check related to dragons, so long as he maintains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level.

Inspire Arcana			KEY:Spellscale Bard ~ Inspire Arcana		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Spellscale Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a spellscale bard can spend one daily use of bardic music to make a single allied arcane spellcaster more powerful. To use this ability, a spellscale bard must have 3 or more ranks in Perform and a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level. The ally must be within 30 feet of and able to see and hear the spellscale bard, and the bard must be able to see the ally. As long as the chosen arcane spellcaster continues to hear the bard's performance, she casts her arcane spells with a +1 bonus to her caster level. The effect lasts as long as the spellscale bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire arcana upon himself. Inspire arcana is a mindaffecting ability. This substitution feature replaces the standard bard's inspire competence class feature.

Superior Suggestion		KEY:Spellscale Bard ~ Superior Suggestion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Class Feature.Spellscale Bard Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A spellscale bard who takes the 6th-level racial substitution level draws on his knowledge of his sorcerous ancestors to enhance his suggestion ability. So long as he maintains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level, a spellscale bard gains a +2 bonus on the save DC whenever he uses his suggestion bardic music ability. This substitution feature augments the standard bard's suggestion class feature, and it replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard bard at 6th level. From 6th level on, a spellscale bard who takes this substitution level can cast one less 2nd-level spell per day than shown on Table 3-4 (PH 27).
