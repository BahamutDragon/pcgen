DESC:You can apply a selected metamagic feat to your spells more quickly than normal.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.98																																																																																															BENEFIT:Choose a metamagic feat you know. You can apply the selected metamagic feat to any spontaneously cast spell without increasing the casting time. Normal: Without this feat, metamagic spells with a normal casting time of 1 standard action take a full-round action for spontaneous casters. Metamagic spells with a casting time of longer than 1 standard action take spontaneous casters an extra full-round action to cast. Special: You can gain Accelerate Metamagic multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new metamagic feat.

SOURCEPAGE:p.98																																																																																															BENEFIT:You have a tail that you can use to make a secondary natural attack in combat. This attack deals bludgeoning damage according to your size, as shown on the table below. If you already have a tail slap attack when you take this feat, use the value from the table or your existing damage value, whichever is greater. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation.
Dragon Trainer		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																			PRELANG:1,Draconic																															PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood	PRESKILL:1,Handle Animal=4																			PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, Handle Animal 4 ranks, Speak Language (Draconic).																				DESC:Your draconic nature gives you special insight into training dragons and draconic creatures.																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.98																																																																																															BENEFIT:You can use your Handle Animal skill to handle and train dragons with Intelligence scores of 6 or lower as if they were animals. You can also handle, train, and rear animals with the draconic template as if they were animals (rather than magical beasts). Even with this feat, dragons can't be reared with the Handle Animal skill. (For information on rearing dragons, see page 13 of Draconomicon.) Normal: Without this feat, only animals and magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 can be handled and trained with the Handle Animal skill, and using Handle Animal on a magical beast is done with a -4 penalty on the check.
Dragon Wings		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.FirstLevel																													PREMULT:1,[PREPCLEVEL:MAX=1],[PREVARLT:FirstLevelFeatTaken,FirstLevelFeatAllowed],[PREMULT:2,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Dragonwrought],[!PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,%]]	PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood																								PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, 1st level only.

In addition, you can use your wings to glide, negating damage from a fall from any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. You glide at a speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Even if your maneuverability improves, you can't hover while gliding. You can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If you become unconscious or helpless while in midair, your wings naturally unfurl, and powerful ligaments stiffen them. You descend in a tight corkscrew and take only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation. A kobold with the Dragonwrought feat can take this feat at 3rd level.
Dragonwrought		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.FirstLevel																																																				PRERACE:1,Kobold%																														PRETEXT:Kobold, 1st level only.															PREVARLT:FirstLevelFeatTaken,FirstLevelFeatAllowed					DESC:You were born a dragonwrought kobold, proof of your race's innate connection to dragons.											TEMPLATE:Dragonwrought																															SOURCEPAGE:p.100																																																																																															BENEFIT:You are a dragon wrought kobold. Your type is dragon rather than humanoid, and you lose the dragonblood subtype. You retain all your other subtypes and your kobold racial traits. Your scales become tinted with a color that matches that of your draconic heritage. As a dragon, you are immune to magic sleep and paralysis effects. You have darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. You gain a +2 racial bonus on the skill indicated for your draconic heritage on the table on page 103. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation. Having this feat allows you to take the Dragon Wings feat at 3rd level.
Extraordinary Trapsmith	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																														PRESKILL:1,Craft (Trapmaking)=9																		PRETEXT:Craft (trapmaking) 9 ranks.																												DESC:You are an expert at constructing mechanical traps.																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.100																																																																																															BENEFIT:When you determine the cost of raw materials and the time required to create a mechanical trap, reduce the base price by 25%%. Special: A kobold who selects this feat can instead reduce the base price by 50%% for determining raw materials and time required to create a mechanical trap.
Heavyweight Wings		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General														PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Reinforced Wings								PREMOVE:1,Glide=1,Fly=1																																																PRESTAT:1,STR=15						PRETEXT:Str 15, Reinforced Wings, wings and a glide or fly speed.

You can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. You can safely fly for a number of consecutive rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). You can exert yourself to fly for up to twice as long, but then you're fatigued at the end of the flight. You are likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because you can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, you can remain aloft for extended periods, even if you can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued. When you reach 12 HD, you have enough stamina and prowess to fly for longer periods. You can fly at a speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires no more exertion than walking or running. You can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but you must fly a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. You can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. You can use the run action while flying, provided you fly in a straight line.

You also gain a +4 bonus on the following checks and saves: Swim checks made to resist nonlethal damage, Fortitude saves made to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments, Fortitude saves made to resist damage from suffocation, and grapple checks made to escape a grapple or pin. Also, you can sleep in medium armor without becoming fatigued. Normal: A character without this feat who sleeps in medium armor is automatically fatigued the next day. Special: A kobold who would gain Endurance as a bonus feat can choose Kobold Endurance in its place. Kobold Endurance counts as the Endurance feat for the purpose of meeting a prerequisite for a feat, prestige class, or special ability.
Kobold Foe Strike		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Fighter																																																				PRERACE:1,Kobold%																														PRETEXT:Kobold.																															DESC:You are more effective in combat against your racial enemies.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	ASPECT:CombatBonus|When you hit a dwarf, fey, or gnome with a melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage if you flank the creature, or if it is flat-footed.																																																																			BENEFIT:When you hit a dwarf, fey, or gnome with a melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage if you flank the creature, or if it is flat-footed. Creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks are not subject to this extra damage. Any creature with concealment is immune to this extra damage. Special: A kobold fighter can select Kobold Foe Strike as one of his fighter bonus feats.

DESC:You can apply a selected metamagic feat to your spells more easily.					STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:ABILITY|FEAT|PC,TYPE=Metamagic																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.101																																																																																															BENEFIT:Choose a metamagic feat you know. When applying the chosen metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell, the spell uses a spell slot one level lower than normal for the applied metamagic feat, to a minimum of one level higher than a spell's normal level. For example, if you select Practical Metamagic (Empower Spell), you can apply the Empower Spell feat to any spell by using a spell slot one level higher rather than two. Special: You can gain Practical Metamagic multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new metamagic feat.
Reinforced Wings		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																										PREMOVE:1,Glide=1,Fly=1																																																PRESTAT:1,STR=13						PRETEXT:Str 13, wings and a glide or fly speed.

DESC:You can use two lower-level spell slots to cast a spell one level higher.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.101																																																																																															BENEFIT:You can use two spell slots of the same level to cast a spell you know that is one level higher.

DESC:You can apply draconic grafts to other living creatures or to yourself.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.101																																																																																															BENEFIT:You can create draconic grafts and apply them to other living creatures or to yourself. Creating a draconic graft takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its price. To create a graft, you must spend 1/25 of the graft's price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this price. Draconic grafts are described beginning on page 126.

Entangling Exhalation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Breath	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon											PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood				PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.																			DESC:You can use your breath weapon to create an entangling mesh of energy.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to enmesh all creatures in its area instead of producing its normal effect. Your breath weapon deals only half its normal damage; however, any creature that takes damage from your breath weapon becomes entangled and takes an extra 1d6 points of damage, of the same energy type as normally dealt by your breath weapon, each round at the start of your turn. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, creatures damaged by the initial breath are still entangled but don't take additional damage on later rounds.
Exhaled Barrier		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Breath	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon											PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood				PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.																			DESC:You can use your breath weapon to create a wall of energy.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.101	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to create a 10-foot-by-10-foot vertical plane of energy instead of producing its normal effect. The opaque wall's near endpoint begins at any corner of your space and extends in a straight line for 10 feet or until it contacts a solid surface. The wall lasts for 1d4 rounds. Any creature passing through the wall takes damage equal to that normally dealt by your breath weapon. If you create the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifier) halves this damage. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, the wall deals fire damage. If your breath weapon doesn't deal damage, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage.
Exhaled Immunity		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Breath	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,TYPE.Breath Weapon											PRERACE:1,RACETYPE=Dragon,RACESUBTYPE=Dragonblood				PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.

SOURCEPAGE:p.102	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, instead of producing its normal effect, you can choose to grant one willing creature adjacent to you immunity to the energy type of your breath weapon. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, this feat grants immunity to fire. This immunity lasts for 1d4 rounds. You can't use this feat on yourself.

PREWEAPONPROF:1,Bite							DESC:While raging, you can use your breath weapon to deal energy damage with your bite attacks.														SOURCEPAGE:p.102	BENEFIT:When you enter a rage or frenzy, you can channel one use of your breath weapon inward to add energy damage to your bite attacks. Activating this ability is a free action; the effect lasts until your rage ends or until you use your breath weapon again. While this feat is in effect, your bite attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of energy damage, matching the energy type of your breath weapon. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, this damage is fire damage.

Any creature in the area can make a Reflex save (DC 10 + level of the spell used + your Cha modifier) for half damage. This is a supernatural ability.

DESC:Casting the same spell several times in a row or at the same target enables you to perfect it.	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	BENEFIT:The Spell Rehearsal feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. You can only apply one maneuver at a time to a single spell. Persistence: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that allows affected creatures or objects a saving throw. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell, you add a cumulative +1 to the spell's save DC. If you cast any other spell after starting to use this feat or take any other standard action, the persistence chain breaks and you must begin anew. Refined Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that requires an attack roll to affect a target. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target, you gain a cumulative +2 enhancement bonus on the attack roll to deliver the spell. If you cast any spell that does not require an attack roll or take any other standard action, the refined targeting chain breaks and you must begin anew. Persistent Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that allows a target to apply spell resistance to the effect. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance.

Wing Buffet: To use this maneuver, you must charge an opponent. On the round after the charge, you can flutter your wings in a distracting manner while you make a melee attack or attacks against the same opponent you charged. If that opponent fails a DC 20 Reflex save, you gain a +2 bonus for your turn on your melee attack rolls against the distracted opponent. You cannot make a wing buffet again until after you make another charge. Wing Defense: To use this maneuver, you must have taken the total defense action. On the round after doing so, if you do not use your wings to fly, you can flutter your wings in such a way as to gain concealment for the round. Wing Fan: To use this maneuver, you must have used at least one move action in the previous round to fly or glide at least 30 feet. As a full-round action in the next round, you can use your wings to produce an effect identical to a gust of wind spell with a range of 30 feet. Using this maneuver makes you fatigued. You cannot use this maneuver if you are exhausted.
