Accelerate Metamagic	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:You can apply a selected metamagic feat to your spells more quickly than normal.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, Spellcraft 4 ranks, any metamagic feat, ability to spontaneously cast 1st-level spells.	BENEFIT:Choose a metamagic feat you know. You can apply the selected metamagic feat to any spontaneously cast spell without increasing the casting time. Normal: Without this feat, metamagic spells with a normal casting time of 1 standard action take a full-round action for spontaneous casters. Metamagic spells with a casting time of longer than 1 standard action take spontaneous casters an extra full-round action to cast. Special: You can gain Accelerate Metamagic multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new metamagic feat.	
Dragon Breath	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:You can use your breath weapon as often as a normal dragon.	PRETEXT:Half-dragon, 6 HD, breath weapon.	BENEFIT:You can use your breath weapon every 1d4 rounds. Normal: A half-dragon's breath weapon can only be used once per day.	
Dragon Tail	TYPE:General.FirstLevel	SOURCEPAGE:p.98		DESC:Your draconic ancestry manifests as a muscular tail you can use in combat.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, 1st level only.	BENEFIT:You have a tail that you can use to make a secondary natural attack in combat. This attack deals bludgeoning damage according to your size, as shown on the table below. If you already have a tail slap attack when you take this feat, use the value from the table or your existing damage value, whichever is greater. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation.
Dragon Trainer	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:Your draconic nature gives you special insight into training dragons and draconic creatures.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, Handle Animal 4 ranks, Speak Language (Draconic).	BENEFIT:You can use your Handle Animal skill to handle and train dragons with Intelligence scores of 6 or lower as if they were animals. You can also handle, train, and rear animals with the draconic template as if they were animals (rather than magical beasts). Even with this feat, dragons can't be reared with the Handle Animal skill. (For information on rearing dragons, see page 13 of Draconomicon.) Normal: Without this feat, only animals and magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 can be handled and trained with the Handle Animal skill, and using Handle Animal on a magical beast is done with a -4 penalty on the check.	
Dragon Wings	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:Your draconic ancestry manifests as a pair of wings that aid your jumps and allow you to glide.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, 1st level only.	BENEFIT:You have wings that aid your jumps, granting a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks. In addition, you can use your wings to glide, negating damage from a fall from any height and allowing 20 feet of forward travel for every 5 feet of descent. You glide at a speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. Even if your maneuverability improves, you can't hover while gliding. You can't glide while carrying a medium or heavy load. If you become unconscious or helpless while in midair, your wings naturally unfurl, and powerful ligaments stiffen them. You descend in a tight corkscrew and take only 1d6 points of falling damage, no matter what the actual distance of the fall. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation. A kobold with the Dragonwrought feat can take this feat at 3rd level.	
Dragonwrought	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:You were born a dragonwrought kobold, proof of your race's innate connection to dragons.	PRETEXT:Kobold, 1st level only.	BENEFIT:You are a dragon wrought kobold. Your type is dragon rather than humanoid, and you lose the dragonblood subtype. You retain all your other subtypes and your kobold racial traits. Your scales become tinted with a color that matches that of your draconic heritage. As a dragon, you are immune to magic sleep and paralysis effects. You have darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. You gain a +2 racial bonus on the skill indicated for your draconic heritage on the table on page 103. Special: Unlike most feats, this feat must be taken at 1st level, during character creation. Having this feat allows you to take the Dragon Wings feat at 3rd level.	TEMPLATE:Dragonwrought
Extraordinary Trapsmith	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:You are an expert at constructing mechanical traps.	PRETEXT:Craft (trapmaking) 9 ranks.	BENEFIT:When you determine the cost of raw materials and the time required to create a mechanical trap, reduce the base price by 25%%. Special: A kobold who selects this feat can instead reduce the base price by 50%% for determining raw materials and time required to create a mechanical trap.	
Heavyweight Wings	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:Your superior strength allows you to fly while heavily burdened.	PRETEXT:Str 15, Reinforced Wings, wings and a glide or fly speed.	BENEFIT:You can fly with heavy armor or a heavy load. Your speed is still reduced by encumbrance due to armor or total weight. Normal: Flying creatures can't fly in heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.	
Improved Dragon Wings	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.100	DESC:Your draconic wings now grant you flight.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, Dragon Wings, 6 HD.	BENEFIT:You can fly at a speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). You can't fly while carrying a medium or heavy load or while fatigued or exhausted. You can safely fly for a number of consecutive rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). You can exert yourself to fly for up to twice as long, but then you're fatigued at the end of the flight. You are likewise fatigued after spending a total of more than 10 minutes per day flying. Because you can glide before, after, and between rounds of actual flight, you can remain aloft for extended periods, even if you can only use flight for 1 round at a time without becoming fatigued. When you reach 12 HD, you have enough stamina and prowess to fly for longer periods. You can fly at a speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability), and flying requires no more exertion than walking or running. You can make a dive attack. A dive attack works like a charge, but you must fly a minimum of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. You can make a dive attack only when wielding a piercing weapon; if the attack hits, it deals double damage. You can use the run action while flying, provided you fly in a straight line.	
Kobold Endurance	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:Thanks to your race's determination, you are capable of amazing feats of strength and stamina.	PRETEXT:Kobold.	BENEFIT:You gain a +4 bonus on all Strength and Constitution ability checks, but not on Strength- or Constitution-based skill checks. You also gain a +4 bonus on the following checks and saves: Swim checks made to resist nonlethal damage, Fortitude saves made to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments, Fortitude saves made to resist damage from suffocation, and grapple checks made to escape a grapple or pin. Also, you can sleep in medium armor without becoming fatigued. Normal: A character without this feat who sleeps in medium armor is automatically fatigued the next day. Special: A kobold who would gain Endurance as a bonus feat can choose Kobold Endurance in its place. Kobold Endurance counts as the Endurance feat for the purpose of meeting a prerequisite for a feat, prestige class, or special ability.	
Kobold Foe Strike	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You are more effective in combat against your racial enemies.	PRETEXT:Kobold.	BENEFIT:When you hit a dwarf, fey, or gnome with a melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage if you flank the creature, or if it is flat-footed. Creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks are not subject to this extra damage. Any creature with concealment is immune to this extra damage. Special: A kobold fighter can select Kobold Foe Strike as one of his fighter bonus feats.	
Practical Metamagic	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You can apply a selected metamagic feat to your spells more easily.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, Spellcraft 8 ranks, any metamagic feat, ability to spontaneously cast 3rd-level spells.	BENEFIT:Choose a metamagic feat you know. When applying the chosen metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell, the spell uses a spell slot one level lower than normal for the applied metamagic feat, to a minimum of one level higher than a spell's normal level. For example, if you select Practical Metamagic (Empower Spell), you can apply the Empower Spell feat to any spell by using a spell slot one level higher rather than two. Special: You can gain Practical Metamagic multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new metamagic feat.	
Reinforced Wings	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You have strengthened the muscles of your wings.	PRETEXT:Str 13, wings and a glide or fly speed.	BENEFIT:You can fly in medium armor or with a medium load. Your speed is still reduced by encumbrance due to armor or total weight. Normal: Flying creatures can't fly in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.	
Versatile Spellcaster	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You can use two lower-level spell slots to cast a spell one level higher.	PRETEXT:Ability to spontaneously cast spells.	BENEFIT:You can use two spell slots of the same level to cast a spell you know that is one level higher. For example, a sorcerer with this feat can expend two 2nd-level spell slots to cast any 3rd-level spell he knows.	
Wyrmgrafter	TYPE:Item Creation	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You can apply draconic grafts to other living creatures or to yourself.	PRETEXT:Heal 10 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.	BENEFIT:You can create draconic grafts and apply them to other living creatures or to yourself. Creating a draconic graft takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its price. To create a graft, you must spend 1/25 of the graft's price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this price. Draconic grafts are described beginning on page 126.

###Block:	Breath Channeling					
Entangling Exhalation	TYPE:Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You can use your breath weapon to create an entangling mesh of energy.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to enmesh all creatures in its area instead of producing its normal effect. Your breath weapon deals only half its normal damage; however, any creature that takes damage from your breath weapon becomes entangled and takes an extra 1d6 points of damage, of the same energy type as normally dealt by your breath weapon, each round at the start of your turn. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, creatures damaged by the initial breath are still entangled but don't take additional damage on later rounds.	
Exhaled Barrier	TYPE:Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:You can use your breath weapon to create a wall of energy.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to create a 10-foot-by-10-foot vertical plane of energy instead of producing its normal effect. The opaque wall's near endpoint begins at any corner of your space and extends in a straight line for 10 feet or until it contacts a solid surface. The wall lasts for 1d4 rounds. Any creature passing through the wall takes damage equal to that normally dealt by your breath weapon. If you create the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Con modifier) halves this damage. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, the wall deals fire damage. If your breath weapon doesn't deal damage, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage.	
Exhaled Immunity	TYPE:Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:You can use your breath weapon to grant a willing creature immunity to energy.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon.	BENEFIT:When you use your breath weapon, instead of producing its normal effect, you can choose to grant one willing creature adjacent to you immunity to the energy type of your breath weapon. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, this feat grants immunity to fire. This immunity lasts for 1d4 rounds. You can't use this feat on yourself.	
Extra Exhalation	TYPE:Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:You can use your breath weapon one more time per day than normal.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, breath weapon with limited uses per day.	BENEFIT:You can use your breath weapon one additional time per day. The interval you must wait between breaths is 1d4 rounds. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you can breathe one additional time per day.	
Furious Inhalation	TYPE:Breath	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:While raging, you can use your breath weapon to deal energy damage with your bite attacks.	PRETEXT:Dragonblood subtype, Con 13, ability to rage or frenzy, bite attack, breath weapon.	BENEFIT:When you enter a rage or frenzy, you can channel one use of your breath weapon inward to add energy damage to your bite attacks. Activating this ability is a free action; the effect lasts until your rage ends or until you use your breath weapon again. While this feat is in effect, your bite attacks deal an extra 2d6 points of energy damage, matching the energy type of your breath weapon. If your breath weapon doesn't deal energy damage, this damage is fire damage.	

###Block: Draconic Feats						
Draconic Arcane Grace	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:You can convert some of your arcane spell energy into a saving throw bonus.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:As an immediate action (see page 122), you can give up an arcane spell slot to gain a bonus on all saving throws until the start of your next turn. The bonus equals the level of the spell slot used. You can declare that you are using this ability after you have rolled a save, but you must do so before the DM reveals whether the saving throw succeeded or failed.	
Draconic Breath	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:You can convert some of your arcane spell energy into a breath weapon.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can convert an arcane spell slot into a breath weapon. The breath weapon is a 30- foot cone (cold or fire) or a 60-foot line (acid or electricity) that deals 2d6 points of damage per level of the spell slot you expended to create the effect. Any creature in the area can make a Reflex save (DC 10 + level of the spell used + your Cha modifier) for half damage. This is a supernatural ability. Special: If the breath weapon of your draconic forebears does not deal acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you choose from among the four energy types mentioned above.	
Draconic Claw	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:You develop natural weapons like those of your draconic ancestors.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:You gain a claw attack. You can make a natural attack with two claws, dealing damage based on your size as if you were truly a dragon (Small 1d4, Medium 1d6, Large 1d8). In any round when you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can make a single claw attack at your full attack bonus as a swift action (see page 122) against an opponent you threaten.	
Draconic Flight	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:The secret of draconic flight has been revealed to you, granting you the ability to fly occasionally.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.

Draconic Heritage	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:You have a greater connection with your draconic bloodline than others of your kind.	PRETEXT:Sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:You gain the dragonblood subtype. Choose one kind of dragon from the list in the accompanying table. This is your draconic heritage, which can only be changed by undergoing the Rite of Draconic Affinity (see page 59). Half-dragons must choose the same dragon kind as their dragon parent. When you declare your draconic heritage, you gain the skill indicated on the table as a sorcerer class skill. In addition, you gain a bonus equal to the number of draconic feats you have on saving throws against magic sleep and paralysis effects, as well as on saves against spells and abilities with a descriptor that matches the corresponding entry in the accompanying table. Special: With your DM's permission, you can choose a draconic heritage associated with a kind of dragon not found in the Monster Manual. See below for details.	
Draconic Legacy	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:You have realized greater arcane power through your draconic heritage.	PRETEXT:Any four draconic feats.	BENEFIT:Based on your draconic heritage, add the spells noted on the accompanying table to your list of spells known. Each spell is added at the spell level where a spellcaster normally gains it unless otherwise indicated. Special: With your DM's permission, you can choose a draconic legacy associated with a kind of dragon not found in the Monster Manual. See the table on page 103 for details.	
Draconic Persuasion	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:Your arcane talents lend you a great deal of allure.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:After you cast an arcane spell, you gain a bonus equal to 1-1/2 times the spell's level on your next Bluff, Intimidate, or Perform check. The check must be made before the end of the next round.	
Draconic Power	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:You have greater power when manipulating the energies of your heritage.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:Your caster level increases by one, and you add 1 to the save DC of all arcane spells with the descriptor or subschool associated with your draconic heritage. Special: This feat works in conjunction with the Energy Substitution feat (Complete Arcane, page 79) as long as the substituted energy matches the energy type associated with your draconic heritage.	
Draconic Presence	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.104	DESC:When you use your magic, your mere presence can terrify those around you.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:Whenever you cast an arcane spell, opponents within 10 feet of and with fewer Hit Dice than you become shaken for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell you cast. A Will save (DC 10 + level of the spell cast + your Cha modifier) negates the effect. A successful save indicates that the Many family trees include dragon blood opponent is immune to your draconic presence for 24 hours. This ability does not affect creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or creatures that are already shaken, nor does it have any effect on dragons.	
Draconic Reservoir	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:Errata	DESC:You can cast your 1st-level sorcerer spell-like ability gained from Draconic Rite of Passage 3/day.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage	BENEFIT:You can cast your 1st-level sorcerer spell-like ability gained from Draconic Rite of Passage 3/day. 
Draconic Resistance	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:Your bloodline hardens your body against effects related to the nature of your progenitor.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:You gain resistance to the energy type associated with your draconic heritage equal to three times the number of draconic feats you have, including draconic feats you take after gaining this feat. Special: This feat grants no benefit to a character whose draconic heritage is not associated with an energy type, such as a sorcerer with pan lung heritage.	
Draconic Skin	TYPE:Draconic	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:Your skin takes on a sheen, luster, and hardness related to your draconic ancestor.	PRETEXT:Draconic Heritage, sorcerer level 1st.	BENEFIT:Your natural armor bonus increases by 1.

###Block: Tactical 						
Spell Rehearsal	TYPE:Tactical	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:Casting the same spell several times in a row or at the same target enables you to perfect it.	PRETEXT:Caster level 1st.	BENEFIT:The Spell Rehearsal feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. You can only apply one maneuver at a time to a single spell. Persistence: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that allows affected creatures or objects a saving throw. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell, you add a cumulative +1 to the spell's save DC. If you cast any other spell after starting to use this feat or take any other standard action, the persistence chain breaks and you must begin anew. Refined Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that requires an attack roll to affect a target. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target, you gain a cumulative +2 enhancement bonus on the attack roll to deliver the spell. If you cast any spell that does not require an attack roll or take any other standard action, the refined targeting chain breaks and you must begin anew. Persistent Targeting: To use this maneuver, you must cast a specific spell two or more times in succession, and the spell must be one that allows a target to apply spell resistance to the effect. You can take a move action after casting the spell once before casting it again, but you cannot take any other standard actions between successive castings. On the second and subsequent times you cast the spell at the same target, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance. If you cast any other spell or take any other standard action, the persistent targeting chain breaks and you must begin anew. Special: This benefit applies to spells you know or have prepared as well as spells cast from items such as wands and scrolls.	
Wing Expert	TYPE:Tactical	SOURCEPAGE:p.105	DESC:You can use your wings to create a variety of effects.	PRETEXT:Flyby Attack, wings and a glide or fly speed.	BENEFIT:The Wing Expert feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers. Wing Buffet: To use this maneuver, you must charge an opponent. On the round after the charge, you can flutter your wings in a distracting manner while you make a melee attack or attacks against the same opponent you charged. If that opponent fails a DC 20 Reflex save, you gain a +2 bonus for your turn on your melee attack rolls against the distracted opponent. You cannot make a wing buffet again until after you make another charge. Wing Defense: To use this maneuver, you must have taken the total defense action. On the round after doing so, if you do not use your wings to fly, you can flutter your wings in such a way as to gain concealment for the round. Wing Fan: To use this maneuver, you must have used at least one move action in the previous round to fly or glide at least 30 feet. As a full-round action in the next round, you can use your wings to produce an effect identical to a gust of wind spell with a range of 30 feet. Using this maneuver makes you fatigued. You cannot use this maneuver if you are exhausted.
