###Block: Spell Descriptions - Short and Long
# Spell Name				Description
Clenched Fist.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like interposing hand, except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours. The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier [for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively], +11 for the hand's Strength score [33], -1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save [against this spell's save DC] or be stunned for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The clenched fist can also interpose itself as interposing hand does, or it can bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +15 bonus on the Strength check. Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities. Arcane Focus: A leather glove.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Clenched Fist.MOD				DESC:Large hand provides cover, pushes, or attacks your foes.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crushing Hand.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like interposing hand, except that the hand can interpose itself, push, or crush one opponent that you select. The crushing hand can grapple an opponent like grasping hand does. Its grapple bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier [for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively], +12 for the hand's Strength score [35], +4 for being Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage [lethal, not nonlethal] on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The crushing hand can also interpose itself as interposing hand does, or it can bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +18 bonus. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities. Arcane Material Component: The shell of an egg. Arcane Focus: A glove of snakeskin.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Crushing Hand.MOD				DESC:Large hand provides cover, pushes, or crushes your foes.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Forceful Hand.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like interposing hand, except that the forceful hand pursues and pushes away the opponent that you designate. Treat this attack as a bull rush with a +14 bonus on the Strength check [+8 for Strength 27, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets]. The hand always moves with the opponent to push that target back the full distance allowed, and it has no speed limit. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. A very strong creature could not push the hand out of its way because the latter would instantly reposition itself between the creature and you, but an opponent could push the hand up against you by successfully bull rushing it. Focus: A sturdy glove made of leather or heavy cloth.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Forceful Hand.MOD				DESC:Hand pushes creatures away.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Grasping Hand.MOD				DESC:This spell functions like interposing hand, except the hand can also grapple one opponent that you select. The grasping hand gets one grapple attack per round. Its attack bonus to make contact equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier [for wizards, clerics, and sorcerers, respectively], +10 for the hand's Strength score [31], -1 for being Large. Its grapple bonus is this same figure, except with a +4 modifier for being Large instead of -1. The hand holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The grasping hand can also bull rush an opponent as forceful hand does, but at a +16 bonus on the Strength check [+10 for Strength 35, +4 for being Large, and a +2 bonus for charging, which it always gets], or interpose itself as interposing hand does. Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities. Arcane Focus: A leather glove.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Grasping Hand.MOD				DESC:Hand provides cover, pushes, or grapples.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Interposing Hand.MOD			DESC:Interposing hand creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover [+4 AC] for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however. An interposing hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and its AC is 20 [-1 size, +11 natural]. It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it. The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field, but it suffers the full effect of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys it. Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. Focus: A soft glove.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Interposing Hand.MOD			DESC:Hand provides cover against one opponent.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Instant Summons.MOD			DESC:You call some nonliving item from virtually any location directly to your hand. First, you must place your arcane mark on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word [set by you when the spell is cast] and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way. If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurs. The inscription on the gem is invisible. It is also unreadable, except by means of a read magic spell, to anyone but you. The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it. Material Component: A sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Instant Summons.MOD			DESC:Prepared object appears in your hand.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Black Tentacles.MOD			DESC:This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot-including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength. Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage. Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes. Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren't grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed. Material Component: A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Black Tentacles.MOD			DESC:Tentacles grapple all within 15 ft. spread.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secret Chest.MOD				DESC:You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as sixty days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level [regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet]. If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75%% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating [a standard action], and it appears next to you. The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica [of the same materials and perfect in every detail], so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. [The replica costs 50 gp.] You can have but one pair of these chests at any given time-even a wish spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be. to hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative chance of 5%% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even with a wish spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it. Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive. Focus: The chest and its replica.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secret Chest.MOD				DESC:Hides expensive chest on Ethereal Plane; you retrieve it at will.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secure Shelter.MOD			DESC:You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace. The shelter has no heating or cooling source [other than natural insulation qualities]. Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise-it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles [but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants]. The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell. Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter. The secure shelter contains rude furnishings -eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk. Material Component: A square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood. These must be augmented by the components of the unseen servant spell [string and a bit of wood] if this benefit is to be included. Focus: The focus of the alarm spell [silver wire and a tiny bell] if this benefit is to be included.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Secure Shelter.MOD			DESC:Creates sturdy cottage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tiny Hut.MOD				DESC:You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends. The temperature inside the hut is 70? F if the exterior temperature is between 0? and 100? F. An exterior temperature below 0? or above 100? lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane [75+ mph wind speed] or greater force destroys it. The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut [they have total concealment]. Material Component: A small crystal bead that shatters when the spell duration expires or the hut is dispelled.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Tiny Hut.MOD				DESC:Creates shelter for ten creatures.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trap.MOD					DESC:This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100%% certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time. If another phantom trap is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails. Material Component: A piece of iron pyrite touched to the object to be trapped while the object is sprinkled with a special dust requiring 50 gp to prepare.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Trap.MOD					DESC:Makes item seem trapped.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Acid Arrow.MOD				DESC:A magical arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The arrow deals 2d4 points of acid damage with no splash damage. For every three caster levels [to a maximum of 18th], the acid, unless somehow neutralized, lasts for another round, dealing another 2d4 points of damage in that round. Material Component: Powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach. Focus: A dart.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Acid Arrow.MOD				DESC:Ranged touch attack; 2d4 damage for ((min(CASTERLEVEL,18)/3)+1) rounds.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Disjunction.MOD			DESC:All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components [ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does], and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher. You also have a 1%% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Even artifacts are subject to disjunction, though there is only a 1%% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. [These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish.] Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95%% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Disjunction.MOD			DESC:Dispels magic, disenchants magic items.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Faithful Hound.MOD		DESC:You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured [it does not move]. The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. [Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.] The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite [+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage] once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an invisible creature. The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of damage reduction. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled. The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends. Material Component: A tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Faithful Hound.MOD		DESC:Phantom dog can guard, attack.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Lucubration.MOD			DESC:You instantly recall any one spell of 5th level or lower that you have used during the past 24 hours. The spell must have been actually cast during that period. The recalled spell is stored in your mind as through prepared in the normal fashion. If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. The recovered spell is not usable until the material components are available.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Lucubration.MOD			DESC:Wizard only. Recalls spell of 5th level or lower.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Magnificent Mansion.MOD	DESC:You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants [as many as two per caster level], liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as unseen servant spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion. Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. Focus: A miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon [each item worth 5 gp].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Magnificent Mansion.MOD	DESC:Door leads to extradimensional mansion.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Private Sanctum.MOD		DESC:This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally. Divination [scrying] spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to detect thoughts. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside [because it blocks sound], but it does not prevent other communication, such as a sending or message spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar. The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area. Mage's private sanctum can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Private Sanctum.MOD		DESC:Prevents anyone from viewing or scrying an area for 24 hours.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Sword.MOD				DESC:This spell brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Int bonus or your Cha bonus [for wizards or sorcerers, respectively] with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19-20 and a critical multiplier of x2. The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers. Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target. The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The sword's AC is 13 [10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus]. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time Mage's sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. Focus: A miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc. It costs 250 gp to construct.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mage's Sword.MOD				DESC:Floating magic blade strikes opponents.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Aura.MOD				DESC:You alter an item's aura so that it registers to detect spells [and spells with similar capabilities] as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify.  If the object bearing magic aura has identify cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is. If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful [if it is an artifact, for instance], magic aura doesn't work. Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura. Focus: A small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Magic Aura.MOD				DESC:Alters object's magic aura.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Freezing Sphere.MOD			DESC:Freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 15d6] to each creature in the area. An elemental [water] creature instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level [maximum 15d8]. If the freezing sphere strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water [not including water-based creatures], it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet [a 10- foot square] per caster level [maximum 1,500 square feet]. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so. You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the freezing sphere bursts centered on you [and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect]. Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action. Focus: A small crystal sphere.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Freezing Sphere.MOD			DESC:Freezes water or deals cold damage.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resilient Sphere.MOD			DESC:A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, a disintegrate spell, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. Material Component: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Resilient Sphere.MOD			DESC:Force globe protects but traps one subject.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telekinetic Sphere.MOD			DESC:This spell functions like resilient sphere, with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within an telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range [100 feet + 10 feet per caster level] after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents. You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so [a standard action], you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round [if on a level surface] or descends at its falling rate [if aloft] until it reaches a level surface, or the spell's duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating [voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check], you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration. The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere. You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it. Material Component: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic, and a pair of small bar magnets.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telekinetic Sphere.MOD			DESC:As resilient sphere, but you move sphere telekinetically.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Irresistible Dance.MOD			DESC:The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and a -10 penalty on Reflex saves, and it negates any AC bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Irresistible Dance.MOD			DESC:Forces subject to dance.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mnemonic Enhancer.MOD			DESC:Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast. Prepare: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally. Retain: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the mnemonic enhancer. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind. In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours [if not cast]. Material Component: A piece of string, and ink consisting of squid secretion with black dragon's blood. Focus: An ivory plaque of at least 50 gp value.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Mnemonic Enhancer.MOD			DESC:Wizard only. Prepares extra spells or retains one just cast.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telepathic Bond.MOD			DESC:You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance [although not from one plane to another]. If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting. Telepathic bond can be made permanent with a permanency spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency. Material Component: Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Telepathic Bond.MOD			DESC:Link lets allies communicate.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hideous Laughter.MOD			DESC:This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't "translate" well. Material Component: Tiny tarts that are thrown at the target and a feather that is waved in the air.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Hideous Laughter.MOD			DESC:Subject loses actions for (CASTERLEVEL) rounds.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Floating Disk.MOD				DESC:You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. [If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.] The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it. Material Component: A drop of mercury.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Floating Disk.MOD				DESC:Creates 3-ft.-diameter horizontal disk that holds (CASTERLEVEL*100) lbs|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Transformation.MOD			DESC:You become a virtual fighting machine- stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mind-set changes so that you relish combat and you can't cast spells, even from magic items. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, a +4 natural armor bonus to AC, a +5 competence bonus on Fortitude saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level [which may give you multiple attacks]. You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list. Material Component: A potion of bull's strength, which you drink [and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects].|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
