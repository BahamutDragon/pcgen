SOURCESHORT:PH		SOURCEPAGE:p.89	BENEFIT:In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit (see Concealment, page 152). An invisible attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible (see PH p.151). The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half (see PH p.163).
# DG - reduce the desc slightly.
#Normal: Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers trying to hit you (see Table 8-5: Attack Roll Modifiers, page 151) apply, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility (see Table 9-4: Hampered Movement, page 163) also applies.

Brewing a potion takes one day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a potion is its spell level ? its caster level ? 50 gp. to brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price. When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.

For example, a fighter with a Dexterity of 15 can make a total of three attacks of opportunity in 1 round-the one attack of opportunity any character is entitled to, plus two more because of his +2 Dexterity bonus. If four goblins move out of the character's threatened squares, he can make one attack of opportunity each against three of the four. You can still make only one attack of opportunity per opportunity. With this feat, you may also make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed. Normal: A character without this feat can make only one attack of opportunity per round and can't make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed. Special: The Combat Reflexes feat does not allow a rogue to use her opportunist ability (see page 51) more than once per round. A fighter may select Combat Reflexes as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38) A monk may select Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat at 2nd level.|PREVAREQ:DisplayFullFeat,1
