# Created January, 2015 Tom Parker
# This file represents a conversion mechanism for items that were previously
# stand-alone tokens, but are now handled internally as FACT or FACTSET.
#
# This file does not need to be referenced by a set of data or game mode
# unless that data uses a data control file (DATACONTROL: in a PCC file)
#
# Once a dataset takes on the responsibility of a DATACONTROL file, then it 
# MUST include these entries (or something near equivalent [additional
# SELECT-ability would be legal]) in one of the DATACONTROL files.
