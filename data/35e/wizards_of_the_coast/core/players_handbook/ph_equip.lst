The weight given applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor. While the gauntlet is locked, you can't use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.) Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.
#Shield Spikes																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.125																																SPROP:When added to your shield, these spikes turn it into a martial piercing weapon that increases the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you (from 1d4 to 1d6, for instance). You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack (see above). An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.

You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so because of the extra weight on your arm. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you don't get the buckler's AC bonus for the rest of the round. You can't bash someone with a buckler.

It includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. Several layers of mail are hung over vital areas.

The suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body, so full plate hampers movement less than splint mail even though splint is lighter. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 x 100) gold pieces. Full plate is also known as field plate.

#SPROP:A backpack is a leather pack carried on the back, typically with straps to secure it.
Bedroll									TYPE:Goods.General.Resizable														COST:0.1	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.126																											SPROP:You never know where you're going to sleep, and a bedroll helps you get better sleep in a hayloft or on the cold ground. A bedroll consists of bedding and a blanket thin enough to be rolled up and tied. In an emergency, it can double as a stretcher.
Blanket, Winter			KEY:Blanket (Winter)		TYPE:Goods.General.Resizable														COST:0.5	WT:3		SOURCEPAGE:p.126																											SPROP:A thick, quilted, wool blanket made to keep you warm in cold weather.
Caltrops									TYPE:Goods.General															COST:1	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.126																											SPROP:Covers 1 5 foot square. Caltrops attack anyone moving into or fighting in that square are attacked (BAB+0, bypassing shield, armor and deflection bonuses) for 1 point of damage and speed reduced by half for 24 hours. Any charging or running creature is stopped. Move at half speed to avoid caltrops.
#SPROP:A caltrop is a four-pronged iron spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square. Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. (Deflection averts blows as they approach, but it does not prevent a creature from touching something dangerous.) If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble. The DM judges the effectiveness of caltrops against unusual opponents. A Small monstrous centipede, for example, can slither through an area containing caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant wearing fire giant-sized boots is immune to normalsize caltrops. (They just get stuck in the soles of his boots.)

Crowbar									TYPE:Goods.General															COST:2	WT:5		SOURCEPAGE:p.126																											SPROP:This iron bar is made for levering closed items open. A crowbar is the perfect tool for prying open doors or chests, shattering chains, and the like, and it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made for such purposes. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon (see page 113) that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.

By knocking sparks into tinder, you can create a small flame. Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.
Grappling Hook								TYPE:Goods.General															COST:1	WT:4		SOURCEPAGE:p.126																											SPROP:When tied to the end of a rope, a grappling hook can secure the rope to a battlement, window ledge, tree limb, or other protrusion. Throwing a grappling hook successfully requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 per 10 feet of distance thrown).
Hammer									TYPE:Goods.General															COST:0.5	WT:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.126																											SPROP:This one-handed hammer with an iron head is useful for pounding pitons into a wall. If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon (see page 113) that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.

QUALITY:Shadowy Illumination|30 ft.	QUALITY:Duration|6 hr./pint			SPROP:A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. It burns with a more even flame than a torch, but, unlike a lantern, it uses an open flame and it can spill easily, a fact that makes it too dangerous for most adventuring. You can carry a lamp in one hand. See page 164 for more rules on illumination.

Acid			KEY:Acid (Flask)			TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:You can throw a flask of acid as a splash weapon (see Throw Splash Weapon, page 158). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Alchemist's Fire	KEY:Alchemist's Fire (Flask)	TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:Alchemist's fire is sticky, adhesive substance that ignites when exposed to air. You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon (see Throw Splash Weapon, page 158). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.																																																																																																																																			SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Antitoxin		KEY:Antitoxin (Vial)		TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:If you drink antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 1 hour.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Everburning Torch						TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:This otherwise normal torch has a continual flame spell cast upon it. An everburning torch clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius. See page 164 for more rules on illumination.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Holy Water		KEY:Holy Water (Flask)		TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:Damage undead or evil outsiders for 2d4. Throw as a splash weapon (P158) as ranged touch attack with range increment 10 feet. (Splash does 1pt damage to every undead/evil outsider adjacent to target).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
#SPROP:Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon (see Throw Splash Weapon, page 158). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash. Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit) because the clerics are happy to supply people with what they need to battle evil.
Smokestick							TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 10- foot cube (treat the effect as a fog cloud spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Sunrod							TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck. It clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless. See pages 164 for more rules on illumination.																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Tanglefoot Bag						TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.128	SPROP:This round leather bag is full of alchemical goo. When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater. A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent (see page 268 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.	SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Thunderstone						TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -4 penalty on initiative and has a 20%% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast. Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as AC 5; if you miss, see Throw Splash Weapon, page 158, to determine where the thunderstone lands.																																																																																																																																																								SORTKEY:SpecialSubstances
Tindertwig							TYPE:SpecialSubstances	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	SPROP:The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

SORTKEY:SpellCastingServices
Spell									TYPE:Spellcasting.Services	SOURCEPAGE:p.132	SPROP:The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his or her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell, such as into a dungeon to cast knock on a secret door that you can't open, you need to negotiate with him or her, and the default answer is no. The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or focus component and no XP cost. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell. If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell. If the spell has an XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost. For instance, to get a 9th-level cleric to cast commune for you, you need to pay 450 gp for a 5th-level spell at caster level 9th, plus 500 gp for the 100 XP loss that the caster suffers, plus 25 gp for the holy water, for a total of 975 gp. Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences (such as contact other plane), the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance (such as teleport), you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren't returning with the caster. In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2ndlevel spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells, so seeking out such a caster may become an adventure itself. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has more information on settlement sizes and demographics.) Because you must get an actual spellcaster to cast a spell for you and can't rely on a neutral broker, money is not always sufficient to get a spell cast. If the spellcaster is opposed to you on religious, moral, or political grounds, you may not be able to get the spell you want for any price. The DM always sets the final price of any spellcasting you want to purchase.	SORTKEY:SpellCastingServices
