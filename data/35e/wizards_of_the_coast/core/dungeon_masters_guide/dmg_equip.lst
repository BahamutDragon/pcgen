# Equipment Name		Unique Key				Required Weapon Proficiency		Type									Cost		Weight	Crit Mult	Crit Range	Damage	Modifier		Wield Category	Range		Size		Source Page		Special Property
Blowgun								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Blowgun		TYPE:Piercing.Weapon.Ranged					COST:1	WT:2		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1							RANGE:10			SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:This weapon is used to propel small needles a long distance. It is silent.
Needles, Blowgun (20)	KEY:Needles (Blowgun/20)							TYPE:Ammo.BlowgunAmmo						COST:1	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:These 2-inch-long iron needles are sold in small wooden cases of 20. A full case is so light that its weight is negligible.
Wakizashi								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sword (Short)	TYPE:Martial.Weapon.Light.Melee.Slashing			COST:0	WT:3		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d6	EQMOD:MWORKW								SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:This small, slightly curved short sword is made with a skill only masterful weaponsmiths possess. It counts as a masterwork weapon and grants its wielder a +1 bonus on attack rolls. A masterwork weapon's bonus on attack rolls does not stack with an enhancement bonus on attack rolls.
Kusari-Gama								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Kusari-Gama	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Martial.Light.Exotic.Slashing		COST:10			CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6											SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:This small sickle is attached to a length of chain. A kusari-gama is an exotic weapon that has reach. It can strike opponents 10 feet away. In addition, unlike other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe. It can be used in all respects like a spiked chain (see page 115 of the Player's Handbook) for trip attacks, disarming other foes, and using its wielder's Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier in attack rolls.
Katana								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Sword (Bastard)	TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Slashing.Exotic.Martial			COST:100	WT:6		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:2	DAMAGE:1d10	EQMOD:MWORKW	WIELD:TwoHanded					SOURCEPAGE:p.144	SPROP:While functionally a bastard sword, this sword is the most masterfully made nonmagical weapon in existence. It counts as a masterwork weapon and grants its wielder a +1 bonus on attack rolls. A katana is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium creature can use a katana two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. With Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Sword (Bastard)), a Medium creature can use it in one hand. A masterwork weapon's bonus on attack rolls does not stack with an enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

#Gunpowder	TYPE:Firearm.Gunpowder	COST:2		SOURCEPAGE:p.145	SPROP: While gunpowder burns (1 ounce consumes itself in 1 round and illuminates like a sunrod) or even explodes in the right conditions, it is chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a pistol or a rifle, or it is formed into a bomb (see below). An ounce of gunpowder is needed to propel a bullet. Gunpowder is sold in small kegs (15-pound capacity, 20 pounds total weight, 250 gp each) and in water-resistant powder horns (2-pound capacity and total weight, 35 gp for a full powder horn). If gunpowder gets wet, it cannot be used to fire a bullet.

# Equipment Name		Unique Key				Required Weapon Proficiency			Type										Weight	Crit Mult	Crit Range	Damage	Range		Source Page		Quality and value		Special Property
Pistol, Automatic		KEY:Pistol (Automatic)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Pistol (Automatic)	TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:3		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:2d6	RANGE:40	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:An automatic pistol can fire fifteen times before reloading and can be used to attack more than once per round if the user has the ability to make multiple attacks. Releasing an empty magazine and inserting a new one is a move action.
Pistol, Revolver		KEY:Pistol (Revolver)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Pistol (Revolver		TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:3		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:2d8	RANGE:30	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A revolver can fire six times before it needs reloading (which requires a full-round action).
Rifle, Hunting		KEY:Rifle (Hunting)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Rifle (Hunting)		TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:8		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:2d10	RANGE:80	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A hunting rifle can fire five times before it needs reloading (which requires a full-round action).
Rifle, Automatic		KEY:Rifle (Automatic)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Rifle (Automatic)	TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:8		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:2d8	RANGE:80	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:An automatic rifle can fire thirty times before it needs reloading. Releasing an empty magazine and inserting a new one is a move action. As an attack, an automatic rifle can instead spray a space 10 feet across with ten bullets. If the attacker succeeds on an attack roll against AC 10, everyone in that space must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take the weapon's damage.
Shotgun								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Shotgun			TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Piercing	WT:7		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:2d8	RANGE:30	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A shotgun is most effective at close range; on any successful attack, a -1 penalty is applied to the damage roll for each range increment of the attack. It can fire six times before it needs reloading (which requires a full-round action). The weapon uses shotgun shells, cylindrical cartridges that have a built-in firing cap at their base. They are packed with a mixture of gunpowder and small lead pellets.
Grenade Launcher							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Grenade Launcher		TYPE:ModernEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm			WT:7				CRITRANGE:1			RANGE:70	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	QUALITY:Era|Modern	SPROP:A grenade launcher can fire fragmentation or smoke grenades using its range increment, but must be reloaded each time it fires, requiring a standard action. A grenade launcher is a tube set on a metal tripod and equipped with a sighting mechanism. A single smoke grenade or fragmentation grenade easily slips into the tube.
# Explosives
Dynamite																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.146					SPROP:This short, thin cylinder of explosive material has a fuse that must be lit before it is thrown or set. Lighting a stick of dynamite is a move action, and the dynamite goes off in the same round or up to several minutes later (depending on how long the fuse is). The explosive has a blast radius of 5 feet and deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Anyone caught within the blast radius can make a DC 15 Reflex save to take half damage. It's possible to bind together several sticks of dynamite so they ignite and explode at the same time. Each additional stick increases the damage by 1d6 (maximum damage 10d6) and the burst radius by 5 feet (maximum burst radius 20 feet).
Grenade, Fragmentation	KEY:Grenade (Fragmentation)	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|NoProfReq																							SOURCEPAGE:p.146					SPROP:A fragmentation grenade looks like a large egg, sometimes mounted on a 1-foot-long stick with small fins. If thrown, it uses its range increment, but if launched from a grenade launcher, it uses that weapon's range increment. Fragmentation grenades are advanced antipersonnel explosives that deal slashing damage in a 20-foot radius. Anyone caught within the blast radius can make a DC 15 Reflex save to take half damage.
Grenade, Smoke		KEY:Grenade (Smoke)		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|NoProfReq																							SOURCEPAGE:p.146					SPROP:A smoke grenade looks like a squat cylinder, sometimes mounted on a 1-foot-long stick with small fins. If thrown, it uses its range increment, but if launched from a grenade launcher, it uses that weapon's range increment. One round after it lands or hits its target, this nondamaging explosive emits a cloud of smoke (as the fog cloud spell) in a 20-foot radius. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

Reloading the weapon is a move action.
Antimatter Rifle	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Antimatter Rifle	TYPE:FuturisticEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Futuristic				WT:10		SLOTS:2	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:6d8	WIELD:TwoHanded	RANGE:120	SOURCEPAGE:p.147			QUALITY:Era|Futuristic	SPROP:An antimatter rifle is a devastating short-range attack weapon that can be fired once per round. It holds an energy cell (weight 1 pound) that is depleted after two shots. Reloading the weapon is a move action.
Flamer		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Flamer		TYPE:FuturisticEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Futuristic.Fire			WT:8		SLOTS:2	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:3d6	WIELD:TwoHanded	RANGE:100	SOURCEPAGE:p.147			QUALITY:Era|Futuristic	SPROP:A flamer can be fired once per round. Unlike other ranged weapons, it deals damage to every square in a 5-foot-wide stream extending out to the flamer's maximum range (200 feet). It contains a fuel pack with enough concentrated flamer fuel for ten shots. Installing a new fuel pack requires a full-round action.
Laser Rifle		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Laser Rifle	TYPE:FuturisticEra.Weapon.Ranged.Projectile.Firearm.Futuristic				WT:7		SLOTS:2	CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:3d8	WIELD:TwoHanded	RANGE:100	SOURCEPAGE:p.147			QUALITY:Era|Futuristic	SPROP:A laser rifle fires thirty times before a new energy cell (weight 1 pound) needs to be reloaded and has a rate of fire equal to the attacker's number of attacks.

Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made against him be rerolled. He must take whatever consequences come from the second roll, since not all luck is good. The wearer's player must decide whether to have the attack roll rerolled before damage is rolled. Strong enchantment; CL 12th

When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score (see page 106). Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal (for example, more willing than normal to follow a leader into battle against dangerous foes). Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in any way and still have the effect function. Strong enchantment; CL 15th

It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of -2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor, weighs 20 pounds, and it allows the wearer to use fly on command (as the spell) once per day. Faint transmutation [good]; CL 5th

The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The "claws" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets. The armor bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn. Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th	AUTO:EQUIP|Demon Armor Claw Attack

Speed while wearing elven chain is 30 feet for Medium creatures, or 20 feet for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 20%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor check penalty of -2. It is considered light armor and weighs 20 pounds. No aura (nonmagical)

This +2 weapon becomes +4 against evil creatures, and against Negative Energy Plane or undead creatures it deals double damage (and *3 on a crit). Once per day, by swinging the blade vigorously above your head and speaking the command word, the sword sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. This starts at a 10-foot radiance +5ft/rnd for 10 rounds, staying at 60' globe of light until you stop swinging, whereupon it fades to a dim glow for 1 minute. The sword is good aligned, and any evil creature wielding it gains one negative level. (DMG P228) Moderate evocation; CL 10th
#SPROP:This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and *3 on a critical hit instead of the usual *2). The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The sunblade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded. Moderate evocation; CL 10th

Faint transmutation; CL 5th
Ring of Counterspells																									TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:4000	WT:0								SOURCEPAGE:p.230																																																				SPROP:This ring might seem to be a ring of spell storing upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed in it again. Moderate evocation; CL 11th
Ring of Djinni Calling																									TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:125000	WT:0								SOURCEPAGE:p.230																																																				SPROP:One of the many rings of fable, this "genie" ring is most useful indeed. It serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Elemental Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless. See the Monster Manual for details of a djinni's abilities. Strong conjuration; CL 17th
Ring of Elemental Command (Air)				KEY:Ring of Elemental Command (Air)				OUTPUTNAME:Ring of Elemental Command (Air)			TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:200000	WT:0								SOURCEPAGE:p.231																																																				SPROP:All four kinds of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (see below), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties. Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made. Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws from the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have. The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring. They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him. Fear, hatred, and respect are determined by the DM. The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows: -2 against earth-based effects.	SPROP:. Feather fall (unlimited use, wearer only) . Resist energy (electricity) (unlimited use, wearer only) . Gust of wind (twice per day) . Wind wall (unlimited use) . Air walk (once per day, wearer only) . Chain lightning (once per week) The ring appears to be a ring of feather falling until a certain condition is met, such as having the ring immersed in holy water, single-handedly slaying an air elemental, or whatever the DM determines necessary to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it. Strong conjuration; CL 15th.

Ring of the Ram																OUTPUTNAME:[NAME]								TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:8600	WT:0		EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_50|CHARGES[50]	SOURCEPAGE:p.232																																																				SPROP:The ring of the ram is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram (or a billy goat) as its device. The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance. The ring is useful for knocking opponents off parapets or ledges, among other things. The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended. In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29. A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item. Moderate transmutation; CL 9th

(This ability cannot be aided by the Heal skill.) Nonlethal damage heals at a rate of 1 point of damage per level every 5 minutes. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring regenerates it as the spell. In either case, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated. Strong conjuration; CL 15th
Ring of Shooting Stars															OUTPUTNAME:[NAME]								TYPE:Magic.Ring	COST:50000	WT:0								SOURCEPAGE:p.232																																																				SPROP:This ring has two modes of operation, one for being in shadowy darkness or outdoors at night and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night. During the night under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command. . Dancing lights (once per hour) . Light (twice per night) . Ball lightning (special, once per night) . Shooting stars (special, three per week) The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the ring wearer controls them in the same fashion (see the dancing lights spell description in the Player's Handbook). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created. Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. (Multiple balls can be released in the same round.) The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a fireball) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes, unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile. Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties. . Faerie fire (twice per day) . Spark shower (special, once per day) The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.

A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. For example, a rod that absorbs a 6th-level spell and a 3rdlevel spell has a total of nine absorbed spell levels. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand when casting. Continuing the example above, the rod wielder could use the nine absorbed spell levels to cast one 9th-level spell, or one 5th-level and one 4th-level spell, or nine 1st-level spells, and so on. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know. A rod of absorption absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy. A more specific example: Jozan the cleric uses a brand-new rod of absorption to nullify the effect of a suggestion spell cast at him by a sorcerer. The rod has now absorbed three spell levels and can absorb forty-seven more. Jozan can cast any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell he has prepared, without loss of that preparation, by using the stored potential of the rod. Let's assume he casts hold person back at the sorcerer who just attacked him. This spell is 2nd level for him, so the rod still holds one spell level of potential, can absorb fortyseven more, and has disposed of two spell levels permanently. To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: On a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within. For example, if the first roll determines that the rod has thirty-four levels of absorption potential remaining, that means the rod has absorbed sixteen levels' worth of spells. Half of sixteen is eight, so there's a 30%% chance that it still holds eight absorbed spell levels ready for use. Strong abjuration; CL 15th
Rod (Alertness)				OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mace (Light)	TYPE:Magic.Rod.Weapon.Simple.Melee.Bludgeoning.Mace										COST:85000	WT:4		BASEITEM:Rod		CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1							DAMAGE:1d6										WIELD:Light		SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.234						BONUS:COMBAT|INITIATIVE|1							BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE,TOHIT|1|TYPE=Enhancement	SPROP:This rod is indistinguishable from a +1 light mace. It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the holder to use detect evil, detect good, detect chaos, detect law, detect magic, discern lies, light, or see invisibility. Each different use is a standard action. If the head of a rod of alertness is planted in the ground, and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creature within 120 feet who intends to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a prayer spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of possible danger from the unfriendly creature or creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an animate objects spell, utilizing any eleven (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day. Moderate abjuration, divination, enchantment, and evocation; CL 11th
Rod (Cancellation)			OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]								TYPE:Magic.Rod.Consumable														COST:11000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																												SOURCEPAGE:p.234																									SPROP:This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by wish or miracle. (If a sphere of annihilation and a rod of cancellation negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.) Strong abjuration; CL 17th
Rod (Enemy Detection)			OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]								TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:23500	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																												SOURCEPAGE:p.235																									SPROP:This device pulses in the wielder's hand and points in the direction of any creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of the device (nearest ones first). These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within range. The rod can be used three times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard action. Moderate divination; CL 10th

The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack (see the weapon description on page 117 of the Player's Handbook). The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a -2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat). Once per day the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to grant this benefit. Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action. Moderate enchantment; CL 9th
Rod (Flame Extinguishing)		OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]								TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:15000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																												SOURCEPAGE:p.235																									SPROP:This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges. Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of Medium or smaller (such as that of a flaming weapon or a burning hands spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell. When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by fireball, flame strike, or wall of fire, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod. If the device is used upon a fire creature (a melee touch attack), it deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges. A rod of flame extinguishing has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period. Strong transmutation; CL 12th
Rod (Immovable)				OUTPUTNAME:[NAME] Rod									TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:5000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																												SOURCEPAGE:p.235																									SPROP:This rod is a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Adventurers have found the immovable rod useful for holding ropes, barring doors, and all sorts of other utilitarian tasks. Many adventurers have found it useful to have more than one. Several immovable rods can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An immovable rod can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an immovable rod, it must make a DC_30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round. Moderate transmutation; CL 10th

It also has several more mundane uses. The rod of lordly might is metal, thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. (Pushing any of the rod's buttons is equivalent to drawing a weapon.) It weighs 10 pounds. The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day. . Hold person upon touch, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost. . Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action. . Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the wielder of a like amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person. The following weapon functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. . In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace. . When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon lengthens to an overall length of 4 feet. . When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to 4 feet. . When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or +3 longspear.The spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice), for an overall length of from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance. The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. . Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5. . The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12. . When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.

However, the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral (gold, platinum, quartz, beryl, diamond, corundum, and so on). If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod points to the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round action. Moderate divination; CL 9th

The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a greater dispel magic spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have used a ready action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per day.

If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to become a giant constrictor snake (see page 280 of the Monster Manual for complete statistics) by the end of the round. The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to rod form (a fullround action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A python rod only functions if the possessor is good. Moderate transmutation; CL 10th

The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous. Strong enchantment; CL 20th
Rod (Security)				OUTPUTNAME:Rod of [NAME]								TYPE:Magic.Rod																COST:61000	WT:5		BASEITEM:Rod																												SOURCEPAGE:p.236																									SPROP:This item creates a nondimensional space, a pocket paradise. There the rod's possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time, up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. Thus, one creature (the rod's possessor) can stay for 200 days, four creatures can stay for 50 days, or a group of sixty creatures can stay for 3 days. All fractions are rounded down, so that a group numbering more than 100 can stay for one day only and a group of 201 or more cannot be affected by the rod. In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing take place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved. Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If such a creature succeeds on its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod. When the rod's effect expires or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod's possessor can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week. Strong conjuuration; CL 20th

Once per day, the rod creates and garbs her in clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels. Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part of it, to use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her. The value of noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6 * 1,000 gp)-1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewel trim (maximum of twenty gems, maximum value 200 gp each). In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent-a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as one hundred persons. The tent and its trappings last for one day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear. Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 12th

Its other magical powers are as follows. . Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round. . Lightning: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round. . Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds). . Lightning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet. . Thunder and Lightning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects. Moderate evocation; CL 9th

Continual flame (1 charge) . Levitate (1 charge) . Lightning bolt (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge) . Fireball (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge) . Cone of cold (2 charges) . Hold monster (2 charges) . Wall of force (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only) (2 charges) . Globe of invulnerability (2 charges) The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (*3 on a critical hit) for 1 round. A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-footradius. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 * the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 * the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 4 * the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50%% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi (page 280) and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike. After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.)

Amulet of the Planes																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Amulet																									COST:120000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.247																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize plane shift. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she wants. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01-60 on d%) or to a random plane (61-100). Strong conjuration; CL 15th

Apparatus of the Kwalish																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:90000	WT:500																	SOURCEPAGE:p.247																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This item appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel, but it has a secret catch (Search DC 20 to locate) that opens a hatch in one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds ten (unlabeled) levers: The device has the following characteristics: hp 200; hardness 15; Spd 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural); Atk +12 melee (2d8, 2 pincers). Lever (1d10) Lever Function 1 Extend/retract legs and tail 2 Uncover/cover forward porthole 3 Uncover/cover side portholes 4 Extend/retract pincers and feelers 5 Snap pincers 6 Move forward/backward 7 Turn left/right 8 Open "eyes" with continual flame inside/close "eyes" 9 Rise/sink in water 10 Open/close hatch Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two Medium characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant). When activated, the apparatus looks something like a giant lobster. Strong evocation and transmutation; CL 19th
Bag of Holding (Type I)														OUTPUTNAME:Bag of Holding Type I										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Container								CONTAINS:*250															COST:2500	WT:15																		SOURCEPAGE:p.248																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: Its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs 15lbs and its contents can be up to 250lbs and 30 cubic feet. If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action - unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole (DMG 264), a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.

Bag of Tricks, Gray					KEY:Bag of Tricks (Gray)																				TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:900	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.248																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This small sack appears normal and empty. However, anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the Handle Animal skill (page 74 of the Player's Handbook). The gray bag can produce: 01-30 Bat, 31-60 Rat, 61-75 Cat, 76-90 Weasel, 91-100 Badger.  Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to ten animals can be drawn from the bag each week. Faint conjuration; CL 3rd

Bead of Force																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:3000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.248																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. You can throw it up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. It functions like an Otiluke's resilient sphere spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item. Moderate evocation; CL 10th

The wearer's AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the belt lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk. This AC bonus functions just like the monk's AC bonus. Moderate transmutation; CL 10th

It can be used to store items like any other box. If a command word is given, however, the box unfolds itself to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold to a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship. In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries fifteen with ease. A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again. The words of command may be inscribed visibly or invisibly on the box, or they may be written elsewhere- perhaps on an item within the box. Faint transmutation; CL 6th

Bottle of Air																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:7250	WT:2																		SOURCEPAGE:p.249																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken to any airless environment (such as underwater or in a vacuum), it retains air within it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold her breath. Moderate transmutation; CL 7th
Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals																											TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:100000	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.249																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This large container is usually fashioned from blue or green semiprecious stone (malachite, lapis lazuli, azurite, turquoise, peridot, or sometimes jade). It is about 1 foot in diameter, half that deep, and relatively fragile. When the bowl is filled with fresh water, and certain words are spoken, a Large water elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the bowl functions as the summon monster VI spell. Only one elemental can be called at a time. A new elemental requires the bowl to be filled with new water, which cannot happen until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain). If salt water is used, the elemental is Huge rather than Large (as if summon monster VII had been cast). See page 98 of the Monster Manual for details on water elementals. Strong conjuration; CL 13th

The owner may designate one person known to him to be keyed to one charm. (This designation takes a standard action, but once done it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is called to the spot (a standard action) along with his or her gear, as long as the owner and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed individual knows who is calling, and the bracelet of friends only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25%% less for each missing charm. Strong conjuration; CL 15th

Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:100000	WT:5																		SOURCEPAGE:p.250																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This device appears to be a normal container for holding burning coals. When a fire is lit in the brazier and the proper summoning words are spoken, a Large fire elemental appears. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the brazier functions as the summon monster VI spell. If brimstone is added, the elemental is Huge instead of Large, and the brazier works as a summon monster VII spell. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new fire, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain). See page 98 of the Monster Manual for details on fire elementals. Strong conjuration; CL 13th

The broom can carry 200 pounds and fly at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed at 30 feet. In addition, the broom can travel alone to any destination named by the owner as long as she has a good idea of the location and layout of that destination. It comes to its owner from as far away as 300 yards when she speaks the command word. The broom of flying has a speed of 40 feet when it has no rider. Moderate transmutation; CL 9th
Candle of Invocation																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:8400	WT:0.5																	SOURCEPAGE:p.251																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual so doing if the candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame. A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him, as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties. Strong conjuration; CL 17th

If it is filled with incense and lit, summoning words spoken over it summon forth a Large air elemental. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak. In all ways the censer functions as the summon monster VI spell. If incense of meditation is burned within the censer, the air elemental is an elder air elemental instead (as if summon monster IX had just been cast). Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new piece of incense, which cannot be lit until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain).

The gem grants its possessor the following powers: . Confusion, lesser . Magic circle against law . Word of chaos . Cloak of chaos Each power is usable 1d4 times per day. (The DM rolls secretly each day for each power separately.) A nonchaotic character who possesses a chaos diamond gains one negative level. Although this level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the diamond is in the character's possession and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells).

Chime of Opening																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:3000	WT:1										EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_10|CHARGES[10]			SOURCEPAGE:p.252																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck, a clear tone rings forth, and in 1 round the target lock is unlocked, the shackle is loosed, the secret door is opened, or the lid of the chest is lifted. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of ten times before it cracks and becomes useless. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th

Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground).

Cloak of Etherealness																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Cape																									COST:55000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.253																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This silvery-gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous. Strong transmutation; CL 15th
Cloak of the Manta Ray																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Cape																									COST:7200	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.253																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This cloak appears to be made of leather until the wearer enters salt water. At that time the cloak of the manta ray adheres to the individual, and he appears nearly identical to a manta ray (as the polymorph spell, except that it allows only manta ray form). He gains a +3 natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe underwater, and a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray. Although the cloak does not enable the wearer to bite opponents as a manta ray does, it does have a tail spine that can be used to strike at opponents behind the wearer, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack can be used in addition to any other attack the character has, using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater movement if so desired. Moderate transmutation; CL 9th;

Cube of Force																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:62000	WT:0										EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_36|CHARGES[36]			SOURCEPAGE:p.253																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This device is about the size of a large die (perhaps 3/4 inch across) and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. It enables its possessor to put up a special wall of force 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges, which are renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the table. When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal (40 points of damage drains 1 charge, 50 points drains 2 charges, and so forth). Spells that affect the integrity of the screen, such as disintegrate and passwall, also drain extra charges. Moderate evocation; CL 10th
Cube of Frost Resistance																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:27000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.253																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cubeshaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65degreeF. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks (such as ice storm, cone of cold, and white dragon breath). However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses into its portable form and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10- round period, the cube is destroyed. Faint abjuration; CL 5th
Cubic Gate																															TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:164000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.254																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This item is fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item should choose the planes to which the other five sides are keyed. If such a cube is found as treasure, the DM can determine the planes accessed by the device in any manner he or she chooses. If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10%% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time. If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. (The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves). Strong conjuration; CL 13th
Daern's Instant Fortress				KEY:Instant Fortress			NAMEISPI:YES																TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:55000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.254																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress-even knock spells can't open the door. The adamantine walls of Daern's instant fortress have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of damage taken. The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ). The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty. Strong conjuration; CL 13th
Darkskull																															TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:60000	WT:5																		SOURCEPAGE:p.254																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin (except that no additional spell effect is tied or fixed to the darkskull). Moderate evocation [evil]; CL 9th
Decanter of Endless Water																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:9000	WT:2																		SOURCEPAGE:p.254																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type as well as the volume and velocity. . "Stream" pours out 1 gallon per round. . "Fountain" produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round. . "Geyser" produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round. The geyser effect causes considerable back pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down. The force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage but can only affect one target per round. The command word must be spoken to stop it. Moderate transmutation; CL 9th;
Deck of Illusions																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:8100	WT:0.5									EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_34|CHARGES[34]			SOURCEPAGE:p.254																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of thirty four cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image (PH P252) of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.) Faint illusion; CL 6th
Dimensional Shackles																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:28000	WT:5																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These shackles have golden runes traced across their cold iron surface. Any creature bound within them is affected as if a dimensional anchor spell were cast upon her (no save). They fit any Small to Large creature. The DC to break or slip out of the shackles is 30. Moderate abjuration; CL 11th
Drums of Panic																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:30000	WT:10																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Drums of panic can be used once per day. Moderate necromancy; CL 7th
Dust of Appearance																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:1800	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of blur and displacement. (In this, it works just like the faerie fire spell). The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a -30 penalty on its Hide checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes. Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes. Faint conjuration; CL 5th
Dust of Disappearance																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:3500	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This dust looks just like dust of appearance and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as greater invisibility). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including see invisibility or invisibility purge. Dust of appearance, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by dust of disappearance. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection. The greater invisibility bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds. The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end. Moderate illusion; CL 7th
Dust of Dryness																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:850	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed to nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids. If the dust is employed against an elemental with the water subtype, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th
Dust of Illusion																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:1200	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. Stare at it, however, and the dust changes color and form. Put dust of illusion on a creature, and that creature is affected as if by a disguise self glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours. Faint illusion; CL 6th
Dust of Tracelessness																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:250	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade. A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal. Faint transmutation; CL 3rd
Efreeti Bottle																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:145000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. A thin stream of smoke is often seen issuing from it. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly. There is a 10%% chance (01-10 on d%%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10%% chance (91-100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, the efreeti afterward disappears forever. The other 80%% of the time (11-90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. (See page 115 of the Monster Manual for efreeti statistics.) Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect. Strong conjuration; CL 14th

Elixir of Fire Breath																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Potion.Consumable																							COST:1100	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This strange elixir bestows upon the drinker the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three times, each time dealing 4d6 points of fire damage to a single target up to 25 feet away. The victim can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage.

The charm effects wear off in 1d3 hours. Faint transmutation; CL 4th
Elixir of Sneaking																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Potion.Consumable																							COST:250	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.255																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This draught of liquid grants the drinker the ability to walk softly and dampens sound around her slightly, granting a +10 competence bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 hour.

An almost imperceptible magic sheath surrounds the drinker, allowing him to glide through the water easily (+10 competence bonus on Swim checks for 1 hour). Faint illusion; CL 2nd
Elixir of Truth																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Potion.Consumable																							COST:500	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.256																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This elixir forces the individual drinking it to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates). She is compelled to answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she is free to make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn't break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn't have to answer that particular question. No more than one question can be asked each round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment. Faint enchantment; CL 5th
Elixir of Vision																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Potion.Consumable																							COST:250	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.256																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:Drinking this elixir grants the imbiber the ability to notice acute details with great accuracy (+10 competence bonus on Search checks for 1 hour). Faint divination; CL 2nd
Eversmoking Bottle																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:5400	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.256																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking bottle is stoppered. The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round. Faint transmutation; CL 3rd
Eyes of Charming																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Eyegear																									COST:56000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.256																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These two crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes. The wearer is able to use charm person (one target per round) merely by meeting a target's gaze. Those failing a DC 16 Will save are charmed as per the spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. Moderate enchantment; CL 7th

Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doom spell. If the wearer has only one lens, the DC of the saving throw is reduced to 10. However, if the wearer has both lenses, he gains the additional power of a continual deathwatch effect and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week.

If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function: The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse (see page 273 of the Monster Manual) in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of one day each week-continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day before it can again be used. The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare (see page 194 of the Monster Manual) except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn).

However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every two weeks for up to 3 hours per use.

On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse (see page 273 of the Monster Manual) with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10%% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.

Helm of Brilliance																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Headgear																									COST:125000	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.258										ABILITY:Special Ability|VIRTUAL|Resistance To Fire (Sp)																																																																																																					BONUS:VAR|FireResistanceBonusSp|30|TYPE=Base																																																																																																																																	SPROP:This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows: . Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20) . Ruby: Wall of fire . Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half ) . Opal: Daylight The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated. . It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range. . The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon (see page 224). This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect. . The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources, such as resist energy. Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it. If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed. Strong varied; CL 13th
Helm of Comprehend Languages and Read Magic																									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Headgear																									COST:5200	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.259																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:Appearing as a normal helmet, a helm of comprehend languages and read magic grants its wearer the ability to understand the spoken words of any creature and to read text in any language and any magical writing. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Decipher Script checks to understand messages written in incomplete, archaic, or exotic forms. Note that understanding a magical text does not necessarily imply spell use. Faint divination; CL 4th

Helm of Underwater Action																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Headgear																									COST:57000	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.259																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:The wearer of this helmet can see underwater. Drawing the small lenses in compartments on either side into position before the wearer's eyes activates the visual properties of the helm, allowing her to see five times farther than water and light conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the helm of underwater action creates a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely. Faint transmutation; CL 5th
Heward's Handy Haversack				KEY:Handy Haversack																					TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Container								CONTAINS:*120															COST:2000	WT:5																		SOURCEPAGE:p.259																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds. While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power in addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does. Moderate conjuration; CL 9th
Horn of Blasting																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:20000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.259																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This horn appears to be a normal trumpet. It can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage, with no save unless they're held, worn, or carried by creatures (Will DC 16 negates). If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20%% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of damage to the person sounding it. Moderate evocation; CL 7th

Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the horn of blasting. A greater horn of blasting also has a 20%% cumulative chance of exploding. Strong evocation; CL 16th
Horn of Fog																															TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:2000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.259																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; fog clouds travel 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghornlike noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. Faint conjuration; CL 3rd
Horn of Goodness/Evil																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:6500	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.259																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner's alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If he is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against evil. If he is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a magic circle against good. In either case, this ward lasts for 1 hour. The horn can be blown once per day. Faint abjuration; CL 6th
Horn of the Tritons																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:15100	WT:2																		SOURCEPAGE:p.260																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This device is a conch shell that can be blown once per day except by a triton (see page 245 of the Monster Manual), which can sound it three times per day. A horn of the tritons can perform any one of the following functions when blown. . Calm rough waters in a 1-mile radius. This effect dispels a summoned water elemental if it fails a DC 16 Will save. . Attract 5d4 Large sharks (01-30 on d%), 5d6 Medium sharks (31-80), or 1d10 sea lions (81-100) if the character is in a body of water in which such creatures dwell. The creatures are friendly and obey, to the best of their ability, the one who sounded the horn. . Causes aquatic creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 within 500 feet to become panicked as if they had been targeted by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who successfully save are shaken for 3d6 rounds. Any sounding of a horn of the tritons can be heard by all tritons within a 3-mile radius. Moderate conjuration and transmutation; CL 8th
Horn of Valhalla (Brass)																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:50000	WT:2																		SOURCEPAGE:p.260																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every seven days. Roll d% and refer to the table below to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned. Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians given on page 26 of the Player's Handbook. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first. Strong conjuration; CL 13th

They allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava, can be crossed, and that movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal for the magic to be effective. Faint transmutation; CL 3rd

When it is burning, the special fragrance and pearly-hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check. When a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat). Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours. Moderate enchantment; CL 7th

When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. Ioun stones have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5. Moderate varied; CL 12th	SPROP:Absorbs spells of 8th level or lower (up to 50 levels before becoming dull grey and useless, requires readied action). This works like a rod of absorption, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells.
Iron Bands of Binding																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:26000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.261																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:When initially discovered, this very potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe. When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and ruin) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 Escape Artist check. Iron bands of Bilarro are usable once per day. Strong evocation; CL 13th
Iron Flask																															TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Vial																									COST:170000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.261																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature. The command word can be given only once per day. If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. Strong conjuration; CL 20th

Lyre of Building																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:13000	WT:5																		SOURCEPAGE:p.261																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against all inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes. The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, or whatever. The effect produced in but 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for three days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed. Faint transmutation; CL 6th

Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be struck dead, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user.

Any creature of at least Huge size can use it to loosen or tumble earth or earthen ramparts (a 10-foot cube every 10 minutes). It also smashes rock (a 10-foot cube per hour). If used as a weapon, it is the equivalent of a Gargantuan +3 adamantine warhammer, dealing 4d6 points of base damage. Strong transmutation; CL 16th

Mirror of Life Trapping																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:200000	WT:50																		SOURCEPAGE:p.262																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has fifteen nonspatial extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50%% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack; see page 294). When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner. If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is broken, all victims currently trapped in it are freed and usually promptly attack the possessor of the device in revenge for their imprisonment. Strong abjuration; CL 17th
Mirror of Mental Prowess																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:175000	WT:40																		SOURCEPAGE:p.262																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. The possessor who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows. . Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language. . View other places as if with clairvoyance, but vision extends even onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them. . Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror. . Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell). Strong conjuration and divination; CL 17th
Mirror of Opposition																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:92000	WT:45																		SOURCEPAGE:p.262																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and her items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day. Strong necromancy; CL 15th

If the spoon is placed in an empty container- a bowl, a cup, or a dish, for example-the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although this substance has a flavor similar to that of warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans. Faint conjuration; CL 5th

(It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is-a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half ). Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals (ranging from 300 gp for a 2d6 sphere to 1,500 gp for a 10d6 sphere). Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer. Moderate evocation; CL 10th

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer. Moderate evocation; CL 10th
Necklace of Fireballs VII													OUTPUTNAME:Necklace of Fireballs Type VII									TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:8700	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.263																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:his device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is-a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half ). Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals (ranging from 300 gp for a 2d6 sphere to 1,500 gp for a 10d6 sphere).

Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments				KEY:Marvelous Pigments																					TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:4000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.263																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These magic emulsions enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the desired image. One pot of Nolzur's marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. Thus, a 10-foot-by-10- foot rendition of a pit would result in an actual 10-foot-by-10-footby- 10-foot pit; a 10-foot-by-10-foot depiction of a room would result in a 10-foot-by-10-foot-by-10-foot room; and so on. Only normal, inanimate objects can be created-doors, pits, flowers, trees, cells, and so on. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface (a floor, wall, ceiling, door, or the like). It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. Nolzur's marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments- precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on- appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, paste, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp. Items created are not magical; the effect is instantaneous.

Pipes of Haunting																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:6000	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.264																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. Pipes of haunting can be sounded twice a day. Faint necromancy; CL 4th
Pipes of Pain																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:12000	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.264																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These appear to be like any other standard set of pipes with nothing to reveal their true nature. When played by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create a wondrous melody. All within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Will save or be fascinated by the sound. (This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion.) As soon as the piping stops, all those affected are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a character is in a totally silent area, she takes 1d4 points of damage per round for 2d4 rounds. During this time, damage from sonic attacks, such as sound burst, is doubled. Thereafter, the least noise causes an affected character to become shaken (except when she is in a totally silent area). This hypersensitivity is a curse and therefore hard to remove (see the bestow curse spell). Faint enchantment and evocation; CL 6th
Pipes of the Sewers																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:1150	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.264																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These wooden pipes appear ordinary, but if the possessor learns the proper tune, he can attract 1d3 rat swarms (see page 239 of the Monster Manual) if rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1- round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. If they are called again within a day, the Perform check DC is 15. If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control. Faint conjuration; CL 2nd

Portable Hole																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Container								CONTAINS:*UNLIM|Any														COST:20000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.264																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains. The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. (See Suffocation, page 304.) The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled (with gold, for example). Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding (see page 248) is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process. Moderate conjuration; CL 12th

A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed-if a severe wind is already blowing, for example, this wind cannot be added to it to create a windstorm. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land. Moderate conjuration; CL 12th

It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to sixty objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to eighteen objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as six objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can produce any item she wishes, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The quiver of Ehlonna weighs the same no matter what's placed inside it.

This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, and even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate. A Small character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily.

Robe of Scintillating Colors																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Robe																									COST:27000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.265																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:The wearer of this robe can cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light. The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings. It takes 1 full round after the wearer speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting pattern effect. Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks against the wearer starts at 10%% and increases by 10%% each round until it reaches 50%% (total concealment). The robe illuminates a 30-foot radius continuously. The effect can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day. Moderate illusion; CL 11th;

Only the wearer of the robe can see these patches, recognize them for what items they become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round. Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful items always has two each of the following patches: . Dagger . Bullseye lantern (filled and lit) . Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror) . Pole (10-foot length) . Hempen rope (50-foot coil) . Sack In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on the table below to determine its nature.

Rope of Climbing																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:3000	WT:3																		SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:A 60-foot-long rope of climbing is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner. A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied but lowers the DC of Climb checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked. Faint transmutation; CL 3rd
Rope of Entanglement																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:21000	WT:5																		SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. The rope has AC 22, 12 hit points, and hardness 10, and it has damage reduction 5/slashing as well. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of entanglement is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed. Moderate transmutation; CL 12th
Salve of Slipperiness																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Vial.Consumable																								COST:1000	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all Escape Artist checks, meaning that it is almost impossible to grapple such a character or to tie or chain him up. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting grease spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine). Salve of slipperiness is needed to coat the inside of a container that is meant to hold sovereign glue (see below). Faint conjuration; CL 6th
Scabbard of Keen Edges																													TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:16000	WT:1																		SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This scabbard is fashioned from cured leather and fine silver.

If it is held for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface letting the holder know that it is a protective device. The scarab's possessor gains spell resistance 20. The scarab can also absorb energy-draining attacks (such as the slam attack of a vampire spawn), death effects (such as finger of death), and negative energy effects (such as from an inflict critical wounds spell). Upon absorbing twelve such attacks, the scarab turns to powder and is destroyed. Strong abjuration and necromancy; CL 18th

A scarab enables its possessor to combat golems with weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons as if those golems had no damage reduction. Moderate divination; CL 8th;
Shrouds of Disintegration																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Consumable																								COST:6600	WT:10																		SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:These burial wrappings look to be made of fine, embroidered materials. When a body is placed inside, a command word will turn it to dust. The magic of the shrouds is usable only once, after which the wrappings become ordinary, fine cloth. Strong transmutation; CL 15th
Silversheen																															TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Vial.Consumable																								COST:250	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This substance can be applied to a weapon as a standard action. It will give the weapon the properties of alchemical silver (see page 284) for 1 hour, replacing the properties of any other special material it might have. For example, a +1 holy adamantine longsword becomes a +1 holy silver longsword for the duration of the effect. One vial will coat a single melee weapon or 20 units of ammunition. Faint transmutation; CL 5th
Slippers of Spider Climbing																												TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Boot																									COST:4800	WT:0.5	SLOTS:2															SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:When worn, a pair of these slippers enable movement on vertical surfaces or even upside down along ceilings, leaving the wearer's hands free. Her speed is 20 feet. Severely slippery surfaces-icy, oiled, or greased surfaces- make these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10 minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses. Faint transmutation; CL 4th
Sovereign Glue																														TYPE:Magic.Wondrous.Vial.Consumable																								COST:2400	WT:0																		SOURCEPAGE:p.266																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness (see the previous page), and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. (Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.) Strong transmutation; CL 20th;

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd;
Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals																										TYPE:Magic.Wondrous																										COST:100000	WT:5																		SOURCEPAGE:p.267																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SPROP:A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock. The possessor of such a stone need but utter a few words of summoning, and a Huge earth elemental comes to the summoner. The summoning words require 1 full round to speak, and in all ways the stone functions as the summon monster VII spell. (If sand or rough, unhewn stone is the summoning medium, the elemental that comes is Large instead, and the stone functions as the summon monster VI spell.) The elemental appears in 1d4 rounds. For detailed information about elementals, see page 95 of the Monster Manual. Only one elemental can be summoned at a time. A new elemental requires a new patch of earth or stone, which cannot be accessed until after the first elemental disappears (is dispelled, dismissed, or slain). Strong conjuration; CL 13th;

A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or feed. Damage dealt to it can be repaired by first using a stone to flesh spell, thus causing the stone horse to become a normal horse that can be healed normally. When fully healed, it automatically reverts to its stone form. While in its stone form, it can be fed gems, healing 1 point of damage for each 50 gp worth of mineral it is given. There are two sorts of stone horses. Courser: This item has the statistics of a heavy horse (see page 273 of the Monster Manual), as well as having hardness 10.

Book of Exalted Deeds																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor.Book																	COST:0	WT:3																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.277							ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Negative Levels																																																															BONUS:VAR|NegLevels|1|!PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1																									SPROP:This holy book is sacred to divine spellcasters of good alignment (LG, NG, CG). Study of the work requires one week, but upon completion a good spellcaster gains a +1 inherent bonus to Wisdom and one experience level-receiving enough XP to put the character's XP total midway between the minimum needed for his new (higher) level and the minimum needed for the level beyond that. Divine spellcasters neither good nor evil (LN, N, CN) lose 2d6*1,000 XP for perusing the work. Evil divine spellcasters (LE, NE, CE) lose twice that amount. In addition, they have to atone (see the atonement spell) in order to gain further experience. Nonspellcasters who handle or read the book are unaffected. Arcane spellcasters who read it take 1 point of permanent Intelligence drain and lose 1d6*1,000 XP unless they make a DC 15 Will save. Except as indicated above, the writing in a book of exalted deeds can't be distinguished from any other magic book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, and the same character can never benefit from reading another book of exalted deeds. Strong evocation [good]; CL 19th;
Book of Infinite Spells																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor.Book																	COST:0	WT:3																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.277							ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Negative Levels																																																															BONUS:VAR|NegLevels|1|!PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1																									SPROP:This work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a dice roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll spells (the third column on Table 7-22: Scroll Spell Levels, along with Table 7-23: Arcane Spell Scrolls and Table 7-24: Divine Spell Scrolls). Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself. The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power. Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The owner knows this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is. Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on. Strong (all schools); CL 18th
Book of Vile Darkness																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor.Book																	COST:0	WT:3																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.277							ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Negative Levels																																																															BONUS:VAR|NegLevels|1|!PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=1																									SPROP:This is a work of ineffable evil-meat and drink to divine spellcasters of that alignment (LE, NE, CE). To fully consume the contents requires one week of study. Once this has been accomplished, an evil spellcaster gains a +1 inherent bonus to Wisdom and one experience level-receiving enough XP to put the character's XP total midway between the minimum needed for his new (higher) level and the minimum needed for the level beyond that. All lawful neutral, neutral, or chaotic neutral characters who touch the book take 5d4 points of damage, and reading its pages causes them to become evil (Will DC 13 negates). Such converts immediately seek out an evil cleric to confirm their new alignment (with an atonement spell). Divine spellcasters neither good nor evil (LN, N, CN) who read the book either lose 2d6*1,000 XP (01-50 on d%) or become evil without benefit from the book (51-100). Good divine spellcasters (LG, NG, CG) perusing the pages of the book of vile darkness have to make a DC 16 Fortitude save or die. If they do not die, they must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or suffer from a continuous confusion effect (per the insanity spell). In the latter event, even if the save is successful, the character loses 20,000 XP, minus 1,000 for each point of Wisdom he has. (This calculation cannot result in an XP gain.) Other characters of good alignment take 5d6 points of damage from just handling the tome. If such a character looks inside, there is an 80%% chance that an evil outsider attacks the character that night. Strong evocation [evil]; CL 19th
Deck of Many Things																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor																		COST:0	WT:0																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.278																																																																																																														SPROP:A deck of many things (both beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. Exception: If the jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below. Balance: As in "weighed in the balance and found wanting," the character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment- either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being, at the DM's option. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Whether these items are recoverable is, likewise, up to the DM. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, the gems 1,000 gp value each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character; use the weapon tables beginning with Table 7-10: Weapon Type Determination until a useful item is awarded. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. (See Chapter 4 of this book for typical NPC statistics for a 4th-level fighter.) Moon: This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith (see page 258 of the Monster Manual) appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. The character must fight it alone-if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item (Table 7-28: Medium Wondrous Items) until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably gone. Throne:The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another question entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards. Strong (all schools); CL 20th.
Hammer of Thunderbolts											PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Warhammer													TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor.Weapon.Melee.Ranged.Thrown.Martial.Specific.Bludgeoning.Hammer								COST:0	WT:15							CRITMULT:x3	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:4d6	EQMOD:MAGIC_COST|-32300.PLUS3W.RETRN.STEEL		WIELD:OneHanded				MODS:NO			RANGE:30	SIZE:L	SOURCEPAGE:p.279																																																																																						BONUS:WEAPON|DAMAGE,TOHIT|4|TYPE=Enhancement|PREEQUIP:1,Gauntlets of Ogre Power|PREEQUIP:1,Belt of Giant Strength +4,Belt of Giant Strength +6	SPROP:This +3 Large returning warhammer deals 4d6 points of damage on any hit. Further, if the wielder wears a belt of giant Strength and gauntlets of ogre power and he knows that the hammer is a hammer of thunderbolts (not just a +3 warhammer), the weapon can be used to full effect: It gains a total +5 enhancement bonus, allows all belt and gauntlet bonuses to stack (only when using this weapon), and strikes dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fortitude DC 20 negates the death effect but not the damage). When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates). The hammer's range increment is 30 feet. Strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 20th	SPROP:Strikes dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fort DC 20 negates the death effect but not the damage)	SPROP:When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fort DC 15 negates)
Philosopher's Stone																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor																		COST:0	WT:3																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.279																																																																																																														SPROP:This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period. The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon. Strong transmutation; CL 20th;
Sphere of Annihilation																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor																		COST:0	WT:0																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.279																																																																																																														SPROP:A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character. A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30. If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest. Should a gate spell be cast upon a sphere of annihilation, there is a 50%% chance (01-50 on d%) that the spell destroys it, a 35%% chance (51-85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15%% chance (86-100) that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane (see page 151 for a way to determine this randomly). If a rod of cancellation touches a sphere of annihilation, they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6*10 points of damage. Dispel magic and Mordenkainen's disjunction have no effect on a sphere. See also talisman of the sphere (below). Strong transmutation; CL 20th.
Staff of the Magi																													TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor.Staff																	COST:0	WT:5													EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_50|CHARGES[50]																		SOURCEPAGE:p.280																																																						BONUS:MISC|SR|23																																																						SPROP:A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. The following powers do not use charges: . Detect magic . Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates) . Hold portal . Light . Mage armor . Mage hand The following powers drain 1 charge per usage: . Dispel magic . Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) . Ice storm . Invisibility . Knock . Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) . Passwall . Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates) . Wall of fire . Web These powers drain 2 charges per usage: . Monster summoning IX . Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates) . Telekinesis (400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates) A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption (page 234) does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.) Retributive Strike: A staff of the magi can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50%% chance (01-50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence (see Table 5-7, page 151), but if she does not (51-100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her. Only specific items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power (page 245), are capable of a retributive strike. Strong (all schools); CL 20th
Talisman of Pure Good																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor																		COST:0	WT:0													EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_6|CHARGES[6]																		SOURCEPAGE:p.280																																																																																																														SPROP:A good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of an evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed (DM's discretion), the evil character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function. (In the air, in a high tower, or on a ship are all places of safety against this otherwise potent item.) A talisman of pure good has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, he takes 6d6 points of damage. If an evil divine spellcaster touches one, he takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device. Strong evocation [good]; CL 18th.
Talisman of the Sphere																												TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor																		COST:0	WT:0																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.280																																																																																																														SPROP:This small adamantine loop and handle are useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of annihilation (page 279), a talisman of the sphere doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose). If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled. Strong transmutation; CL 16th;
Talisman of Ultimate Evil																											TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor																		COST:0	WT:0													EQMOD:CHARGED_ITEM_6|CHARGES[6]																		SOURCEPAGE:p.280																																																																																																														SPROP:An evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of a good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity (DM's discretion), the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function. (In the air, in a high tower, or on a ship are all places of safety against this otherwise potent item.) A talisman of ultimate evil has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes 6d6 points of damage. If a good divine spellcaster touches one, she takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters are unaffected by the device. Strong evocation [evil]; CL 18th.
Talisman of Zagy																													TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Minor																		COST:0	WT:0																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.280																																																																																																														SPROP:A talisman of this sort appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals. Its powers are quite different, however, and dependent on the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. Whenever a character touches a talisman of Zagy, he must make a DC 15 Charisma check. If he fails, the device acts as a stone of weight (page 276). Discarding or destroying it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears. If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants him one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma. It also grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.) Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of Zagy disappears when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead. Strong conjuration; CL 20th;


#MAJOR ARTIFACTS
The Hand and Eye of Vecna																											TYPE:Magic.Artifact.Major																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.281																																																																																																														SPROP:The archlich Vecna may have been the most powerful wizard ever to have lived. He may also have been the most evil. Apparently risen now to deityhood, he left behind relics embodying remnants of his power-the mummified remains of his hand and his eye. Powers of the Eye: In order to function, the Eye of Vecna must be placed in the empty socket of a character's skull. The bearer of the Eye loses 2 points of Charisma, and these points may never be restored. The Eye may not thereafter be removed without resulting in the death of its host. It grants the host continuous darkvision and true seeing. Three times per day each, the host can use the spells eyebite and domination. Once per day, the bearer of the Eye can call forth destruction and unhallow. A nonevil character must make a DC 17 Will save each week to avoid becoming evil. All powers are at caster level 20th, and all DCs to resist their effects are 20. Powers of the Hand: In order to function, the Hand of Vecna must be placed on the end of a left arm whose original hand has been severed. The bearer of the Hand loses 2 points of Dexterity that may never be regained. Removal of the hand thereafter always results in the death of the host. The touch of the Hand, once so placed, deals 1d10 points of cold damage to a target. Three times per day, its touch can permanently drain 1 ability score point (host's choice of ability) from a victim. The host gains the points drained for the rest of that day.

At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the Moaning Diamond is not evil (although it was birthed in torture). The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell stone shape, affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. The Moaning Diamond can summon an elder earth elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain. Only one such elemental can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for 24 hours. Tales from the past tell of the Moaning Diamond creating stone structures, opening underground chambers where there had been none before, and collapsing entire castles.

The bearer of an Orb can dominate dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist.

A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon-but only the breath weapon-of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Thus, the possessor of the Red Dragon Orb of Dragonkind is immune to red dragon breath, but not fire of any other sort. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day (see the Monster Manual). All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of the creature. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity forever of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if she later loses the item.
