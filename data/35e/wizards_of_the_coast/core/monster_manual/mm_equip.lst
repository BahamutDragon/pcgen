#Githyanki Silver Sword	+1 silvered greatsword that looks much like a standard weapon while still in its sheath. But when drawn, the silver sword transforms into a column of silvery liquid, altering the weapon's balance round by round as the blade's shape flows and shimmers. A silver sword has the additional quality of reaching into the minds of the foes it strikes, disrupting their psionic powers. A target hit by the weapon must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or lose any psionic abilities for 1d4 rounds.
