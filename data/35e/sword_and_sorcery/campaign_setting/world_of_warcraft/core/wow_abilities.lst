Arcane Corruption	KEY:Arcanist ~ Arcane Corruption	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The arcane energy that a necromancer or warlock uses will corrupt her. For every 5 levels of necromancer or warlock the character has, her alignment takes one step toward an evil alignment in line with her current alignment (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). For instance, if Higgins the human necromancer is lawful neutral at 1st level, at 5th level his alignment will shift to Lawful Evil. (For a more detailed arcane corruption variant rules system, see Magic &amp; Mayhem.)
Arcane Path		KEY:Arcanist ~ Arcane Path		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Arcanists take levels in one of three "paths" (mage, necromancer or warlock), with each path casting spells from its own spell list and gaining special abilities that reinforce and enhance its particular brand of magic. Each path also faces certain restrictions when learning and casting spells from the spell list of another path (in the case of multiclassing).	DESC:&nl; All arcanists have these class features based on their chosen paths:	DESC:&nl; An arcanist can cast one additional spell per spell level per day from his specific spell list. A multiclassed arcanist must choose the path spell list for his additional spell; the path spell list need not be the same for each spell level. Thus, the arcanist receives only one additional spell per spell level per day, regardless of how many paths in which he has levels.	DESC:&nl; The save DCs of spells from the arcanist's path spell lists are increased by +1.	DESC:&nl; The arcanist receives a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells from his path spell list(s).	DESC:&nl; An arcanist acquires special abilities, called "arcana," at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and 16th level according to his path, as noted in Table 3-3: The Arcanist and described below.	DESC:&nl; Forbidden Arts: While all arcanists can cast spells from the general arcanist spell list, they face certain restrictions when casting spells from another path's spell list. They cast spells from another path's spell list with a -2 caster level penalty (minimum caster level 1st, but these penalties stack with those imposed by arcane addiction). The save DCs of such spells are reduced by -2, and there is a 2%% chance per spell level of spell failure when casting spells from another path's spell list. Arcanists cannot learn spells from another path's spell list unless they have at least one level in that path. (See Chapter 16 for spell lists.) These restrictions apply to all but the arcanist's current path, which is the path in which she most recently took a level.

At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat or an item creation feat. The arcanist must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

# Mage Path:
Summon Familiar		KEY:Mage Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A mage can obtain a familiar. A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a mage. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar. A familiar also grants special abilities to its master, as indicated on Table 3-5. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other. Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level. See the "Familiar Basics" sidebar for more details on summoning familiars.	BONUS:VAR|FamiliarLVL|Arcanist_MageLVL	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Familiar
Call Elemental		KEY:Mage Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the mage can summon an air, earth, fire or water elemental as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability is similar to summon monster, save that the duration is equal to 5 minutes per point of the mage's Intellect modifier. The elemental's size depends on the mage's level, as shown on the following table. The mage can use this ability twice per day at 12th level and three times per day at 20th level.
Enhanced Counterspell	KEY:Mage Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Mages understand the workings of arcane energy so well that they can counter most magic with great effectiveness. When attempting to counter a spell, a mage adds her arcanist path level to her counterspell check. In addition, the mage may counter a spell with any other spell she has prepared as long as it is the same level of the spell being countered and the spell being used to counter is from the same school of magic. Necromancy or conjuration (summoning) spells cannot be counterspelled in this manner by mages. Mages must use dispel magic to counter spells from those schools.
Arcane Adept		KEY:Mage Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A mage's dedication to and natural predilection for one of her schools of specialization becomes more entrenched. The mage chooses either evocation or transmutation as a preferred school. She casts spells from this preferred school at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Fire and Frost		KEY:Mage Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The mages of Kirin Tor first mastered the arts of casting spells using the elements of ice and fire. Mages may memorize an additional spell per level as long as it has the cold or fire elemental descriptor. This additional spell is cast with the effects of the Maximize Spell feat; however, the spell's level does not change. This ability stacks with the effects of the Maximize Spell feat, which does change the spell's level.

# Necromancer Path
Death Touch		KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By wielding the forces of undeath, the necromancer draws vitality from the living. Death touch is a death effect. The necromancer must succeed on a melee touch attack against a living creature (using the rules for touch spells). When he touches, roll 1d6 per necromancer level he possesses. If the total at least equals the creature's current hit points, it dies (no save). The necromancer can use this ability once per day at 1st level, twice per day at 9th level, and three times per day at 18th level .
Death Resistance	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer becomes immune to all death spells and magical death effects. This immunity does not protect the necromancer from other sorts of attacks such as hit point loss, poison, petrification or other effects even if they might be lethal.
Animate Dead	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer may animate undead creatures using the vile magic at his disposal. This ability functions like the spell of the same name, but with the following exceptions. The necromancer may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his necromancer levels divided by 2 (1/ day at 1st level). The limit of undead the necromancer can control is equal to 2 Hit Dice per level. The amount of undead controlled by this ability counts toward the number that can be controlled with the animate dead spell as normally cast by the necromancer.
Dark Arts		KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Necromancers are skilled in wielding magic that causes pain, suffering and death. Mastering the dark arts allows the necromancer to cast spells from the necromancy school at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Create Undead	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer's knowledge of undeath reaches such unsurpassed depths that he can create powerful undead. He can use this ability like create undead twice per day or like create greater undead once per day. The ability is cast at the necromancer's path level.

# Warlock Path:
Fel Companion	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the warlock gains a fel companion. The warlock can summon the fel companion and dismiss it at any time so that he may summon a new one. The fel companion must be an evil outsider with a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than the warlock's arcanist path level (to a maximum of 10 HD). Should the fel companion die while in service to the warlock, the warlock must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save, at +1 DC for each HD of the companion. If the saving throw fails, the warlock loses 400 XP per warlock level; success reduces the loss to half of that amount. In addition, the warlock must make a DC 15 Will save or take 1d6 points of Stamina damage as the companion's sudden loss tears away part of the warlock's life force. A warlock can obtain another fel companion by performing a ceremony of summoning. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp per HD of the creature summoned. The creature serves as a willing companion and servant. Dismissing a fel companion is a free action, and a dismissed creature immediately returns to its plane of origin.
Summoner		KEY:Warlock Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock receives the Augment Summoning feat for free. At 6th level, all conjuration (summoning) spells cast by the warlock have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat is applied to them. The level of an augmented conjuration (summoning) spell does not change; this ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell's level (see Chapter 6: Feats).
Enslave Outsider	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A warlock is adept at convincing outsiders to do his bidding. When a warlock casts lesser planar binding, planar binding, or greater planar binding, he can add his ranks in any one relevant Knowledge skill (the planes, especially the Emerald Dream and the Twisting Nether; demons; the Burning Legion, and so forth) or in Spellcraft, whichever is higher, to the caster level check or the Charisma check made to keep the outsider trapped.
Demonologist	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The craft of conjuration is the primary focus of the warlock, and in taking on the mantle of a demonologist the warlock sacrifices knowledge in other areas of arcane practice. The warlock casts conjuration (summoning) spells at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Demon Mastery	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock has learned the compacts and rites necessary to bind a demonic creature to his will. The warlock rebukes and controls outsiders the same as an evil priest rebukes or commands undead. Use the warlock's arcanist path levels to determine the equivalent of a turning check, and apply the relevant outsider Hit Dice to the undead HD chart (see Chapter 12: Combat, "Turn or Rebuke Undead"). The warlock may also bolster outsiders he controls in the same way that an evil priest bolsters undead. The warlock can attempt to control or rebuke outsiders a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier; he may attempt to bolster outsiders that he did not summon himself.



###Block: Barbarian
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Barbarian ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor and shields (except tower shields).
Fast Movement			KEY:Barbarian ~ Fast Movement				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load he carries or armor he wears.
Illiteracy				KEY:Barbarian ~ Illiteracy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak. A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he already had.
Rage					KEY:Barbarian ~ Rage					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Stamina and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Stamina increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Stamina score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Agility- or Intellectbased skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration; nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the barbarian's (newly improved) Stamina modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Agility, cannot charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below). A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Barbarian ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Agility bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flatfooted or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Agility bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Trap Sense				KEY:Barbarian ~ Trap Sense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Barbarian ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to backstab the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If the barbarian already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank him.
Damage Reduction			KEY:Barbarian ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time a weapon or a natural attack deals damage to him. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by +1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
Greater Rage			KEY:Barbarian ~ Greater Rage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Stamina during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.
Indomitable Will			KEY:Barbarian ~ Indomitable Will			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.
Tireless Rage			KEY:Barbarian ~ Tireless Rage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.
Mighty Rage				KEY:Barbarian ~ Mighty Rage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Stamina during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Healer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Healers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are proficient with light armor only.
Spells						KEY:Healer ~ Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A healer casts divine spells, which are drawn from the healer spell list and the individual spell lists for each path. However, her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see "Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells," below. A healer must choose and prepare her spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a healer must have a Spirit score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a healer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the healer's Spirit modifier. Like other spellcasters, a healer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell slot allotment is given on Table 3-9: Healer Spell Slots per Day (her total healer level, regardless of path, is used to determine her spell slots per day). In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Spirit score. Healers meditate or pray for their spells. Each healer must spend 1 minute in quiet contemplation or supplication per level of spell being prepared to regain her daily allotment of spells. A healer may prepare and cast any spell on the healer spell list as well as the spell list of her specific path, if she can cast spells of that level, but she must meditate while preparing them.
Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells	KEY:Healer ~ Alignment Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A healer can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own. Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
Domain Spells					KEY:Healer ~ Domain Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A healer gains a domain (or greater and lesser domains) belonging to her path and gains those domain abilities in addition to abilities normally available to the healer's path. In addition, she may prepare an additional spell of each level she can cast from her domain(s), and she receives an additional spell slot at each level that can only be used for a domain spell.
Healer's Path					KEY:Healer ~ Healer's Path			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Healers take levels in one of three "paths" (druid, priest or shaman), with each path honoring a specific philosophy and form of worship. The spells that healers cast and the special abilities they gain reinforce and distinguish the aims and beliefs of each path. All healers have these class features based on their chosen path:
Spontaneous Casting				KEY:Healer ~ Spontaneous Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Healers can channel stored spell energy into casting spells that are not prepared. The healer can "lose" any prepared spell slot that is not a domain spell in order to cast certain spells of the same spell level or lower (see the description of each path below for specific details).
Turn or Rebuke					KEY:Healer ~ Turn or Rebuke			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:A healer has the power to affect certain creatures depending on her path and her alignment by focusing the power of her faith through a holy symbol or some other sacred item. Each path can turn or rebuke specific types of creatures. See the description of each path, below, for details. A healer can make a number of turn or rebuke attempts per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Healers with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) receive a +2 bonus on their turn or rebuke checks. See "Turning and Rebuking Undead" in Chapter 12: Combat.
Domains						KEY:Healer ~ Domains				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Healers gain access to domains related either to the path or faith they follow. Domains grant healers special powers depending on their level of access. As well, healers can prepare an additional domain spell of each spell level they can cast, and they receive an additional spell slot at each level that can only be used for a domain spell. See Table 3-8: The Healer for when healers gain access to domains. Each domain grants special powers depending on whether a healer has lesser or greater access to it. Lesser access allows a healer to cast spells of up to 3rd level in a domain, while greater access allows a healer to cast any spell in a domain. Healers cast any spell on the healer spell list and on the spell list for their specific paths (see Chapter 16: Spell Lists), but they prepare an additional spell per spell level only from the domains to which they have access. When a healer has access to two domains (starting at 10th level), she must choose from which domain to prepare an additional spell for a particular spell level. See "Healer Domains," below, for descriptions of lesser and greater powers in each domain, as well as the lists of spells available to each domain.

Strider		KEY:Druid Path ~ Strider		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:The druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him, however. The druid also leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. He may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
Animal Companion	KEY:Druid Path ~ Animal Companion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, eagle, hawk, owl, pony, raven, snake (Small or Medium viper) or wolf. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted in the "Druid's Animal Companion" sidebar. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on Table 3-10. If a druid releases his companion from service, he may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished. A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see the "Alternative Animal Companions" sidebar). Should he select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated for the appropriate list from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on Table 3-10: Animal Companion Abilities by Master Level to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, he can't have that animal as a companion.)

Wild Shape		KEY:Druid Path ~ Wild Shape		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:The druid gains the ability to turn himself into a large raven or bird of prey. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until he changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. A druid loses his ability to speak while in animal form (because he is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make), but he can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as his new form. A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th and 18th level. In addition, he gains the ability to take the shape of a nightsaber cat at 8th level, a dire bear at 11th level, and an ancient at 15th level. (The nightsaber cat and the ancient are found in the Manual of Monsters.)
Dreamwalker		KEY:Druid Path ~ Dreamwalker		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:The druid may enter the Emerald Dream once per day, provided he is in a forested or wild area. This ability does not work in cities or blighted lands. Travel to and from the Emerald Dream functions like the spell plane shift. See "World of Warcraft" in the Introduction for a description of the Emerald Dream.
Group Stride	KEY:Druid Path ~ Group Stride		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:The druid can bestow the effects of the strider ability upon a number of beings of Small to Large size traveling with him.

Using the skill bestowed upon him by the spirits, the shaman can see into the spirit world and prophesy. He has the ability to cast the spell augury once per day as a spell-like ability; his caster level equals his shaman path level.
Flametongue/Frostbrand	KEY:Shaman Path ~ Flametongue/Frostbrand	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:A shaman learns to capture an elemental spirit within a weapon he wields. By sacrificing any prepared spell slot of 1st level or higher, a shaman can imbue a weapon with either the flaming or frost special weapon properties. A weapon cannot bear both elemental weapon properties at once, and it loses its special property if it leaves the shaman's hands. A shaman can imbue a weapon this way once per day. Doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The property lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + his Spirit modifier (minimum 1 round). This property can be suppressed for 1d4 rounds by a dispel magic targeted on the weapon. The shaman gains an additional use of this ability per day at 8th and 12th level.

The shaman can make a dispel check (1d20 + shaman's caster level, maximum +10) against any beneficial transmutation spell currently in effect on a target (e.g., bull's strength). The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If the shaman succeeds, the spell is dispelled; if he fails, the spell remains in effect, and the shaman cannot make another purge attempt against that specific spell (though he can attempt to dispel other transmutation spells in effect on a target, if any).
Rebirth			KEY:Shaman Path ~ Rebirth			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:By sacrificing a prepared spell slot of 5th level or higher, the shaman can bring a dead comrade back to life.

The slain comrade cannot have been dead for more than 8 hours and must have the same affiliation or alignment as the shaman. A shaman may do this once per day at 16th level and twice per day at 20th level.

For example, a hunter adopting the aspect of the monkey moves with a lanky stride, arms swinging, but when he adopts the aspect of the hawk he makes sudden movements and his keen eyes dart about. A hunter can choose to have no aspect active if he wishes.	DESC:&amp;nl:Aspect of the Monkey: The hunter gains evasion. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. The hunter can use evasion only if he is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless hunter (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.	DESC:&amp;nl:Aspect of the Hawk: The hunter easily perceives his opponents' vulnerabilities. He gains +1 insight bonus on ranged weapon damage rolls for every three hunter levels he possesses, to a maximum of +5 at 15th level.	DESC:&amp;nl:Aspect of the Beast: The hunter moves with the grace of an animal, allowing him to pass through natural terrain without leaving a trail and making him impossible to track. In addition, the hunter may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Magically manipulated thorns, briars and overgrown areas still affect him, however.	DESC:&amp;nl:Aspect of the Cheetah: The hunter mimics the cheetah's legendary swiftness. His base movement rate increases by 5 feet for every five hunter levels he possesses.	DESC:&amp;nl:Aspect of the Pack: The hunter reads his companions' movements with preternatural instinct, moving to support their attacks. When the hunter and an ally are both adjacent to an enemy, the ally is considered to be flanking that enemy.	DESC:&amp;nl:Aspect of the Wilds: The hunter becomes deeply in tune with nature, granting him protection from the world's dangers. He gains a +4 insight bonus on all saving throws.
Tame Animal				KEY:Hunter ~ Tame Animal				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 5th level, the hunter gains a supernatural bond with animals that allows him to interact with them on a spiritual level. A hunter may attempt to tame any animal whose Hit Dice are equal to or less than his hunter level minus two. (A 10th-level hunter can attempt to tame an animal with up to 8 Hit Dice, for instance.) The hunter uses both natural and supernatural means to compel the creature to become his ally. To do this, the hunter must be within 30 feet of the creature and they must be able to see and hear each other. The attempt takes one round per Hit Die of the target. At the end of this time, the hunter must make a Handle Animal check (DC 18 + the creature's Hit Dice + the creature's Charisma bonus). He takes a -2 penalty on this check for every creature in the area (including PCs) that appears threatening to the target. If the check fails, the creature's attitude toward the hunter does not change, but the hunter cannot attempt to tame that creature again for 24 hours. If the hunter succeeds, the creature becomes the hunter's companion, and gains several benefits (see "The Hunter's Companion" sidebar). A hunter can have only one such companion at a time, and can release it whenever he wishes. If his companion is slain or released, he cannot attempt to tame another for 24 hours. If the hunter wounds or threatens a creature, he cannot attempt to tame that creature for 24 hours. Once tamed, a creature is loyal to the hunter and, if the hunter treats it well, serves him faithfully.	BONUS:VAR|HunterCompanionLVL|HunterLVL	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Hunter Companion
Eagle Eye				KEY:Hunter ~ Eagle Eye					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 7th level, a hunter's sight improves. The range increments for all ranged weapons he wields increase by 150%%. (This ability stacks with the Far Shot feat.) He gains a +2 bonus on Spot checks, and his Spot checks take a -1 penalty for every 20 feet of distance between himself and the target, instead of -1 for every 10 feet (see Chapter 5: Skills).
Tame Magical Beast		KEY:Hunter ~ Tame Magical Beast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 14th level, the hunter can tame magical beasts just as he can tame animals; however, he takes a -4 penalty on his Handle Animal checks to do so.

Detect Undead			KEY:Paladin ~ Detect Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:A paladin can use detect undead, as the spell, at will.
Holy Strike				KEY:Paladin ~ Holy Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:Once per day, a paladin may attempt a holy strike with one normal melee attack. She must declare her intent to use holy strike before she makes her attack roll. If she hits, she deals 1d6 extra points of holy damage, +1 additional point of holy damage per paladin level. Her weapon is considered good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If the paladin misses with her holy strike, the strike has no effect but is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and at every 5 levels thereafter, the paladin may use holy strike one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 3-11: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.
Divine Grace			KEY:Paladin ~ Divine Grace				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma modifier on all saving throws.
Auras					KEY:Paladin ~ Auras					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin gains an aura. The Holy Light manifests around her in a tangible field and provides benefits to her and her allies. The aura extends from the paladin in a radius equal to 5 feet per point of Charisma modifier (minimum 5 feet) and affects the paladin and all allies within this area. Activating an aura is a free action, and the paladin can have only one aura active at a time. The aura lasts for one round per paladin level. At 3rd level, the paladin gains aura of might and can activate an aura once per day; she gains more auras and can activate them more often as she gains levels, as shown on Table 3??11. (The paladin's aura of good is persistent and does not count against her use of auras per day.) The paladin can also use a hero point to activate an aura that does not count against her auras per day. If she does so, the aura's radius doubles. When the paladin activates an aura, she can activate any aura she knows. For instance, a 6th-level paladin can activate an aura twice per day. In one day, she can activate a devotion aura twice, or an aura of might twice, or a devotion aura once and an aura of might once. When an aura is active, a colored glow wreathes the paladin and a circle of energy pulses at her feet. (The color depends on the aura.) Light of the same color dimly illuminates each affected ally. The aura provides shadowy illumination within its area. Some auras mimic spells of the same name; these auras' effects do not stack with the spells'.		DESC:&nl;Aura of Might: The paladin and her allies receive a +1 sacred bonus on damage rolls for every three paladin levels, to a maximum of +5 at 15th level.	DESC:&nl;Devotion Aura: The paladin and her allies receive a +1 deflection bonus to AC for every three paladin levels, to a maximum of +5 at 15th level.	DESC:&nl;Healing Aura: The paladin and her allies gain fast healing 1.	DESC:&nl;Retribution Aura: Any creature that deals damage with a melee attack to the paladin or one of her allies takes 2d4 points of holy damage, +1 point per the paladin's Charisma bonus (if any). The base damage increases to 3d4 at 15th level and 4d4 at 20th level.	DESC:&nl;Resistance Aura: The paladin and her allies gain spell resistance equal to 5 + the paladin's level.	DESC:&nl;Aura of Wisdom: Whenever the paladin or one of her allies casts a spell while within the aura, the paladin makes a Spirit check (DC 10 + twice the spell's level). If successful, the ally casts the spell but the spell slot is not expended. A natural roll of 5 or less on this check always fails.
Divine Health			KEY:Paladin ~ Divine Health				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.
Turn Undead				KEY:Paladin ~ Turn Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a priest of 3 levels lower would.
Lay on Hands			KEY:Paladin ~ Lay on Hands				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, the paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. This is a powerful ability that drains all of the paladin's remaining spell slots. The target heals a number of hit points equal to 5 per level of each spell slot lost in this way. For example, if the paladin used her lay on hands ability and lost one 3rd-level, two 2nd-level, and four 1st-level spell slots, she lost eleven spell slot levels. The target regains 55 hit points. Using lay on hands is a standard action. Alternatively, the paladin can use lay on hands to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin deals 5 points of holy damage per level of each spell slot lost. The undead creature may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + the paladin's level + the paladin's Charisma modifier) to halve the damage. If the paladin attempts to use lay on hands and misses, the ability has no effect. The paladin may try again in the next round
Spells				KEY:Paladin ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. To cast a spell, a paladin must have a Spirit score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Spirit modifier. Like other spellcasters, a paladin expends spell slots to cast her spells. Her base daily spell slots are given on Table 3-12: Paladin Spell Slots per Day. In addition, she receives bonus spell slots per day if she has a high Spirit score. When Table 3-12 indicates that the paladin gets 0 spell slots per day, she gains only the bonus spell slot to which she is entitled based on her Spirit score. Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.
Crusader Strike			KEY:Paladin ~ Crusader Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:At 5th level, a paladin can string together multiple holy strikes in a shining display  of holy fervor. If she hits a creature with more than one holy strike, each holy strike beyond the first deals additional damage equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) times the number of successful holy strikes against that creature. For example, Valdania is a 10th-level paladin with a Charisma of 17. If she hits a creature with two holy strikes, the second strike deals +3 extra damage. If she hits the same creature with a third holy strike, that strike deals +6 extra damage.
Fist of Justice			KEY:Paladin ~ Fist of Justice				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:At 7th level, a paladin gains Bash as a bonus feat and can use it with slashing or piercing weapons.
Code of Conduct			KEY:Paladin ~ Code of Conduct				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:A paladin must be of good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use her help for evil ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.
Associates				KEY:Paladin ~ Associates				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers or cohorts who are of good alignment.

###Block: Rogue
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Rogue ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.80	DESC:Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus hand cross-bows, saps, short-bows, short swords and warblades. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.
Backstab				KEY:Rogue ~ Backstab					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied its Agility bonus to AC (whether the target actually has an Agility bonus or not) or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a backstab, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as backstabs only if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a backstab that deals non-lethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal non-lethal damage in a backstab, not even with the usual -4 penalty. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to backstabs. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot backstab while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
Trapfinding				KEY:Rogue ~ Trapfinding					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a DC higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of at least 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.
Evasion				KEY:Rogue ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Trap Sense				KEY:Rogue ~ Trap Sense					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level. Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Rogue ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Agility bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Agility bonus to AC if immobilized. If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Rogue ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another rogue the ability to backstab the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Special Abilities			KEY:Rogue ~ Special Abilities				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:On attaining 3rd level, and at every three levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th and 18th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.
#
Crippling Strike			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Crippling Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:A rogue with this ability can backstab opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her backstabs also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day. The rogue may use this ability once per day for every three levels of rogue.
Finishing Strike			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Finishing Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:As a full attack action, a rogue can make an attack against a target, and then follow up that attack with a deadly blow. This combination strike requires that the first melee attack hits the target successfully and does damage. The rogue may then make a second attack, which is rolled using the rogue's normal attack bonus. If the second attack hits, the attack also deals backstab damage to the enemy. The finishing strike must be declared before the first attack roll is made. This may only affect creatures normally susceptible to backstabs. A rogue may perform a finishing strike once per day, and gains an additional use per day at 10th, 15th and 20th level.
Improved Evasion			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Improved Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:This ability works like evasion, except that the rogue henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
Opportunist				KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Opportunist					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round. Skill Mastery: The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, he selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his Intellect modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, he may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills to master each time.
Spell Stopper			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Spell Stopper				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:The rogue can attempt to interrupt a spell being cast by delivering a swift kick to the spellcaster in question. He must ready an action to interrupt a spell, or make an attack of opportunity against the spellcaster. While such an attack cannot deal backstab damage, the damage dealt is doubled for purposes of determining the DC of the spellcaster's Concentration check. The rogue may use this ability once per day for every three levels of rogue.
Sprint				KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Sprint					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:The rogue can move at a brisk pace, and still retain the ability to fight. A rogue with sprint adds +10 feet (2 squares) to his movement rate for every five levels of rogue the character possesses. The character may use sprint twice per day, and the ability lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to the character's Stamina modifier.
Stalk					KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Stalk						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:Remaining quiet and in hiding may be fine, but sometimes the rogue has to move and remain unseen. Stalking allows a rogue to travel past unaware sentries or other creatures. A rogue may use the stalk power a number of times per day equal to half his level. This ability has the same effects as invisibility with the following exceptions. The rogue must make a Stealth check with a DC equal to (10 + character level or Hit Dice + Spirit modifier + Intellect modifier) of any creature or person he stalks within 5 feet of in order to maintain his unseen presence. A rogue may stalk for as long as he wants, but he may not move faster than 10 feet per round while doing so. If the rogue moves faster than 10 feet or takes any action other than a free action while stalking, the rogue becomes visible. Rogues may not begin stalking while anyone within 30 feet is directly observing them.
Feat					KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Feat						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:A rogue may gain a feat in place of a special ability.

Wild Healing			KEY:Scout ~ Wild Healing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:At 2nd level, a scout with 5 ranks in Survival can use natural materials found in the wilderness to heal wounds. The scout makes a DC 15 Survival check representing 1 hour of searching for and preparing roots, rare leaves, berries and other such materials for a natural brew or poultice. Once the subject ingests or applies the concoction (as appropriate), the scout makes a DC 10 Heal check. The subject recovers 1 hit point for every point by which the result exceeds 10. Wild healing affects a single subject per attempt, and the same subject benefits from the concoction only once per day. In addition, the scout gains a +5 compe-tence bonus on the Heal check at 6th level. This bonus applies only to Heal checks made for wild healing, and increases by +5 for every four scout levels thereafter (+10 at 10th level, +15 at 14th level, +20 at 18th level).
Woodland Stride			KEY:Scout ~ Woodland Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 3rd level, a scout may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her, however.
Trackless Step			KEY:Scout ~ Trackless Step				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 4th level, a scout leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Scout ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a scout retains her Agility bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. She still loses her Agility bonus to AC if helpless, however. If a scout already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a scout with at least two levels of barbarian, for example), she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead (see below).
Trap Sense				KEY:Scout ~ Trap Sense					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 5th level, a scout gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. This bonus increases by +1 for every three scout levels thereafter (+2 at 8th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 14th, +5 at 17th and +6 at 20th).
Locate Object			KEY:Scout ~ Locate Object				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 6th level, the scout can cast locate object once per day as a spell-like ability, as if she were a divine spellcaster of her class level.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Scout ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Starting at 7th level, the scout can no longer be flanked; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies a rogue the ability to backstab the scout by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has scout levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Swift Tracker			KEY:Scout ~ Swift Tracker				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a scout can move at her normal speed while following tracks without taking the standard -5 penalty.

If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a burning hands spell), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the scout is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless scout (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.

This feat must be a technology feat (see Chapter 6: Feats), or it may be an Exotic Weapon Proficiency that allows the tinker to wield a technological weapon (with the exception of firearms). The tinker also receives a bonus feat at 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th and 20th). A tinker must meet all prerequisites for his bonus feats.
Packrat				KEY:Tinker ~ Packrat					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:Tinkers tend to carry about packs and pouches full of heavy tools, spare parts and inventions both finished and incomplete. In doing so, they quickly develop the ability to shoulder casually otherwise crushing burdens. A tinker of 2nd level or higher calculates his carrying capacity as if he possessed 5 bonus points of Strength.
Scavenge				KEY:Tinker ~ Scavenge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:A tinker of 2nd level or higher can put together devices out of random piles of spare parts or whatever wires and gears he happens to be carrying in his pockets at the time. A tinker who succeeds at a Search check with a DC equal to 15 + the intended device's overall Technology Score (TS) can gather random materials sufficient to substitute for raw materials equal to half the tinker's level x 50 gp.
Cobble				KEY:Tinker ~ Cobble					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:Tinkers prefer to spend days, weeks or even months constructing the devices they design. When adventuring, though, tinkers are often forced to throw together a device more quickly. A tinker of 3rd level or higher can make Craft (technological device) checks for progress on a device's construction once per hour, rather than the normal once per week (see Chapter 11 on the device construction process). However, after the device is complete, the device's Malfunction Rating is increased by +5. Further, it will continue to increase by +1 each time the device is operated, and no repair or upgrade can decrease it. At 3rd level, the tinker may use the cobble ability once per week. Each five levels thereafter (8th, 13th and 18th), the tinker may use the ability one additional time, to a maximum of four times at 18th level.
Bomb Bouncing			KEY:Tinker ~ Bomb Bouncing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 4th level, a tinker learns an esoteric technique developed by mad goblin tinkers and passed along to their brethren - the art of bomb throwing. When throwing a grenade-like weapon, a tinker with the bomb bouncing ability imparts a spin to the object that doubles the thrown object's range increment.
Evasion				KEY:Tinker ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a tinker gains the evasion ability and can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a tinker with the evasion ability makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a burning hands spell or an exploding phlogiston boiler), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the tinker is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless tinker (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Coolness Under Fire		KEY:Tinker ~ Coolness Under Fire			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 5th level, a tinker has employed his skills in dangerous situations often enough that he learns how to remain calm in combat even when operating complex controls or working to repair delicate machinery. Once per day, the tinker can take 10 on any roll that involves the construction, operation or repair of a technological device, even when circumstances would otherwise prevent it. This ability cannot be used for attack rolls, so the tinker cannot take 10 when operating a weapon such as a blunderbuss or a steam saw. For each two tinker levels achieved beyond 5th level, a tinker can use the coolness under fire ability one additional time per day, to a maximum of eight times per day at 19th level.
Energy Resistance			KEY:Tinker ~ Energy Resistance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:Tinkers are exposed to raw and powerful energies in the course of their work, and often develop a degree of resistance to one kind or another. Upon reaching 6th level, a tinker may select a single type of energy - acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic - and gain 5 points of resistance to that type of energy. Whenever the tinker would take damage of that energy type (whether from a natural or magical source), the damage is reduced by 5 points before being applied to the tinker's hit points. At 12th level, 16th level and 20th level, the tinker gains an additional 5 points of energy resistance. This resistance may be of the same type, or spread across multiple energy types. As it is not a supernatural or spell-like ability, a tinker's energy resistance stacks with resistance gained from spells such as protection from energy and resist energy.
Improved Evasion			KEY:Tinker ~ Improved Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:At 14th level, a tinker's evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a burning hands spell or exploding device, but henceforth he takes only half damage even on a failed save. As always, a helpless tinker (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

Bonus Feats				KEY:Warrior ~ Bonus Feats					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:At 1st level, a warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets (and the bonus feat granted to a human character). The warrior gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two warrior levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as warrior bonus feats (see Chapter 6: Feats). A warrior must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets when advancing levels. A warrior is not limited to the list of warrior bonus feats when choosing feats earned by advancing in level.

He does not gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.
High Arcana				KEY:Archmage of Kirin Tor ~ High Arcana					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archmage of Kirin Tor Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:An archmage gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those described below by permanently eliminating one existing spell slot (he cannot eliminate a spell slot of higher level than the highest-level spell he can cast). Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as specified in its description. An archmage may choose to eliminate a spell slot of a higher level than that required to gain a type of high arcana.
# High Arcana
Arcane Fire				KEY:High Arcana ~ Arcane Fire					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:High Arcana.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:The archmage gains the ability to change arcane spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/ level of archmage) that deals 1d6 points of damage per class level of the archmage plus 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell used to create the effect. This ability costs one 9thlevel spell slot.
Arcane Reach			KEY:High Arcana ~ Arcane Reach				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:High Arcana.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.92	DESC:The archmage can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 30 feet away. The archmage must make a ranged touch attack. Arcane reach can be selected a second time as a special ability, in which case the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.
Mastery of Counterspelling	KEY:High Arcana ~ Mastery of Counterspelling		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:High Arcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:When the archmage counterspells a spell, it is turned back upon the caster as if it were fully affected by a spell turning spell. If the spell cannot be affected by spell turning, then it is merely counterspelled. This ability costs one 7th-level spell slot.
Mastery of Energies		KEY:High Arcana ~ Mastery of Energies			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:High Arcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:The archmage can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different energy type from the one it normally uses. This ability can only alter a spell with the acid, cold, fire, electricity or sonic descriptor. The spell's casting time is unaffected. The caster decides whether to alter the spell's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting. This ability costs one 8th-level spell slot.
Mastery of Shaping		KEY:High Arcana ~ Mastery of Shaping			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:High Arcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:The archmage can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell's area or effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs one 6th-level spell slot.
Spell Power				KEY:High Arcana ~ Spell Power					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:High Arcana.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:This ability increases the archmage's effective caster level by +1 (for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables such as damage dice or range, and caster level checks only). This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot.
Spell-Like Ability		KEY:High Arcana ~ Spell-Like Ability			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:High Arcana.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.93	DESC:An archmage who selects this high arcana can use one of his arcane spell slots (other than a slot expended to learn this or any other type of high arcana) to permanently prepare one of his arcane spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The archmage does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs experience points to cast still does so and a spell with a costly material component instead costs 10 times that amount in experience points. This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot. The spell-like ability normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level, although the archmage can choose to make a spell modified by a metamagic feat into a spell-like ability at the appropriate spell level. The archmage may use an available higher-level spell slot in order to use the spell-like ability more often. Using a slot three levels higher than the chosen spell allows him to use the spell-like ability four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him use it six times per day. If spell-like ability is selected more than once as a high arcana choice, this ability can apply to the same spell chosen the first time (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

Backstab				KEY:Assassin ~ Backstab					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Assassin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th). If an assassin gets a backstab bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.
Death Attack			KEY:Assassin ~ Death Attack				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Assassin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a backstab with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the backstab has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal backstab. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.
Poison Use				KEY:Assassin ~ Poison Use				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Assassin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Assassins are trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.
Spells				KEY:Assassin ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Assassin Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to prepare and cast a limited number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, an assassin must have an Intellect score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intellect of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin spells are arcane and based on Intellect; saving throws against these spells have DCs of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intellect bonus. When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intellect score for that spell level. The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as an arcanist.
Save Bonus against Poison	KEY:Assassin ~ Save Bonus against Poison		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Assassin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:At 2nd level, the assassin gains a bonus on all saving throws against poisons; the bonus increases by +1 for every two additional assassin levels.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Assassin ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Assassin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.94	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, an assassin retains his Agility bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Agility bonus to AC if immobilized.) If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below). can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to backstab the assassin. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the assassin can flank him (and thus backstab him). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Hide in Plain Sight		KEY:Assassin ~ Hide in Plain Sight			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Assassin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.95	DESC:At 8th level, an assassin can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an assassin can hide himself from view in the open without actually having anything to hide behind. He cannot hide in his own shadow, however.

Wild Empathy			KEY:Beastmaster ~ Wild Empathy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Beastmaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:A beastmaster can use body language, vocalizations and demeanor to improve the attitude of any creature of the animal, magical beast or vermin types. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve a humanoid's attitude toward a character (see the Diplomacy skill in Chapter 5). Typically, domesticated creatures have a starting attitude of indifferent and wild creatures begin as unfriendly. Magical beasts may only be influenced by a beastmaster's wild empathy if the creature's Intellect score is 5 or less, and the beastmaster suffers a -4 penalty on any attempts to do so. The beastmaster rolls 1d20 + his beastmaster level + his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. To use wild empathy, the beastmaster and the creature must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another. A standard attempt to make a wild empathy check requires 1 minute, but as with influencing people, circumstances may require that the process take more or less time.
Charm Animal			KEY:Beastmaster ~ Charm Animal				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Beastmaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 2nd level, the beastmaster can use charm animal as a spell-like ability once per day.

At 7th level, the beastmaster extends his link to include not only his animal companion but also any animals he has befriended. The link allows the beastmaster and the animals to communicate their general emotional state (fear, hunger, happiness, curiosity) to one another. Note that the Intellect of animals may limit what the creatures can communicate or understand.
Natural Weaponry			KEY:Beastmaster ~ Natural Weaponry				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Beastmaster Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.96	DESC:At 4th level, a beastmaster can undertake a ritual that allows him to grow claws, fangs or horns. The ritual lasts for three days, during which the beastmaster cannot sleep or eat. At the end of the ritual, the player selects claws, fangs or horns; once the choice is made, it cannot be reversed or altered. Once a beastmaster has grown his chosen natural weaponry, it cannot be hidden easily and grants him a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks. The beastmaster is considered proficient with his chosen natural w e a p o n . W h e n m a k i n g multiple attacks in a full attack, a beastmaster suffers a -3 penalty if using his natural weapons in any attack beyond the first. A beastmaster who selects claws may make two attacks using the claws if he can make multiple attacks in the same round, but may not use them to attack while wielding another weapon. The damage for a beastmaster's natural weaponry is as follows: Character Claw Bite/Gore Size Damage Damage Small 1d3 1d4 Medium 1d4 1d6 Large 1d6 1d8 At 7th level, a beastmaster undergoes a longer and more involved ritual lasting five days without food or sleep, and he has the option either to select a second set of natural weaponry or to improve the natural weaponry he already possesses. If a new set of natural weaponry is selected, it is as if the beastmaster had selected it at 4th level. If the beastmaster chooses to improve his existing natural weaponry, it grows longer and more wicked than before. It grants a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks but also a -2 circumstance penalty on all checks requiring fine manipulation using the chosen body part. The damage for improved natural weaponry is as follows: Character Improved Improved Bite/ Size Claw Damage Gore Damage Small 1d4 1d6 Medium 1d6 1d8 Large 1d8 2d6 A beastmaster's natural weaponry may only be used if the beastmaster is wearing light armor or no armor.

The rancor ability further extends the power of the normal rage ability. A berserker with rancor who rages gains one additional attack per round and an additional +2 bonus to Strength and Stamina. The additional attack is at the berserker's base attack bonus -5. The berserker also suffers an additional -4 penalty to AC on top of that already in place due to the normal use of rage (-6 to AC total). A berserker has no choice in using rancor.

Burst of Speed			KEY:Berserk ~ Burst of Speed				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Berserk.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:When charging, the berserker can move an additional +5 feet (1 square) for every level of berserker. For each additional 5 feet a berserker moves while charging, he adds an additional +2 on the damage roll of his first attack if it is successful. Each time a berserker uses burst of speed, he suffers 1d4 points of Agility damage. This damage only takes effect once the rage has ended.
Fury					KEY:Berserk ~ Fury					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Berserk.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.98	DESC:Now the embodiment of unfettered rage, the berserker can lay to waste anything around him. While raging, and only while raging, the berserker can attack anything close to him. This ability functions the same as the Whirlwind Attack feat, but with the following exceptions. When in a fury, the berserker cannot discern between friend and foe; he must attack every target within reach, regardless of whether or not it is a friend or an opponent. Each time a berserker uses fury, he suffers 1d4 points of Stamina damage. This damage only takes effect once the rage has ended.

During a surge, he must attack up to a number of targets equal to his berserker level. He may not attack a target more than once during a surge. Each time a berserker uses surge, he suffers 1d4 points of Strength damage. This damage takes effect only once the rage ends.

Favored Enemy			KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Favored Enemy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 1st level, an elven ranger selects a type of creature as a favored enemy, chosen from among the creatures on Table 4-6. If the elven ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, she must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. Due to her extensive study of her chosen foe, the elven ranger gains a +2 competence bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot and Survival checks when using those skills against that type of creature. Likewise, due to practice with combat techniques effective against the creature, the elven ranger gets a +2 bonus on damage rolls against her favored enemy. When attacking a favored enemy within 30 feet using a ranged weapon, the elven ranger's damage bonus doubles to +4. This bonus does not apply to damage against creatures immune to critical hits. At 3rd level and every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th and 9th levels), the elven ranger selects another favored enemy from Table 4-6. In addition, each time a new favored enemy is selected, the competence bonus on skill checks against previously selected enemies increases by +2. Thus, at 5th level, an elven ranger will receive a +2 bonus on checks against the enemy chosen at 5th level, +4 against the enemy chosen at 3rd level, and +6 against the enemy chosen at 1st level. If a creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the bonuses do not stack; the elven ranger simply uses whichever bonus is higher.
Archery Combat Style		KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Archery Combat Style			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 1st level, the elven ranger receives the Rapid Shot feat as a special bonus feat. At 6th level, she gains Manyshot. At 10th level, she receives Improved Precise Shot. These bonus feats maybe used even if the elven ranger does not possess the prerequisites, but they may not be used as prerequisites for other feats or abilities unless all of their prerequisites have been met. Further, the elven ranger may make use of feats gained via the archery combat style only when wearing light or no armor.
Heightened Perception		KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Heightened Perception			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:The elven ranger's senses grow sharper than even those of other elves. The elven ranger may add a bonus equal to half her levels in the prestige class (fractions round down) on any Listen and Spot checks, except those against their favored enemies.
Woodland Stride			KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Woodland Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 2nd level, a n elven ranger may move through any sort of nonmagical undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and other similar terrain) at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
Keen Arrows				KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Keen Arrows				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:At 4th level, all arrows or bolts fired by the elven ranger gain the keen property if they do not already possess it, doubling their threat range; a normal arrow in the hands of a 5thlevel elven ranger has a threat range of 19-20/x2.
Swift Tracker			KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Swift Tracker				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:An elven ranger of 5th level or higher can move at her normal speed while following tracks without taking the standard -5 penalty. She takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the standard -20 penalty) when moving at up to twice her normal speed while tracking. If an elven ranger already possesses swift tracker from another class, these penalties are adjusted to -2 and -5 respectively.
Bow Strike				KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Bow Strike					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.101	DESC:Upon reaching 6th level, an elven ranger may use her bow in melee combat without risk of damaging the bow. A longbow does damage as a quarterstaff, and a shortbow does damage as a club. The bow's enhancement bonuses and masterwork quality do not grant any bonus on the attack.
Anticipation			KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Anticipation				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:After achieving 8th level, the elven ranger can notice the tiny movements of her enemies along with other visual and auditory cues that allow her to react more quickly in combat. This grants her a +4 competence bonus on all initiative checks. In addition, the elven ranger may select one creature each round; that creature may not make attacks of opportunity against or flank the elven ranger during that round.
Arrow Cleave			KEY:Elven Ranger ~ Arrow Cleave				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Elven Ranger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.102	DESC:A bow in the hands of a 10thlevel elven ranger becomes a weapon capable of shots with incredible power and precision. Whenever an elven ranger deals enough damage to a creature using an arrow, bolt or quarrel to drop the creature below 0 points, the ranger receives a second attack against another creature within half the weapon's range increment of the first target. If the second target is dropped below 0 points by the attack, the ranger may take a third attack against another creature within one-quarter of the weapon's range increment from the second target, and so on - the maximum distance between potential targets halving each time a target is successfully dropped.

When unarmored and wielding a melee weapon, the infiltrator may add 1 point of Intellect bonus (if any) per infiltrator class level to her AC. For example, a 2nd-level infiltrator with an Intellect of 16 (granting a +3 bonus) adds a +2 to her AC when wielding a sword; when she has advanced to 4th level, she gains a +3 bonus (the maximum allowed by her Intellect score, even though her infiltrator levels would allow another point). This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks, but not if the infiltrator is flat-footed or otherwise denied her Agility bonus.
Connections				KEY:Infiltrator ~ Connections					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Infiltrator Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.107	DESC:Infiltrators excel at what they do because of what they know, but also because of who they know, and they continually gather friends in high and low places across the land.

Roll 1d20 + infiltrator class level + Charisma bonus; the level of connection the infiltrator possesses in the area is based on the result of the roll: Connection Result Level Example 10 Low commoner City guard, apprentice 15 High commoner Captain of the guard, trader, merchant 20 Local noble City ruler, ambassador, merchant prince 25 Local legend Archmage, Lord Captain of the Knights of the Silver Hand 35 Famous legend Jaina Proudmoore, Thrall, Tyrande Whisperwind If the infiltrator is attempting to find a specific type of contact (for example, a jeweler rather than merely a merchant, or a necromancer rather than simply an arcanist), the DC of the check rises by +5. However, 5 or more ranks in an appropriate Knowledge skill will provide a +2 synergy bonus - Knowledge (religion), for instance, will help the infiltrator if she seeks a priest, but will do no good if she seeks the captain of the guard.

This defense denies a rogue the ability to backstab the infiltrator by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the infiltrator has levels in the prestige class.

If an infiltrator with the slippery mind ability is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she may attempt an additional saving throw each subsequent round until she makes a number of attempts equal to her Spirit modifier.

The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total concealment (50%% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense.

Blindsight					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Vision	DEFINE:BlindsightRange|0	DESC:Range %1 ft.;|BlindsightRange|PREVARGTEQ:BlindsightRange,1	DESC:The creature has blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination of such senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such sense may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This ability makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can't see ethereal creatures and must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature description. The creature usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature's description. If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.&nl;Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight.&nl;Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).&nl;Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures using blindsight.&nl;Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.&nl;Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.&nl;Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.|BlindsightRange	VISION:Blindsight (BlindsightRange)			ASPECT:Vision|Blindsight %1 ft.|BlindsightRange

Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. If no straight path exists through the ground from the creature to those that it's sensing, then the range defines the maximum distance of the shortest indirect path. It must itself be in contact with the ground, and the creatures must be moving. As long as the other creatures are taking physical actions, including casting spells with somatic components, they're considered moving; they don't have to move from place to place for a creature with tremorsense to detect them.|TremorsenseRange																																																																																																																															VISION:Tremorsense (TremorsenseRange)		ASPECT:Vision|Tremorsense %1 ft.|TremorsenseRange

# Ability Name		Unique Key					Category of Ability		Type										Define									Description																																																																																																																																																																																																									Source Page
Crush				KEY:Dragon ~ Crush			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality													DESC:This special attack allows a flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size to land on opponents as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents). A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon's body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Grappling: Dragons do not favor grapple attacks, though their crush attack (and Snatch feat, if they know it) use normal grapple rules. A dragon can always use its breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on Concentration checks.	SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Tail Sweep			KEY:Dragon ~ Tail Sweep			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality													DESC:This special attack allows a dragon of at least Gargantuan size to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Breath Weapon		KEY:Dragon ~ Breath Weapon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Breath Weapon	DEFINE:BreathWeaponLine|0	DEFINE:BreathWeaponCone|0	DESC:Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If a dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice, with an area as noted on the table below. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon's age and variety, and is given in each individual entry. Saves against nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC; the kind of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Con modifier. Breath weapons come in two basic shapes, line and cone, whose areas vary with the dragon's size.

Frightful Presence	KEY:Dragon ~ Frightful Presence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality													DESC:A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet x the dragon's age category are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the dragon. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Cha modifier) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.

Spell-Like Abilities	KEY:Dragon ~ Spell-Like Abilities	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality															DESC:A dragon's spelllike abilities depend on its age and variety. It gains the abilities indicated for its age plus all previous ones. Its age category or its sorcerer caster level, whichever is higher, is the caster level for these abilities. The save DC is 10 + dragon's Cha modifier + spell level. All spell-like abilities are usable once per day unless otherwise noted.																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Damage Reduction		KEY:Dragon ~ Damage Reduction		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality															DESC:Young adult and older dragons have damage reduction.

SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Spell Resistance		KEY:Dragon ~ Spell Resistance		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality													DESC:As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the variety descriptions.																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.69	SR:DragonSpellResistance	DEFINE:DragonSpellResistance|0
Blindsense			KEY:Dragon ~ Blindsense			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality													DESC:Dragons can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet.

All these skills are considered class skills for dragons. (Each dragon has other class skills as well, as noted in the variety descriptions.)																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.69
Feats				KEY:Dragon ~ Feats			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RaceAbility.SpecialQuality															DESC:All dragons have one feat, plus an additional feat per 3 Hit Dice, just like any other creature.
