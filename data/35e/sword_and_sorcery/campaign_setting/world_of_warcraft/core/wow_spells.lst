###Block: Full Descriptive Text
Acid Fog.MOD	DESC:Acid fog creates a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to that produced by a solid fog spell. In addition to slowing creatures down and obscuring sight, this spell's vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature and object within it. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.
Acid Splash.MOD	DESC:You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage.
Alarm.MOD	DESC:Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible. Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental "ping" that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm. Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing. Incorporeal creatures do not trigger the alarm. Alarm can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Arcane Focus: A tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire.
Alter Self.MOD	DESC:You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form. The new form must be within one size category of your normal size. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself. You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus and base save bonuses all remain the same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or eyes for a gaze attack). You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any from your normal form that are not derived from class levels. If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components. You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent and so forth. You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype. You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check. When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its true form.
Animal Growth.MOD	DESC:A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight. This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Stamina (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to Agility. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by +2. The size change also affects the animal's size modifier to AC and attack rolls and its base damage. The animal's space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change (see Table 12-4: Creature Size and Scale). The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it - the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size. All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size. The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.
Animal Shapes.MOD	DESC:As polymorph, except you polymorph up to one willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a fullround action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone. The maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to the subject's HD or your caster level, whichever is lower, to a maximum of 20 HD at 20th level.
Animate Dead.MOD	DESC:This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletal warriors or zombies that follow your spoken commands. The undead can follow you, or they can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie cannot be animated again.) Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you cannot create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of animate dead. The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. (You choose which creatures are released.) If you are a priest, any undead you might command by virtue of your power to command or rebuke undead do not count toward the limit. Skeletal Warrior: A skeletal warrior can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeletal warrior is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. (The skeletal warrior is found in the Manual of Monsters.) Zombies: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a true anatomy. Material Component: You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse you intend to animate. The magic of the spell turns these gems into  worthless, burned-out shells.
Animate Plants.MOD	DESC:You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category. You may animate one Large or smaller plant, or an equivalent number of larger plants, per 3 caster levels. A Huge plant counts as 2 Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as 4, and a Colossal plant as 8. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. Use the statistics for animated objects, except that plants smaller than Large usually don't have hardness. Animate plants cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material. Entangle: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an entangling roots spell. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from being entangled. This effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.
Antilife Shell.MOD	DESC:You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures. The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders or undead. This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.
Antimagic Field.MOD	DESC:An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell's duration. Summoned creatures of any type and incorporeal undead wink out if they enter an antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast antimagic field in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's spell resistance to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an antimagic field because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.) A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter selfsupporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities, however, may be temporarily nullified by the field. Dispel magic does not remove the field. Two or more antimagic fields sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as wall of force, remain unaffected by antimagic field (see the individual spell descriptions). Artifacts and Eternals are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.
Antipathy.MOD	DESC:You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named. Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Agility score by -4 points.
Arcane Intellect.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Intellect, adding the usual benefits to Intellect-based skill checks and other uses of the Intellect modifier. Arcanists (and other spellcasters who rely on Intellect) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spell slots or prepared spells for the increased Intellect, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase. This spell does not grant extra skill points. Arcane Material Component: A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a fox.
Arcane Mark.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If you make an invisible mark, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable. See invisibility or true seeing likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster. If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.
Arcane Missile.MOD	DESC:A missile of arcane energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage. The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. You cannot single out specific parts of a creature. This spell does not damage inanimate objects. For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile - two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.
Atonement.MOD	DESC:This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your faith or Eternal (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden. Many casters first assign a subject of this sort a quest (see geas/quest) or similar penance to determine whether the creature is truly contrite before casting the atonement spell on its behalf. Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected. Reverse Magical Alignment Change: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no cost in experience points. Restore Class: A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell. Restore Healer Spell Powers: A healer who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of his or her faith or Eternal may regain that ability by seeking atonement from another healer of the same faith or Eternal. If the transgression was intentional, the casting healer loses 500 XP for his intercession. If the transgression was unintentional, he does not lose experience points. Redemption or Temptation: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally. Though the spell description refers to evil acts, atonement can also be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, whether those acts are evil, good, chaotic or lawful. Note: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement simply offers a believable way for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly and definitively. Material Component: Burning incense. Focus: In addition to your holy symbol or normal divine focus, you need a set of prayer beads (or other prayer device, such as a prayer wheel or prayer book) worth at least 500 gp. XP Cost: When cast for the benefit of a creature whose guilt was the result of deliberate acts, the cost to you is 500 XP per casting (see above).
Augury.MOD	DESC:An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%% + 1%% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%%; this roll is made secretly by the GM. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results: * Weal (if the action will probably bring good results). * Woe (for bad results). * Weal and woe (for both). * Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results). If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result. A shaman who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury. The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting. Material Component: Incense worth at least 25 gp. Focus: A set of marked sticks, bones or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value.
Avatar.MOD	DESC:Upon casting this spell, you become a fighting avatar of your ideals. Your skin, clothing and all your possessions become a dimly luminous silver-gray. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat. You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +6 enhancement bonus to Stamina, and a +2 enhancement bonus to Agility. You gain a +8 enhancement bonus to natural armor and spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level. You are considered proficient with all simple and martial weapons. You double in height and increase in weight by a factor of 10. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +4 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Agility (negating the enhancement bonus noted above), and a -1 size penalty on attack rolls and AC due to your increased size. A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change your speed. If insufficient room is available for the growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using your increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you - the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size. All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves the your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell. Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack. Material Component: A chunk of adamantine worth at least 500 gp.
Baleful Polymorph.MOD	DESC:As polymorph, except that you change the target into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature, the target gets a +4 bonus on the save. If the spell succeeds, the target must also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the alignment, special abilities and Intellect, Spirit and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving from it (such as base attack bonus, base save bonuses and hit points). It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that are not extraordinary, supernatural or spell-like abilities. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.
Bane.MOD	DESC:Bane fills your enemies with fear and doubt. Each affected creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and a -1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Bane counters and dispels bless.
Banish.MOD	DESC:The target becomes incorporeal - invisible and intangible - for the spell's duration, unable to interact with the material world in any way until the duration ends. The caster can still see her, although he cannot affect her with further spells unless he also becomes incorporeal. The effects of being incorporeal are described in Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions.
Banishment.MOD	DESC:A banishment spell is a more powerful version of the dismissal spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 HD of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any), and the saving throw DC increases by +2. Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by +4). Arcane Focus: Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above).
Bear's Endurance.MOD	DESC:The affected creature gains greater vitality and endurance. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Stamina, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Stamina checks and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Stamina score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Stamina drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.
Bear's Endurance (Mass).MOD	DESC:Mass bear's endurance works like bear 's endurance, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Bestow Curse.MOD	DESC:You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following three effects. * -6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1). * -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks and skill checks. * Each turn, the target has a 50%% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action. You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse or wish spell. Bestow curse counters remove curse.
Bladestorm.MOD	DESC:Your arms change into two longswords. Each longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 per three caster levels (maximum +5) on attack and damage rolls. The caster gains the Whirlwind Attack feat. If the caster does not make a full attack each round, the effect ends. You do not suffer penalties for fighting with two weapons when using these transmuted longswords. The caster is considered proficient with the longsword for the duration of the spell. Material	COMPS:Two unenchanted knives, one for each hand. They meld with the caster's arms and are lost when the spell ends.
Blade Barrier.MOD	DESC:An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage. If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save. A blade barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.
Blasphemy.MOD	DESC:Any nonevil creature within the area of a blasphemy spell suffers the following ill effects. Hit Dice Effect Equal to caster level Dazed Up to caster level -1 Weakened, dazed Up to caster level -2 Paralyzed, weakened, dazed Up to caster level -10 Killed, paralyzed, weakened, dazed The effects are cumulative and concurrent. No saving throw is allowed against these effects. Dazed: The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it defends itself normally. Weakened: The creature's Strength score decreases by -2d6 points for 2d4 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the blasphemy. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a -4 penalty) to negate. Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by blasphemy.
Blazing Column.MOD	DESC:You call down a column of roaring fire. The column deals 1d6 points of fire damage for every two caster levels (maximum 5d6) each round for the first 3 rounds, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage each round for the following 3 rounds. The column is stationary. Material Component: A bit of brimstone and a drop of your blood (or whatever passes for blood).
Bless.MOD	DESC:Bless fills your allies with courage. Each ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects. Bless counters and dispels bane.
Blindness/Deafness.MOD	DESC:You call upon the powers of unlife to render the target blinded or deafened, as you choose.
Blizzard.MOD	DESC:This spell calls freezing sleet, ice shards and hail down upon the caster's enemies, dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage each round. Material Component: Crushed glass and a few drops of water.
Bloodlust.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects. When making a full attack, a bloodlusted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects; nor does the creature actually gain an extra action, so you cannot use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A bloodlusted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Agility bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. All of the bloodlusted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly and swim) increase by +30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. The transmuted creatures are also imbued with extra strength. The spell grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier. Bloodlust is dispelled and countered by cripple. Material Component: A drop of blood mingled with earth.
Break Enchantment.MOD	DESC:This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations and curses. Break enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25. If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel magic, break enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, break enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects.
Brilliance Aura.MOD	DESC:You surround yourself with a pulsing aura of cerulean energy. This aura grants crystalline thought to all friendly spellcasters around you and empowers them to cast their spells without actually losing spell slots. Whenever an ally (including you) casts a spell while within the aura, she may make a Spellcraft check (DC 30 + twice the spell's level). If successful, she casts the spell but the spell slot is not expended. A natural roll of 5 or less on this check always fails.
Bull's Strength.MOD	DESC:The subject becomes stronger. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls and other uses of the Strength modifier. Arcane Material Component: A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a bull.
Bull's Strength (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like bull's strength, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Burning Hands.MOD	DESC:A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips. Any creature in the area of the flames takes 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4). Flammable materials burn if the flames touch them. A character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action.
Call of the Spirits.MOD	DESC:You beseech the surrounding spirits to help you on a specific task. Upon casting this spell, you declare one specific die roll that you expects to make within the duration of the spell (for example, "My first attempt to strike Baelzor the Defiler with my mace" or "My first attempt to save against the red dragon's breath weapon"). If you make that die roll before the spell's duration expires, the spirits grant you a +5 bonus on the roll. Note that this is an unnamed bonus, and therefore stacks with all others. You may only have one call of the spirits spell active at any one time. Subsequent castings replace earlier ones.
Cannibalize.MOD	DESC:The caster gains some of the traits of a ghoul, especially the creature's bone-cracking jaw and extended tongue. The caster may consume flesh from a corpse to regain health. This spell works only on dead creatures and heals only the caster. The corpse must be mostly intact and must have a true anatomy (e.g., the caster cannot cannibalize oozes). By consuming the corpse's flesh, the caster regains 1d8 hit points per round of concentration, up to his maximum number of hit points. Once a corpse has been consumed, very little flesh remains and the corpse is no longer considered intact. A corpse can thus be the target of this spell only once.
Carrion Swarm.MOD	DESC:A swarm of bats, poisonous spiders, flying beetles and other such vermin extends out from your hand to bite and savage your opponents. This swarm of vermin causes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). The damage is nonmagical, piercing and bludgeoning. Carrion swarm is ineffective against incorporeal creatures. Material Component: A dead beetle, spider or other vermin.
Cat's Grace.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Agility, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves and other uses of the Agility modifier. Material Component: A pinch of cat fur.
Cause Fear.MOD	DESC:The affected creature becomes frightened. If the target succeeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round. Creatures with 6 HD or more are immune to this effect. Cause fear counters and dispels remove fear.
Chain Lightning.MOD	DESC:This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did (rounded down). Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum. Focus: A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass or a crystal rod; plus one silver pin for each of your caster levels.
Charm Animal.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like charm person, except that it affects a creature of the animal type.
Charm Monster.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like charm person, except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or size.
Charm Person.MOD	DESC:This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it would not ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.
Circle of Death.MOD	DESC:A circle of death snuffs out the life force of living creatures, killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first; among creatures with equal Hit Dice, those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No creature of 9 HD or more can be affected, and Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Material Component: The powder of a crushed black pearl with a minimum value of 500 gp.
Clairaudience/Clairvoyance.MOD	DESC:Clairaudience/clairvoyance creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You do not need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known - a place familiar to you, or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor does not move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. Clairaudience/clairvoyance functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying. Focus: A small horn (for hearing) or a glass eye (for seeing).
Commune with Nature.MOD	DESC:You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting. In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings - caves, caverns and the like - the radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.
Comprehend Languages.MOD	DESC:You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it. You can read written material at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. You cannot read magical writing, though this spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic; it does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text. Comprehend languages can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Arcane Material Component: A pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.
Cone of Cold.MOD	DESC:Cone of cold creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Arcane Material Component: A very small crystal or glass cone.
Confusion.MOD	DESC:This spell causes the targets to become confused, making them unable to independently determine what they do. Roll on the following table at the beginning of each target's turn each round to see what the target does in that round. d%% Behavior 01-10 Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible). 11-20 Act normally. 21-50 Do nothing but babble incoherently. 51-70 Flee away from caster at top possible speed. 71-100 Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self). A confused character who cannot carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused character does not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). Arcane Material Component: A set of three nut shells.
Contagion.MOD	DESC:The target contracts a disease selected from the table below, which strikes immediately (no incubation period). The DC noted is for the subsequent saves (use contagion's normal save DC for the initial saving throw). Disease DC Damage Blinding sickness 16 1d4 Str* Cackle fever 16 1d6 Spt Filth fever 12 1d3 Agy and 1d3 Sta Red ache 15 1d6 Str Shakes 13 1d8 Agy Slimy doom 14 1d4 Sta * Each time a victim takes 2 or more points of Strength damage from blinding sickness, he must make another Fortitude save (using the disease's save DC) or be permanently blinded.
Contingency.MOD	DESC:You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting contingency. You cast the contingency spell and the companion spell at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. The spell to be brought into effect by the contingency must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level). The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the contingency immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being "cast" instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If you prescribe complicated or convoluted conditions, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You can use only one contingency spell at a time; if you cast a second, the first one (if still active) is dispelled. Material Component: That of the companion spell, plus quicksilver and an eyelash of an ogre mage or similar spell-using creature. Focus: A statuette of you carved from elephant ivory and decorated with gems (worth at least 1,500 gp). You must carry the focus for the contingency to work.
Control Plants.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior. Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.
Control Undead.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to command undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior. Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them. Material Component: A small piece of bone and a small piece of raw meat.
Control Water.MOD	DESC:Depending on the version you choose, the control water spell raises or lowers water. Lower Water: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level x 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other waterbased creatures, the creature is chilled for the duration of the spell (Will negates, see Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions). The spell has no effect on other creatures. Raise Water: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the lower water version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land. With either version, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension.
Control Weather.MOD	DESC:You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. Season Possible Weather Spring Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm or hot weather Summer Torrential rain, heat wave or hailstorm Autumn Hot or cold weather, fog or sleet Winter Frigid cold, blizzard or thaw Late winter Hurricane-force winds or early spring (coastal area) You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather - where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously. Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them. A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 3-mile radius.
Create Greater Undead.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like create undead, except that the caster can create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: wraiths, skeletal mages, banshees and shades. The type or types of undead she can create are based on her caster level, as shown on the table below. Caster Level Undead Created 15th or lower Wraith 16th−17th Skeletal mage 18th−19th Banshee 20th or higher Shade
Create Undead.MOD	DESC:A much more potent spell than animate dead, this evil spell allows the caster to create more powerful sorts of undead: crypt fiends, ghouls, withered creatures and ghosts. The type or types of undead the caster can create are based on his caster level, as shown on the table below. Caster Level Undead Created 11th or lower Crypt fiend 12th−14th Ghoul 15th−17th Withered creature 18th or higher Ghost* * Ghosts created with this spell possess the malevolence, horrific appearance and corrupting gaze abilities. The caster may create less powerful undead than his level would allow if he chooses. Created undead are not automatically under the control of the animator. If the caster is capable of commanding undead, he may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms. This spell must be cast at night. Material Component: A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled with brackish water. The spellcaster must cast this spell on a dead body, and he must place a black onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per Hit Die of the undead to be created into the mouth or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless shells.
Cripple.MOD	DESC:The target can take only a single move or standard action each round. Additionally, it suffers a -2 penalty to AC and on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and Reflex saves. The affected creature jumps half as far as normal. Additionally, the affected creature suffers a -1d6 penalty to Strength, with an additional -1 per two caster levels (maximum additional penalty of -5). The target's Strength score cannot drop below 1. Cripple is countered and dispelled by bloodlust.
Cure Critical Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
Cure Critical Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass cure light wounds, except that it cures 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +40).
Cure Light Wounds.MOD	DESC:When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
Cure Light Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:You channel positive energy to cure 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +25) in each selected creature. Like other cure spells, mass cure light wounds deals damage to undead in its area rather than curing them. Each affected undead may attempt a Will save for half damage.
Cure Minor Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures only 1 point of damage.
Cure Moderate Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).
Cure Moderate Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass cure light wounds, except that it cures 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +30).
Cure Serious Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like cure light wounds, except that it cures 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15).
Cure Serious Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass cure light wounds, except that it cures 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +35).
Dark Metamorphosis.MOD	DESC:The caster transforms into a fearsome, black, demonlike creature. Long horns sprout from her head and wings grow from her back. The caster's skin and all her belongings become void-black, and her only facial features are two glowing, slit-like red eyes. She gains fast healing 3, damage reduction 10/good and silver, a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Stamina, and a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor. In addition, the caster may cast orb of annihilation each round as a standard action; this counts as her spellcasting action for the round. Material Component: A vial of demon blood, which the caster drinks.
Darkness.MOD	DESC:This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area gain concealment (20%% miss chance). Even creatures that can normally see in such conditions (such as with darkvision or low-light vision) have the miss chance in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns and so forth) are incapable of brightening the area, as are light spells of lower level. Higher-level light spells are not affected by darkness. If darkness is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed. Darkness counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower spell level. Arcane Material Component: A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a piece of coal.
Death and Decay.MOD	DESC:Negative energy infuses the area in visible puffs. Living creatures age rapidly, as skin sags and flesh sloughs off bones. Structures wither and collapse, suffering the effects of decades within a few seconds. All living creatures and non-natural structures in the area take 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d4) per round from negative energy. Creatures are allowed Fortitude saving throws to halve the damage. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures them a like amount of damage. Material Component: A dead rose.
Death Coil.MOD	DESC:A coil of negative energy projects out from your extended palm and unerringly strikes its target. The coil deals 2d8 points of negative energy damage +1 point per caster level (up to +10) to living creatures; a successful Will save halves the damage. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures them of a like amount of damage, rather than harming them.
Death Coil (Greater).MOD	DESC:As death coil, except that it deals 3d8 points of negative energy damage +1 point per caster level (up to +15).
Death Coil (Lesser).MOD	DESC:As death coil, except that it deals 1d8 points of negative energy damage +1 point per caster level (up to +5).
Death Pact.MOD	DESC:The target undead, which must be under the caster's control, crumbles to dust. The caster regains 1 hit point for each hit point the undead creature had remaining, up to his normal maximum. The caster loses control of the undead target if its Will save is successful.
Deeper Darkness.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like darkness, except that the object radiates shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius and the darkness lasts longer. Daylight brought into an area of deeper darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Deeper darkness counters and dispels any light spell of equal or lower level, including daylight and light.
Delay Poison.MOD	DESC:The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. Delay poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done.
Demand.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like sending, but the message can also contain a suggestion (see the suggestion spell), which the target does its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the suggestion effect but not the contact itself. The demand, if received, is understood even if the target's Intellect score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand is issued, the message is understood but the suggestion is ineffective. The demand's message to the creature must be twentyfive words or less, including the suggestion. The creature can also give a short reply immediately. Material Component: A short piece of copper wire and some small part of the subject - a hair, a bit of nail or the like.
Demon Skin.MOD	DESC:The caster of demon skin surrounds himself in a living sheet of scales and leathery skin that protects him from harm. The demon skin itself melds with the caster's body, diverting damage and protecting the caster with thick sheets of scales. The caster of the spell gains a +3 enhancement bonus to natural armor, and 18 temporary hit points. Material Component: A ground fel stalker tooth.
Demon Skin (Greater).MOD	DESC:As demon skin, except that the caster gains a +6 enhancement bonus to natural armor and 32 temporary hit points. Material Component: A lock of hair from a succubus.
Demon Skin (Lesser).MOD	DESC:As demon skin, except that the caster gains a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor and 6 temporary hit points. Material Component: Ground imp wings.
Detect Chaos.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that it detects the auras of chaotic creatures, healers of chaotic Eternals or faiths, chaotic spells and chaotic magic items; you are vulnerable to an overwhelming chaotic aura if you are lawful.
Detect Evil.MOD	DESC:You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of evil. 2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming (see below), and the Hit Dice or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Power: An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its Hit Dice, caster level, or (in the case of a healer) class level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two. - Aura Power - Creature/ Over- Object Faint Moderate Strong whelming Evil creature* 10 or 11-25 26-50 51 or (HD) lower higher Undead (HD) 2 or 3-8 9-20 21 or lower higher Evil outsider 1 or 2-4 5-10 11 or (HD) lower higher Healer of an 1 2-4 5-10 11 or evil Eternal* higher (class levels) Evil magic 2nd or 3rd-8th 9th- 21st or itemor spell lower 20th higher (caster level) * Except for undead and outsiders, which have their own entries on the table. ** Some characters who are not healers may radiate an aura of equivalent power. The class description will indicate whether this applies. Lingering Aura: An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If detect evil is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6 x 10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Animals, traps, poisons and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them. Each round, you can turn to detect evil in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Good.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that it detects the auras of good creatures, healers or paladins of good Eternals or faiths, good spells and good magic items; you are vulnerable to an overwhelming good aura if you are evil. Healing potions, antidotes and similar beneficial items are not good.
Detect Law.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like detect evil, except that it detects the auras of lawful creatures, healers of lawful Eternals or faiths, lawful spells and lawful magic items; you are vulnerable to an overwhelming lawful aura if you are chaotic.
Detect Magic.MOD	DESC:You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras. 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.) Magical areas, multiple types of magic or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras. Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two. - Aura Power - Spell/ Over- Object Faint Moderate Strong whelming Functioning 3rd or 4th- 7th- 10th+ spell lower 6th 9th (Eternal-level) (spell level) Magic item 5th or 6th- 12th- 21st+ (caster level) lower 11th 20th (artifact) Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6x10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves; but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Detect Poison.MOD	DESC:You determine whether a creature, object or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Spirit check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check if the Spirit check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the Spirit check. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Scrying.MOD	DESC:You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area. If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his or her direction and distance from you. Material Component: A small piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet.
Detect Snares and Pits.MOD	DESC:You can detect simple pits, deadfalls and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps. Detect snares and pits does detect certain natural hazards - quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall or snaring; see the spell snare), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of hazards. 2nd Round: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Each Additional Round: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Detect Thoughts.MOD	DESC:You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or target. 1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with Intellect scores of 1 or higher). 2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the Intellect score of each. If the highest Intellect is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intellect score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you cannot see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting. 3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's successful Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (Int 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts that you can pick up. Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Arcane Focus: A copper piece.
Detect Undead.MOD	DESC:You can detect the aura that surrounds undead creatures. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area. 1st Round: Presence or absence of undead auras. 2nd Round: Number of undead auras in the area and the strength of the strongest undead aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest undead aura's strength is overwhelming (see below), and the creature has Hit Dice of at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: The strength and location of each undead aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location. Aura Strength: The strength of an undead aura is determined by the Hit Dice of the undead creature, as given on the following table: HD Strength 1 or lower Faint 2-4 Moderate 5-10 Strong 11 or higher Overwhelming Lingering Aura: An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed. If detect undead is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: Original Strength Duration of Lingering Aura Faint 1d6 rounds Moderate 1d6 minutes Strong 1d6 x 10 minutes Overwhelming 1d6 days Each round, you can turn to detect undead in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
Dimension Door.MOD	DESC:You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired - whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you cannot take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight does not exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.
Dimensional Anchor.MOD	DESC:A green ray springs from your outstretched hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a dimensional anchor include dimension door, gate, plane shift, spiritual projection, teleport and similar spells or spelllike abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a gate for its duration. A dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in incorporeal form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, dimensional anchor does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
Discern Lies.MOD	DESC:Each round, you concentrate on one target, who must be within range. You know if the target deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying. The spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies or necessarily reveal evasions. Each round, you may concentrate on a different target.
Discern Location.MOD	DESC:A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a mind blank spell or the direct intervention of an Eternal keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent and the plane of existence where the target lies. To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once.
Disguise Self.MOD	DESC:You make yourself - including clothing, armor, weapons and equipment - look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your body type. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.
Dismissal.MOD	DESC:This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane if it fails a special Will save (DC = spell's save DC - creature's HD + your caster level). If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is a 20%% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.
Dispel Magic.MOD	DESC:You can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, cannot be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration cannot be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell: Targeted Dispel: One object, creature or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: a suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and Eternals are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. Area Dispel: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the dispel magic spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the dispel magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area. If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object. You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. Counterspell: When dispel magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, dispel magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.
Dispel Magic (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like dispel magic, except that the maximum caster level on your dispel check is +20 instead of +10. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic cannot dispel that effect.
Disrupt Undead.MOD	DESC:You direct a ray of positive energy. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit; if the ray hits an undead creature, it deals 1d6 points of damage to it.
Divination.MOD	DESC:Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70%% + 1%% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%%. If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work. As with augury, multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first divination spell and yield the same answer each time. Material Component: Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp.
Dominate Animal.MOD	DESC:You can enchant an animal and direct it with simple commands such as "Attack," "Run" and "Fetch." Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored. Dominate animal establishes a mental link between you and the target creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the creature to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't do. Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.
Dominate Monster.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like dominate person, except that the spell is not restricted by creature type.
Dominate Person.MOD	DESC:You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the target's mind. If you and the target have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight" and "Stand still." You know what the target is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the target's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description). Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the target, though it still cannot communicate with you. You cannot actually see through the target's eyes, so it is not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what is going on. Targets resist this control, and any target forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the target to control it. If you do not spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the target receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. Protection from evil or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the target is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of domination nor dispels it.
Doom.MOD	DESC:This spell fills a single target with a feeling of horrible dread that causes it to become shaken (see Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions).
Drain Life.MOD	DESC:Gouts of blood erupt from a victim's eyes, nose and mouth. The streams spin and twist into a single, larger, rope-like stream as they bridge the gap between the caster and the target. The caster opens her mouth and draws in the stream, gaining vitality as the target weakens. The target takes 1 point of Stamina damage per round beginning on the round the spell is cast. The caster regains 5 hit points per point of Stamina the spell drains from the target. If you or the target moves out of range, the spell ends. If an object at least 5 feet wide and 5 feet high blocks the line of sight, the spell ends. Creatures of Medium size or smaller do not block the stream, but Large creatures generally do.
Drain Soul.MOD	DESC:A cunning warlock can draw the very soul out of a creature using deadly magic. The life essence of anyone slain by this spell coalesces into a soul shard, a precious, ruby-colored gem used in creating soulstones. When cast upon a living target, drain soul causes 1d10 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level. If the spell slays the target, its vital essence begins to coalesce into a soulstone. The caster of the spell must then mold the essence into a soul shard before it flees for the afterlife, paying the experience cost for the spell only if the target is slain; the caster is then rewarded with a soul shard. Those slain by drain soul can still be returned to life by raise dead, resurrection or other means. This in no way affects the soul shard. XP Cost: 750 XP.
Entangling Roots.MOD	DESC:Grass and weeds entwine about the target's legs, holding it fast. If no plants exist under the target, the spell creates some. The entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls, a -4 penalty to effective Agility and cannot move. An entangled creature that attempts to cast a spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check or lose the spell. An entangled creature can break free, ending the spell, by using a full-round action to make a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 22 Escape Artist check. Creatures can also cut the roots with slashing weapons; they have an AC of 10 and 22 hp. While entangled, the victim takes 1d4 points of constriction damage per round.
Eagle's Splendor.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate and personally forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Spellcasters who rely on Charisma do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while transmuted do increase.
Eagle's Splendor (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like eagle's splendor, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Earthquake.MOD	DESC:When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. Cave, Cavern or Tunnel: The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half), pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris. Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within. Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). River, Lake or Marsh: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, she must make a DC 15 Stamina check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.
Elemental Swarm.MOD	DESC:This spell opens a portal to a region of the Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. The caster chooses the specific region (Air, Earth, Fire or Water). When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell. The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Endure Elements.MOD	DESC:A creature protected by endure elements suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between -50° and 140° Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected. Endure elements doesn't provide any protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air and so forth.
Energy Drain.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like enervation, except that the creature struck gains 2d4 negative levels, and the negative levels last longer. There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels; but 24 hours after gaining them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = energy drain spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, the negative level also goes away, but one of the target's character levels is permanently drained. (See Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions for more of the effects of level drain.) An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
Enervation.MOD	DESC:You point your finger and utter the incantation, releasing a black ray of crackling negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If the attack succeeds, the subject gains 1d4 negative levels. If the target has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell slot from her highest available level. Negative levels stack. Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim's levels, but the negative levels from enervation don't last long enough to do so. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
Eye of Kilrogg.MOD	DESC:You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the eye of Kilrogg at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An eye of Kilrogg travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there. The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye cannot enter another plane of existence, even through a gate or similar magical portal. You must concentrate to use an eye of Kilrogg. If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate. Material Component: A bit of bat fur.
Eyebite.MOD	DESC:Each round, the caster may target a single living creature, striking it with waves of evil power. Depending on the target's Hit Dice, this attack has as many as three effects. HD Effect 10 or more Sickened 5-9 Panicked, sickened 4 or fewer Comatose, panicked, sickened The effects are cumulative and concurrent. Sickened: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the target's body. A sickened creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks and ability checks. A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a remove disease or heal spell, but a remove curse is effective. Panicked: The target becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains shaken for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of the caster during that time. This is a fear effect. Comatose: The target falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. The spell lasts for 1 round per three caster levels. The caster must spend a move action each round after the first to target a foe.
Find the Path.MOD	DESC:The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors or underground. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a magic trap. The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians). Focus: A set of divination counters of the sort you favor.
Finger of Death.MOD	DESC:The caster can slay any one living creature within range. The target is entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to survive the attack. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +25). The target might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.
Fire Shield.MOD	DESC:This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks (your choice). Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly (50%% chance of either color) - blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows. Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save. Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful save.
Fire Storm.MOD	DESC:When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural vegetation, ground cover, and any plant creatures in the area that you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6).
Flaming Sphere.MOD	DESC:A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage. A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would. The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
Flare.MOD	DESC:This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst directly in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by flare.
Fly.MOD	DESC:The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if an antimagic field negates it. Focus: A wing feather from any bird.
Fog Cloud.MOD	DESC:A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20%% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50%% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. The spell does not function underwater.
Force of Nature.MOD	DESC:This spell turns the tree touched into a treant that will fight on your behalf for a brief period of time. Force of nature must be cast on a living, healthy tree. The tree becomes a treant and follows your commands. If force of nature is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately. If you dismiss the spell, the treant tries to return to its original location before taking root.
Force of Nature (Greater).MOD	DESC:As force of nature, but this spell can create 1d4+1 individual treants.
Foresight.MOD	DESC:This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. When you are the subject of the spell, you are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose your Agility bonus to AC. When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves.
Freedom of Movement.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, cripple and entangling roots. The subject automatically succeeds on any grapple check made to resist a grapple attempt, as well as on grapple checks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin. The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The freedom of movement spell does not, however, allow water breathing. Material Component: A leather thong, bound around the arm or a similar appendage.
Frost Armor.MOD	DESC:Frost armor provides a +4 armor bonus to AC (this bonus does not stack with any other armor bonuses). Unlike mundane armor, frost armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since frost armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures cannot bypass it the way they do normal armor. Any creature striking the subject with its body or with a melee weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker becomes chilled (see Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions). If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to the chilling effect. Note that weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears, do not endanger their users in this way. Arcane Focus: A small piece of forged steel. Divine Focus: The shaman's totem.
Frost Nova.MOD	DESC:A frost nova spell is a burst of ice and cold that detonates with a high-pitched shriek. The spell deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within the area of effect; a successful Reflex save halves the damage. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure. The caster points a finger and determines the range (distance and height) at which the frost nova is to burst. The nova is 10 feet wide but only 1 foot high; the caster can control its orientation. Creatures that take damage from the frost nova must succeed at a Fortitude save or be chilled for 1d4 rounds (see Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions). Material Component: A few drops of water and a piece of glass, which must be shattered as the spell is cast.
Frostbolt.MOD	DESC:You fling forth a blast of superfrozen ice and dancing blue energy. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit with the frostbolt. The bolt deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Creatures taking damage from the frost bolt must succeed a Fortitude save or be chilled for 1d4 rounds (see Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions).
Gaseous Form.MOD	DESC:The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Agility, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials.) The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect. A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect). It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot. Arcane Material Component: A bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke.
Gate.MOD	DESC:Casting a gate spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (your choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. A gate has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. Planar Travel: As a mode of planar travel, a gate spell functions much like a plane shift spell, except that the gate opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Eternals and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a gate from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you - anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A gate cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed. Calling Creatures: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Eternals and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an experience point cost (see below). If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any Hit Dice) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their Hit Die total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its Hit Dice do not exceed twice your caster level. You cannot control a single creature with more Hit Dice than twice your caster level. Eternals and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. You can command a controlled creature to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell. If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in "livestock" rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. Note: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. XP Cost: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures function).
Geas/Quest.MOD	DESC:This spell functions similarly to lesser geas, except that it affects a creature of any Hit Dice and allows no saving throw. Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with lesser geas), the target takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the geas/quest. Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the geas/quest. A remove curse spell ends a geas/quest spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. Break enchantment does not end a geas/quest, but limited wish, miracle and wish do. Arcanists usually refer to this spell as geas, while healers call the same spell quest.
Geas (Lesser).MOD	DESC:A lesser geas places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 HD or fewer and be able to understand you. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions. If the target is prevented from obeying the lesser geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the lesser geas. A lesser geas (and all ability score penalties) can be ended by break enchantment, limited wish, remove curse, miracle or wish. Dispel magic does not affect a lesser geas.
Ghost Sound.MOD	DESC:Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans. Ghost sound can enhance the effectiveness of a silent image spell. Ghost sound can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A bit of wool or a small lump of wax.
Globe of Invulnerability (Lesser).MOD	DESC:An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells, or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area dispel magic. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty. Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled. If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it. Material Component: A glass or crystal bead that shatters at the expiration of the spell.
Guidance.MOD	DESC:This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance. The creature gets a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw or skill check. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.
Harm.MOD	DESC:Harm charges a target with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, harm deals half this amount, but it cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1. If used on an undead creature, harm acts like heal.
Heal.MOD	DESC:Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the subject: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned and poisoned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level. Heal does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels or restore permanently drained ability score points. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm.
Heal (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like heal, except as noted above. The maximum number of hit points restored to each creature is 250.
Healing Rain.MOD	DESC:Positive energy falls from the sky in the form of scintillating rain, curing 2d6 points of damage per round to living allies. Like cure spells, healing rain damages undead in its area rather than curing them.
Healing Ward.MOD	DESC:You conjure a magical totem and plant it in the ground. The totem immediately begins emanating positive energy that spreads out in all directions from the point of totem, curing 1 point of damage per round to nearby living allies, up to a character's maximum hit points. Like cure spells, healing ward damages undead in its area rather than curing them. The totem can be attacked. It has an AC of 7, hardness of 5 and 5 hp. Destroying the totem dispels it.
Heroism.MOD	DESC:This spell imbues a single creature with great bravery and morale in battle. The subject gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves and skill checks.
Heroism (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like heroism, except the creature gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 20).
Hold Animal.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects an animal instead of a humanoid.
Hold Monster.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects any living creature that fails its Will save. Arcane Material Component: One hard metal bar or rod, which can be as small as a three-penny nail.
Hold Monster (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects multiple creatures and holds any living creature that fails its Will save.
Hold Person.MOD	DESC:The target becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.) A winged creature that is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer cannot swim and may drown. Arcane Focus: A small, straight piece of iron.
Hold Person (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hold person, except as noted above.
Holy Aura.MOD	DESC:A brilliant, divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from evil, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures. Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from evil does. Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blindness/deafness, but against holy aura's save DC). Focus: A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.
Holy Sword.MOD	DESC:This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 holy weapon (+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, +2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a magic circle against evil effect (as the spell). If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one holy sword at a time. If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. Note: A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.
Holy Word.MOD	DESC:Any nongood creature within the area that hears the holy word suffers the following ill effects. HD Effect Equal to caster level Deafened Up to caster level -1 Blinded, deafened Up to caster level -5 Paralyzed, blinded, deafened Up to caster level -10 Killed, paralyzed, blinded, deafened The effects are cumulative and concurrent. No saving throw is allowed against these effects. Deafened: The creature is deafened for 1d4 rounds. Blinded: The creature is blinded for 2d4 rounds. Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the holy word. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a -4 penalty) to negate. Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by holy word.
Holy Word Shield.MOD	DESC:The utterance of the holy word of shielding immediately protects an ally from damage. The magical shield absorbs up to a number of hit points worth of damage equal to 4 times the caster's level. All damage that the subject of the spell suffers while protected by holy word shield is deducted from the shield first. If the shield is depleted to 0 hit points, then the subject of the spell begins taking damage normally.
Hooks of Binding.MOD	DESC:You summon hooked chains of burning red and yellow force. The chains snake up from the target's feet and entwine its legs and torso, holding it in place. The target is captured by the chains and cannot move. The creature also suffers a -4 penalty to Agility and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. To cast a spell, it must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell it is attempting to cast) or lose the spell slot. The chains hold the target in place, no matter if it was standing, flying or swimming. Because the chains are composed of force, this spell can affect incorporeal creatures. This spell also disallows teleportation and planar travel effects. Each round that the spell remains active, the target may attempt a Strength or Escape Artist check (DC = the spell's save DC) as a full-round action. If successful, the creature bursts or slips the bonds and ends the spell. Arcane Material Component: A brass chain link.
Hooks of Binding (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like hooks of binding, except that it can affect creatures with more than 12 HD.
Identify.MOD	DESC:The spell determines all magic properties of a single magic item, including how to activate those functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if any). Identify does not function when used on an artifact. Arcane Material Component: A pearl of at least 100 gp value, crushed and stirred into wine with an owl feather; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting.
Immolation.MOD	DESC:Blue and green flames wreathe you, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage each round to all creatures within 5 feet. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies against this damage. The flames clearly illuminate a 30-foot radius and provide shadowy illumination out to a 60-foot radius. Material Component: A bit of phosphorus.
Implant Carrion Beetle.MOD	DESC:The caster attempts to implant a carrion beetle larva within the target; the larva quickly becomes a beetle which devours the target's flesh. The caster must succeed at a touch attack to implant the carrion beetle larva. One round later, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or the carrion beetle hatches and bursts from the victim's body, causing 1d6 points of damage. In addition, the hatched carrion beetle attacks the same victim on the following round if it survived the initial damage. The carrion beetle attacks the caster's other opponents to the best of its ability once the initial target is dead. The carrion beetle is mindless, and the caster cannot direct its attacks. After appearing, the beetle remains for 1 round per caster level, then dies. Material Component: A piece of a carrion beetle shell.
Implosion.MOD	DESC:You create a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature's body. For each round you concentrate, you cause one creature to collapse in on itself, killing it. (This effect, being instantaneous, cannot be dispelled.) You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell. Implosion has no effect on creatures in gaseous form or on incorporeal creatures.
Inflict Critical Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like inflict light wounds, except that it deals 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +20).
Inflict Critical Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass inflict light wounds, except that it deals 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +40).
Inflict Light Wounds.MOD	DESC:When the caster lays her hand upon a creature, she channels negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.
Inflict Light Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:Negative energy spreads out in all directions from the point of origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +25) to nearby living enemies. Like other inflict spells, mass inflict light wounds cures undead in its area rather than damaging them. A healer capable of spontaneously casting inflict spells can also spontaneously cast mass inflict spells.
Inflict Minor Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like inflict light wounds, except that it deals 1 point of damage and a Will save negates the damage instead of halving it.
Inflict Moderate Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like inflict light wounds, except that it deals 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).
Inflict Moderate Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass inflict light wounds, except that it deals 2d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +30).
Inflict Serious Wounds.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like inflict light wounds, except that it deals 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15).
Inflict Serious Wounds (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like mass inflict light wounds, except that it deals 3d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +35).
Inner Fire.MOD	DESC:A burst of holy energy fills you; you immediately gain a +3 divine bonus on attack rolls and a +4 divine bonus to AC.
Inner Fire (Greater).MOD	CLASSES:Healer=5	DESC:As inner fire, except that you gain a +4 divine bonus on attack rolls and a +5 divine bonus to AC.
Inner Fire (Lesser).MOD	CLASSES:Healer=1	DESC:As inner fire, except that you gain a +1 divine bonus on attack rolls and a +3 divine bonus to AC.
Insanity.MOD	DESC:The affected creature suffers from a continuous confusion effect, as the spell. Remove curse does not remove insanity. Greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle or wish can restore the creature.
Invisibility.MOD	DESC:The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, its gear vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so. Items the invisible creature drops or puts down become visible; items the creature picks up disappear if it tucks them into its clothing or pouches. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible. Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell. Arcane Material Component: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.
Invisibility (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like invisibility, except that it does not end if the subject attacks.
Invisibility (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like invisibility, except that the effect is mobile with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. (If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.) Material Component: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.
Iron Body.MOD	DESC:This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain damage reduction 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire of all kinds. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems. You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your Strength score, but you take a -6 penalty to Agility as well (to a minimum Agility score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 50%% and a -8 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attacks deal damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your weight increases by a factor of ten, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack of air at the bottom of the ocean - at least until the spell duration expires.
Know Direction.MOD	DESC:You instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which "north" exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.
Legend Lore.MOD	DESC:Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4x10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are "legendary," as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds. Material Component: Incense worth at least 250 gp. Focus: Four strips of ivory (worth 50 gp each) formed into a rectangle.
Light.MOD	DESC:This spell causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and shadowy light for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function. A light spell (one with the light descriptor) counters and dispels a darkness spell (one with the darkness descriptor) of an equal or lower level. Arcane Material Component: A firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.
Lightning Guardians.MOD	DESC:The spell surrounds you with three globes of lightning - storm spirits summoned from the Elemental Plane. These spirits protect you from harm by striking out against anyone foolish enough to attack a person so protected. Anyone attacking you must make a Reflex saving throw or be struck by the spirits. Those failing their saves suffer 2d4+2 points of electricity damage. Material Component: A small sliver of iron wrapped in copper wire.
Lightning Guardians (Greater).MOD	DESC:As lightning guardians, except that those failing their saves take 3d4+3 points of electricity damage.
Lightning Guardians (Lesser).MOD	DESC:As lightning guardians, except that those failing their saves take 1d4+1 points of electricity damage.
Lightning Shield.MOD	DESC:White-yellow electricity crackles across the subject, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage +1 per 5 caster levels (maximum +5) each round to all creatures within 5 feet. Spell resistance applies to this damage. The electricity does not damage the spell's subject. The electricity clearly illuminates a 20-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius. Material Component: A copper rod.
Limited Wish.MOD	DESC:A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things. * Duplicate any arcanist spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not on another path's spell list. * Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower. * Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. * Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7 penalty on its next saving throw. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a limited wish duplicates a spell that has an experience point cost, you must pay that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component. XP Cost: 300 XP or more (see above).
Locate Creature.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like locate object, except this spell locates a known or familiar creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any. The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once. Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by nondetection and polymorph spells. Material Component: A bit of fur from a bloodhound.
Locate Object.MOD	DESC:You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. Polymorph any object fools it.
Mage Hand.MOD	DESC:You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell's range.
Magic Circle against Evil.MOD	DESC:All creatures within the area gain the effects of a protection from evil spell, and nongood summoned creatures cannot enter the area. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of an enemy's spell resistance. This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the target of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only. A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (dimension door, gate, plane shift, spiritual projection, teleport and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor or greater hooks of binding spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor or hooks effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor or greater hooks of binding spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor or hooks holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by +5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram - even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa. Arcane Material Component: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-ft.-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.
Magic Circle against Good.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic circle against evil, except that it is similar to protection from good instead of protection from evil, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.
Magic Fang.MOD	DESC:Magic fang gives one natural weapon of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite or other natural weapon. (The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage.) Magic fang can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Magic Fang (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic fang, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level). Greater magic fang can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Magic Weapon.MOD	DESC:Magic weapon gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.) You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see magic fang). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.
Magic Weapon (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can affect as many as fifty arrows, bolts or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation when used.
Major Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that sound, smell and thermal illusions are included in the spell effect. While concentrating, you can move the image within the range. The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately.
Mana Burn.MOD	DESC:A ray of magical energy leaps toward the target, leeching from it the energy necessary to cast one or more spells. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit with the ray. If the attack succeeds, the target loses spell slots totaling 1d4 spell levels, plus 1 spell level per three caster levels (maximum +6). The target loses the highest-level spell slots it has available first; two 0-level spell slots count as a single 1st-level spell slot for these purposes. The victim also takes 1d4 points of damage per spell level of the lost spell slots. For example, Maibar Naildance, a 3rd-level mage, casts this spell on Selisthes, a warlock. Maibar succeeds on his ranged touch attack, causing Selisthes to lose spell slots totaling 1d4+1 spell levels. Selisthes takes 1d4 points of damage for each spell level he loses.
Mana Shield.MOD	DESC:While mana shield is active, you can choose to avoid damage by expending spell slots. Each spell slot negates 2 points of damage per spell level. (A 1st-level spell slot negates 2 points of damage, a 2nd-level spell slot negates 4 points of damage, a 3rd-level spell slot negates 6 points of damage, and so on. A 0-level spell slot negates 1 point of damage.) Mana shield can avoid only hit point damage. You can choose to use mana shield to negate as much or as little damage from an attack as you like. Once expended, the spell slots are unavailable, as though you had used them to cast spells. Material Component: A sapphire worth at least 10 gp.
Mark of the Wild.MOD	DESC:By channeling the wild into a willing receptacle you can fill an ally with the feral grace and swiftness of the dire beasts of the Emerald Dream. The target of the spell gains a +6 enhancement bonus to natural armor for the duration of the spell. In addition, the subject of the spell gains a +2 bonus to Strength, Agility and Stamina for the spell's duration. Material Component: One sprig of silverleaf.
Mark of the Wild (Greater).MOD	DESC:As mark of the wild, except that the target gains a +10 enhancement bonus to natural armor, as well as a +6 bonus to Strength, Agility and Stamina.
Mark of the Wild (Lesser).MOD	DESC:As mark of the wild, except that the target gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor.
Medivh's Disjunction.MOD	DESC:All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature's possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor's Will save bonus, whichever is higher. You also have a 1%% chance per caster level of destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the disjunction, no items within it are disjoined. Even artifacts are subject to Medivh's disjunction, though there is only a 1%% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. Additionally, if an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. (These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even miracle or wish.) Note: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95%% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the item.
Medivh's Mnemonic Enhancer.MOD	DESC:Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or swap a prepared spell for another spell in your spellbook. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast. Prepare: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells (one 3rd-level spell, a 2nd-level spell and a 1stlevel spell, and so on). A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally. The spells prepared fade after 24 hours (if not cast). Swap: You swap out one prepared spell of 3rd-level or lower for another spell of the same level that you have in your spellbook. You no longer have the first spell prepared; you have the second spell prepared instead. Material Component: A piece of string, and ink consisting of squid secretion with black dragon's blood. Focus: An ivory plaque of at least 50 gp value.
Mending.MOD	DESC:Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps). It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by mending. The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical abilities are not restored. The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs or wands, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).
Message.MOD	DESC:You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead) or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It does not transcend language barriers. Note: To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly allowing observers the opportunity to read your lips. Focus: A short piece of copper wire.
Mind Blank.MOD	DESC:The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. Mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as eye of Kilrogg, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
Minor Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that minor image includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.
Miracle.MOD	DESC:You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your Eternal (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede. A miracle can do any of the following things. * Duplicate any healer spell of 8th level or lower (including spells to which you have access because of your domains). * Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower. * Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. * Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects. If the miracle has any of the above effects, casting it has no experience point cost. Alternatively, a healer can make a very powerful request. Casting such a miracle costs the healer 5,000 XP because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful miracles of this sort could include the following. * Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting. * Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to another through planar barriers to a specific locale with no chance of error. * Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood or other major natural disaster. In any event, a request that is out of line with the Eternal's or faith's (or alignment's) nature is refused. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle duplicates a spell that has an experience point cost, you must pay that cost. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component. XP Cost: 5,000 XP (for some uses of the miracle spell; see above).
Mirror Image.MOD	DESC:Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck. Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers cannot use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, fly when you fly and so on. Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful targeted attack against an image destroys it. An image's AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Agility modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they are burned or dead after being hit by a burning hands). While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded. An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)
Moonfire.MOD	DESC:Energy coalesces through the lens of your fury as you drop a burning mass of moonfire on an enemy. Moonfire deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10) to the target. If the target of the spell fails his saving throw, he takes an additional 2 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the caster's level (maximum 5 rounds). Material Component: A drop of water from a moonwell.
Moonfire (Greater).MOD	DESC:As moonfire, except that it deals 3d8 points of damage, +2 points per caster level (maximum +16), and the target takes an additional 6 points of damage per round (maximum 10 rounds). Material Component: A pebble soaked in water from a moonwell.
Moonglaive.MOD	DESC:You conjure a magical moonglaive and hurl it at a target. You are treated as though you have Exotic Weapon Proficiency (moonglaive) for the purpose of this spell, even if you do not meet the prerequisites. You must succeed at a ranged attack to hit the target. The moonglaive is composed of force energy, but is otherwise treated as a normal moonglaive. If the moonglaive strikes its first target, it ricochets off and strikes a second target. You make another ranged attack with a -2 penalty. If the moonglaive strikes the second target, it ricochets to a third target (or back to the first). You make a third ranged attack, this time with a -4 penalty. If the moonglaive misses a target, or after it strikes three targets, it dissipates. The moonglaive deals damage as a normal weapon of its type: 1d4/1d6, crit 19-20/x2, range inc. 20 ft., slashing.
Mount.MOD	DESC:You summon a light horse or a pony (your choice) to serve you as a mount. The steed serves willingly and well. The mount comes with a bit and bridle and a riding saddle. Material Component: A bit of horse hair.
Move Earth.MOD	DESC:Move earth moves dirt (clay, loam, sand), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes and so forth. However, in no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move. This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacierlike fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle. This spell has no effect on earth creatures. Material Component: A mixture of soils (clay, loam and sand) in a small bag, and an iron blade.
Ner'zhul's Black Tentacles.MOD	DESC:This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor or whatever surface is underfoot - including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength. Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the tentacles' grapple check. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage. Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes. The tentacles immediately attack any creature that enters the spell's area. Even creatures that are not grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed. Material Component: A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.
Neutralize Poison.MOD	DESC:You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended; but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own. The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell. Unlike with delay poison, such effects aren't postponed until after the duration - the creature need not make any saves against poison effects applied to it during the length of the spell. This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for the duration of the spell, at your option.
Nondetection.MOD	DESC:The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/ clairvoyance, locate creature and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by magic items that produce similar effects. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level. If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself. Material Component: A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.
Orb of Annihilation.MOD	DESC:The caster summons a crackling sphere of black and purple energy and hurls it at his target. He must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit with the orb. The orb deals 4d8 points of fel damage and explodes on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of the target take 1d8 points of fel damage (half on a successful Reflex save). Alternately, the caster can throw the orb of annihilation at an intersection of squares, just like any other splash weapon. Also like other splash weapons, if he misses his target he must roll randomly to see where the orb lands. (See Chapter 12: Combat, "Special Attacks," Throw Splash Weapon.)
Owl's Wisdom.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Spirit, adding the usual benefits to Will saves and Spirit-related skills. Elven rangers, healers, wilderness stalkers and paladins (and other Spiritbased spellcasters) who receive owl's wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spell slots or prepared spells for the increased Spirit, but the save DCs for their spells increase.
Owl's Wisdom (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like owl's wisdom, except that it affects multiple creatures.
Pass without Trace.MOD	DESC:The subject or subjects can move through any type of terrain and leave neither footprints nor scent. Tracking the subjects is impossible by nonmagical means.
Passwall.MOD	DESC:You create a passage through wooden, plaster or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the passwall or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one. Material Component: A pinch of sesame seeds.
Permanency.MOD	DESC:This spell makes certain other spells permanent. Depending on the spell, you must be of a minimum caster level and must expend a number of experience points. You can make the following spells permanent in regard to yourself. Minimum Spell Caster Level XP Cost Comprehend languages 9th 500 XP Darkvision 10th 1,000 XP Detect magic 9th 500 XP Read magic 9th 500 XP See invisibility 10th 1,000 XP Tongues 11th 1,500 XP You cast the desired spell and then follow it with the permanency spell. You cannot cast these spells on other creatures. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a caster of higher level than you were when you cast the spell. In addition to personal use, permanency can be used to make the following spells permanent on yourself, another creature or an object (as appropriate). Minimum Spell Caster Level XP Cost Magic fang 9th 500 XP Magic fang, greater 11th 1,500 XP Resistance 9th 500 XP Telepathic bond* 13th 2,500 XP * Only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency. Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and rendered permanent. Minimum Spell Caster Level XP Cost Alarm 9th 500 XP Ghost sound 9th 500 XP Invisibility 10th 1,000 XP Phase door 15th 3,500 XP Solid fog 12th 2,000 XP Wall of force 13th 2,500 XP Spells cast on other creatures, objects or locations (not on you) are vulnerable to dispel magic as normal. XP Cost: See tables above.
Permanent Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory and thermal elements, and the spell is permanent. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating. Material Component: A bit of fleece plus powdered jade worth 100 gp.
Persistent Image.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like silent image, except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory and thermal components, and the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish. Material Component: A bit of fleece and several grains of sand.
Phantasmal Killer.MOD	DESC:You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's target can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the target, and the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the target takes 3d6 points of damage.
Phase Door.MOD	DESC:This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster or stone walls, but not other materials. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the phase door and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A true seeing spell or similar magic reveals the presence of a phase door but does not allow its use. A phase door is subject to dispel magic. If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a passwall effect. You can allow other creatures to use the phase door by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, affiliation and hit points do not qualify. Phase door can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
Planar Binding.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar binding, except that you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12. Each creature gets a save, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.
Planar Binding (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser planar binding, except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes independent attempts to escape, and must be persuaded to aid you individually.
Planar Binding (Lesser).MOD	DESC:Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. To create the trap, you must use a magic circle spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell. The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A dimensional anchor or greater hooks of binding spell cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see magic circle against evil) to make the trap more secure. If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Plane Shift.MOD	DESC:You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From Azeroth, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%%) from your intended destination. Note: Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back. Focus: A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence the spell sends the affected creatures.
Polar Ray.MOD	DESC:A blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d6). Focus: A small, white ceramic cone or prism.
Polymorph.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like alter self, except that you change the willing subject into another form of living creature. The new form may be of the same type as the subject or any of the following types: aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant or vermin. The assumed form cannot have more Hit Dice than your caster level (or the subject's HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level. You cannot cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. The subject's creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form. Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting, and changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. The subject gains the Strength, Agility and Stamina scores of the new form but retains its own Intellect, Spirit and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form or any supernatural or spell-like abilities. Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action. Material Component: An empty cocoon.
Polymorph Any Object.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like polymorph, except that it changes one object or creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted state. The duration is determined by using the following guidelines. Changed Increase to Subject Is: Duration Factor* Same kingdom (animal, +5 vegetable, mineral) Same class (mammals, +2 fungi, metals, etc.) Same size +2 Related (twig is to tree, +2 wolf fur is to wolf, etc.) Same or lower Intellect +2 * Add all that apply. Look up the total on the next table. Duration Factor Duration Example 0 20 minutes Pebble to human 2 1 hour Marionette to human 4 3 hours Human to marionette 5 12 hours Lizard to frostsaber panther 6 2 days Sheep to wool coat 7 1 week Mouse to frostsaber panther 9+ Permanent Frostsaber panther to mouse Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intellect score of its new form. If the original form did not have a Spirit or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force. You cannot make a nonmagical object into a magic item with this spell. This spell does not affect magic items. This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithril, adamantine, arcanite or thorium. This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of baleful polymorph, polymorph and similar spells. Arcane Material Component: Mercury, gum arabic and smoke.
Prestidigitation.MOD	DESC:Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons or spell components. Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
Prismatic Spray.MOD	DESC:This spell causes seven shimmering, intertwined, multicolored beams of light to spray from your hand. Each beam has a different power. Creatures in the area of the spell with 8 HD or less are automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by one or more beams, which have additional effects. Color 1d8 of Beam Effect 1 Red 20 points fire damage (Reflex half) 2 Orange 40 points acid damage (Reflex half) 3 Yellow 80 points electricity damage (Reflex half) 4 Green Poison (Kills; Fortitude partial, take 1d6 points of Sta damage instead) 5 Blue Turned to stone (Fortitude negates) 6 Indigo Insane, as insanity spell (Will negates) 7 Violet Sent to another plane (Will negates) 8 Struck by two rays; roll twice more, ignoring any "8" results
Protection from Chaos.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks from chaotic creatures, and chaotic summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.
Protection from Energy.MOD	DESC:Protection from energy grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged. Note: Protection from energy overlaps (and does not stack with) resist energy. If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.
Protection from Evil.MOD	DESC:This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature or to exercise mental control over the creature, including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person. The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature. Arcane Material Component: A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-ft.-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.
Protection from Good.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks from good creatures, and good summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.
Protection from Law.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks from lawful creatures, and lawful summoned creatures cannot touch the subject.
Protection from Spells.MOD	DESC:The subject gains a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities (but not against supernatural and extraordinary abilities). Material Component: A diamond of at least 500 gp value, which must be crushed and sprinkled over the targets. Focus: One 1,000 gp diamond per creature to be granted the protection. Each subject must carry one such gem for the duration of the spell. If a subject loses the gem, the spell ceases to affect him.
Purify Food and Drink.MOD	DESC:This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and drink, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type or upon magic potions. Note: Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.
Rain of Fire.MOD	DESC:Small meteorites rain from the sky, exploding on impact and burning all in their wake. This spell deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage. The rain sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver or bronze. Material Components: A chunk of sulfur and a chunk of iron.
Raise Dead.MOD	DESC:You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses -1 level (or -1 HD) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses -2 points of Stamina instead (if this would reduce its Sta to 0 or less, it can't be raised). This level, Hit Die or Stamina loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died with spells prepared has a 50%% chance of losing any given prepared spell upon being raised, and half of her available spell slots, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions is affected in any way by this spell. A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders and undead creatures can't be raised (this includes Forsaken characters). The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age. Material Component: Diamonds worth a total of least 5,000 gp.
Read Magic.MOD	DESC:By means of read magic, you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects - books, scrolls, weapons and the like - that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Focus: A clear crystal or mineral prism.
Regenerate.MOD	DESC:The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise. Regenerate also cures 4d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).
Reincarnate.MOD	DESC:With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw. Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Agility and Stamina scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by -1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Stamina score is reduced by -2. (If this reduction would put its Sta at 0 or lower, it can't be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Stamina loss cannot be repaired by any means. It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character. For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created. A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age. d%% Incarnation Str Agy Sta 01-10 Dwarf, Ironforge 0 0 +2 11-20 Elf, high 0 0 -2 21-30 Elf, night 0 0 0 31-32 Gnoll +4 +2 +2 33-42 Gnome -2 0 0 43-52 Goblin -2 +2 0 53-62 Human 0 0 0 63-64 Kobold -2 +2 0 65-66 Murloc 0 +2 -2 67-76 Orc 0 0 +2 77-78 Pandaren 0 +2 +2 79-88 Tauren +2 -2 0 89 Trogg 0 0 +2 90-99 Troll, jungle 0 +2 +2 100 Other ? ? ? The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form. A wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form. Material Component: Rare oils and unguents worth a total of least 1,000 gp, spread over the remains.
Rejuvenation.MOD	DESC:The subject's wounds heal rapidly; cuts close up, bruises fade and broken bones set themselves. This spell, however, does not restore severed body parts or ruined organs. The subject regains 2d8 hit points per round; during this time he may act normally, engaging in combat or casting spells as he wishes.
Remove Curse.MOD	DESC:Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher. Remove curse counters and dispels bestow curse.
Remove Disease.MOD	DESC:Remove disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. The spell also kills parasites, including green slime and others. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher. Note: Since the spell's duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease at a later date.
Remove Fear.MOD	DESC:You instill courage in the subject, granting it a +4 morale bonus against fear effects for 10 minutes. If the subject is under the influence of a fear effect when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the spell. Remove fear counters and dispels cause fear.
Repulsion.MOD	DESC:An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting (to the limit your level allows). Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. (The creature is not forced back.) The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area.
Resilient Sphere.MOD	DESC:A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its target for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from certain magic items or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the target can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. Material Component: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic.
Resist Energy.MOD	DESC:This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic. The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the energy resistance granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects. Note: Resist energy overlaps (and does not stack with) protection from energy. If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.
Resistance.MOD	DESC:You imbue the subject with magical energy that protects it from harm, granting it a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Resistance can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Arcane Material Component: A miniature cloak.
Restoration.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser restoration, except that it also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has suffered a drained level. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. A character who has a level restored by restoration has exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to his or her previous level. Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target. Restoration does not restore levels or Stamina points lost due to death. Material Component: Diamond dust worth 100 gp that is sprinkled over the target.
Restoration (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like lesser restoration, except that it dispels all negative levels afflicting the healed creature. This effect also reverses level drains by a force or creature, restoring the creature to the highest level it had previously attained. The drained levels are restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is no more than 1 week per caster level. Greater restoration also dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity, confusion and similar mental effects. Greater restoration does not restore levels or Stamina points lost due to death. XP Cost: 500 XP.
Restoration (Lesser).MOD	DESC:Lesser restoration dispels any magical effects reducing one of the subject's ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character, and it improves an exhausted condition to fatigued. It does not restore permanent ability drain.
Resurrection.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like raise dead, except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level. Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject loses 1 level, or 2 points of Stamina if the subject was 1st level. (If this reduction would bring its Sta to 0 or lower, it can't be resurrected). This level loss or Stamina loss cannot be repaired by any means. You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders and undead creatures can't be resurrected. Forsaken characters are an exception; they may be returned to their semblance of life with this spell. Material Component: A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth a total of at least 10,000 gp.
Roar.MOD	DESC:You open your mouth and give an echoing roar, filling your allies with courage and strength. Your allies gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls. Druids can cast this spell while in animal form; the roar may be a different sound, depending on the druid's specific form.
Scrying.MOD	DESC:You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save. Knowledge Will Save Modifier None* +10 Secondhand (you have +5 heard of the subject) Firsthand (you have +0 met the subject) Familiar (you know −5 the subject well) * You must have some sort of connection to a creature you have no knowledge of. Connection Will Save Modifier Likeness or picture -2 Possession of garment -4 Body part, lock of hair, -10 bit of nail, etc. If the save fails, you create a magic sensor near the subject and can see and hear the subject and the subject's immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5%% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic and message. If the save succeeds, you cannot attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours. Arcane Material Component: The eye of a hawk, an eagle or a gryphon, plus nitric acid, copper and zinc. Arcane Focus: A mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not less than 1,000 gp. The mirror must be at least 2 feet by 4 feet. Druid and Shaman Focus: A natural pool of water. Priest Focus: A holy water font costing not less than 100 gp.
Scrying (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like scrying, except as noted above. Additionally, all of the following spells function reliably through the sensor: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, message, read magic and tongues.
Second Soul.MOD	DESC:You create a second link to bind the subject's soul to the world and restore him to life should he die. If the subject dies, he returns to life 2d4 rounds later in the same spot. The subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want to return receive no saving throws. Second soul cures all hit point damage and ability score damage. Normal poisons and normal diseases are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. The condition of the remains is not a factor. The dead creature's equipment or possessions are untouched by this spell. Second soul cannot raise a creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect. Constructs, elementals, outsiders and undead creatures also cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died naturally of old age. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses -1 level when he is raised, just as if he had lost a level to an energy-draining creature. This level loss cannot be repaired by any spell. If the subject is 1st level, he loses -1 point of Stamina instead. If the subject is a spellcaster, he loses half his remaining spell slots (as if he had expended them), in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level. Material components:A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth a total of at least 20,000 gp.
See Invisibility.MOD	DESC:You can see any objects or beings that are invisible within your range of vision, as well as any that are incorporeal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, invisible and incorporeal creatures. The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures that are simply hiding, concealed or otherwise hard to see. See invisibility can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver.
Sending.MOD	DESC:You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intellect score as low as 1 can understand the sending, though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its Intellect score. Even if the sending is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner. If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5%% chance that the sending does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.) Arcane Material Component: A short piece of fine copper wire.
Sentinel.MOD	DESC:You create a visible, magical sensor in the form of a bird. You choose bird's form, but it is always Diminutive in size. This spell must target a tree. The bird-shaped sensor appears on the tree and remains stationary where it is cast, though it can move its head. You may concentrate on the sentinel (a standard action) to see through the bird's eyes and hear through its ears from any distance. The bird sees and hears exactly what you would see and hear if you were present. You must concentrate to use a sentinel. If you do not concentrate, the bird remains motionless until you resume concentrating. Other spells and items cannot enhance the sentinel's powers (though you can use magic to improve your own eyesight). You are subject to any gaze attack the sentinel meets. A successful dispel magic cast on you or the sentinel ends the spell. The sentinel has a Stealth bonus of +7, AC 9 and 1 hp. A destroyed sentinel is dispelled. A creature that spots a sentinel must succeed at a DC 20 Survival check to notice that the bird seems artificial. Spells such as detect scrying can also detect a sentinel. Material Component: An owl's feather.
Serpent Ward.MOD	DESC:You conjure a magical totem and plans it in the ground. A ghostly, red snake head sprouts from the totem and spits fireballs at enemy creatures within 30 feet. It makes one ranged touch attack per round. You designate the totem's target as a free action each round. The totem has the Precise Shot feat, and its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Spirit modifier. Each fireball deals 1d6 points of fire damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d6). The totem can be attacked. It has an AC of 7, hardness of 5 and 5 hp. Destroying the totem dispels it.
Shadow Meld.MOD	DESC:While the spell is in effect, if you remains motionless for one full round (do not move or take any action), you become invisible. This effect functions only in darkness or areas of shadowy illumination. When you move, you become visible immediately. Of course, you are not magically silenced. If you are carrying gear, the gear also vanishes. Your allies cannot see you, unless they can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so; you, however, can see yourself. Any part of an item that you carry but that extends more than 10 feet from you becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
Shadow Strike.MOD	DESC:You charge a slashing weapon with shadow energy to deliver a particularly devastating blow. You must charge a slashing weapon you are already wielding. If your weapon deals damage on its next successful melee attack, then shadow strike deals an additional 10d8 points of damage. Shadow strike leaves a lingering effect that continues for another 6 rounds: each round the subject takes another 5d8 points of damage. If the caster's next successful melee attack does not deal damage (for example, if the target's damage reduction reduces the damage to 0), the spell discharges to no effect and is lost. If you cast another spell or stop wielding the slashing weapon before discharging the effect, the spell is lost. Focus: A slashing weapon.
Shadow Word Pain.MOD	DESC:This spell envelopes a target briefly in a cloud of dark energy conjured from the netherworld. The target is blinded for the duration of the spell. In addition, the target of the spell suffers 1d4+1 points of damage each round while affected by the spell. Material Component: The wing of a duskbat, dried and ground into a fine powder.
Shadow Word Pain (Greater).MOD	DESC:As shadow word pain, except that the target takes 3d4+1 points of damage.
Shadow Word Pain (Lesser).MOD	DESC:As shadow word pain, except that the target suffers 1d4+1 points of damage.
Shambler.MOD	DESC:The shambler spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with 11 HD each. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain is rainy, marshy or damp.
Shapechange.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like polymorph, except that it enables you to assume the form of any single, nonunique creature (of any type) from Fine to Colossal size. The assumed form cannot have more than your caster level in Hit Dice (to a maximum of 25 HD). Unlike polymorph, this spell allows incorporeal or gaseous forms to be assumed. You gain all extraordinary and supernatural abilities (both attacks and qualities) of the assumed form, but you lose your own supernatural abilities. You also gain the type of the new form in place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do not revert to their original forms. You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check. Focus: A jade circlet worth no less than 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head when casting the spell. (The focus melds into your new form when you change shape.)
Shield of Faith.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a shimmering, magical field around the touched creature that averts attacks. The spell grants the subject a +2 deflection bonus to AC, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every six levels you have (maximum +5 deflection bonus at 18th level). Material Component: A small parchment with a bit of holy text written upon it.
Shockwave.MOD	DESC:The caster stomps or slams a staff or other weapon onto the ground, releasing a powerful shockwave that deals 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The wave begins at the caster's feet and extends along the ground. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the wave continues beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier. If the ground ends (at the edge of a cliff, for instance), the wave stops at the edge. Shockwave does not damage creatures that are not in contact with the ground. Material Component: A piece of a shattered rock.
Silence.MOD	DESC:Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use spell resistance, if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks.
Silent Image.MOD	DESC:This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect. Focus: A bit of fleece.
Slow Fall.MOD	DESC:The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Slow fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth. You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it is not your turn. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. Slow fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.
Snare.MOD	DESC:This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from a supple vine, a thong or a rope. When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (Search DC 23 for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled. The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.
Solid Fog.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can't take a 5-foot step while in solid fog. However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round. Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes. Material Component: A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.
Soulstone.MOD	DESC:By concentrating on a precious gem and infusing it with soul energy, you can return yourself to life after being defeated. If a person carrying a soulstone is reduced to dead or dying status (see Chapter 12: Combat, "Injury and Death"), he may choose to use the soulstone to automatically return him to life with 5%% of his hit point total. The soulstone lasts until it is used. Material Component: A precious onyx gem worth 10,000 gp and a soul shard. XP Cost: 1,500 XP.
Speak with Animals.MOD	DESC:You can comprehend and communicate with animals. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from animals, although the spell doesn't make them any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.
Speak with Plants.MOD	DESC:You can comprehend and communicate with plants, including both normal plants and plant creatures. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from plants. A regular plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.
Spell Immunity.MOD	DESC:The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable spell resistance regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which spell resistance doesn't apply. Spell immunity protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. A creature can have only one spell immunity or greater spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.
Spell Immunity (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like spell immunity, except the immunity applies to spells of 8th level or lower. A creature can have only one spell immunity or greater spell immunity spell in effect on it at a time.
Spell Resistance.MOD	DESC:The creature gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level.
Spell Turning.MOD	DESC:Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. From 7 to 10 (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The GM rolls the exact number secretly. When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect affects you. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by spell turning effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result. d%% Effect 01-70 Spell drains away without effect. 71-80 Spell affects both of you equally at full effect. 81-97 Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 minutes. 98-100 Both of you go through a rift into another plane. Arcane Material Component: A small silver mirror.
Spiritual Projection.MOD	DESC:By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an incorporeal form onto another plane altogether. You can bring the incorporeal forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times, except to return to Azeroth (see below). If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your incorporeal self onto the Twisting Nether, leaving your physical body behind on Azeroth in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an incorporeal copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Twisting Nether. Since the Twisting Nether touches upon other planes, you can travel incorporeally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Twisting Nether, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter. Those under the effects of spiritual projection can instinctively will themselves back to their point of origin at any time. Passing through the chaos of the Nether, however, is not without its cost. Each day, creatures must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to the number of days they have been under the spell's effects or be automatically pulled back to their physical forms, which wait in suspended animation for their return. If a spiritual projection is slain, the creature will immediately return to its physical body. However, it must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10 + the number of days it spent under the spell's effects or its physical body suffers half its maximum hit points in damage. Destroying a creature's physical body while it travels spiritually will slay both the creature's physical and incorporeal forms. You and your companions may travel through the Twisting Nether indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the incorporeal form, or the destruction of your body back on Azeroth (which kills you). Material Component: A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected.
Starfall.MOD	DESC:You call down starlight that solidifies into destructive missiles of matter and energy. The missiles appear as searing stars from the air above the targets, rocketing down into them with devastating explosive power. For each round you concentrate, you target two creatures, structures or objects with one starlight missile each that deals 10d6 points of force damage; a Reflex save halves the damage. You can target different creatures each round or the same creatures repeatedly. However, you cannot target the same creature with both missiles in the same round.
Stasis Trap.MOD	DESC:The caster conjures a magical totem and plants it in the ground. The totem is visible for 1d4 rounds before it becomes invisible. Once invisible, the totem is active. If an enemy creature moves within 10 feet of the active totem within 1 round per caster level, it explodes in a shower of sparks. All enemies caught in the area are dazed for 1d4 rounds. A dazed creature can take no actions but it defends itself normally. The totem can be attacked. It has AC 7, hardness 5 and 5 hp. Destroying the totem dispels it.
Stoneskin.MOD	DESC:The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs and slashes. The subject gains damage reduction 10/adamantine. (It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged. Material Component: Granite and 250 gp worth of diamond dust sprinkled on the target's skin.
Storm Hammer.MOD	DESC:You conjure a magical force hammer and fling it at the target. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit the target. The hammer deals 2d6 points of force damage, +2d6 points of force damage for every three caster levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of 8d6 at 10th level); if the target takes damage from the attack it is dazed for 1 round. A dazed creature can take no actions, but it defends itself normally. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the daze effect. Material Component: A tiny metal hammer.
Suggestion.MOD	DESC:You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed. A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2). Material Component: A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.
Suggestion (Mass).MOD	DESC:This spell functions like suggestion, except that it can affect more creatures. The same suggestion applies to all these creatures.
Summon Monster I.MOD	DESC:This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1stlevel list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful or water creature, it is a spell of that type. Arcane Focus: A tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle.
Summon Monster II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.
Summon Monster III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list.
Summon Monster IV.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster V.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 5th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster VI.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except you can summon one creature from the 6th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster VII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 7th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Monster VIII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list. Summon Monster IX.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 9th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
Summon Nature's Ally I.MOD	DESC:This spell summons a natural creature. It appears where you designate and acts immediately on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. A summoned creature cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1stlevel list on the accompanying Summon Nature's Ally table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted. When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
Summon Nature's Ally II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 2nd-level creature or 1d3 1stlevel creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 3rd-level creature, 1d3 2nd-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 1stlevel creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally IV.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 4th-level creature, 1d3 3rdlevel creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally V.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 5th-level creature, 1d3 4th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally VI.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 6th-level creature, 1d3 5th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally VII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 7th-level creature, 1d3 6thlevel creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally VIII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 8th-level creature, 1d3 7thlevel creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Nature's Ally IX.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon nature's ally I, except that you can summon one 9th-level creature, 1d3 8thlevel creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 lower-level creatures of the same kind.
Summon Swarm.MOD	DESC:You summon a swarm of bats, rats or spiders (your choice), which attacks all other creatures within its area. (You may summon the swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. You have no control over its target or direction of travel. Arcane Material Component: A square of red cloth.
Summon Undead I.MOD	DESC:The caster defiles one corpse, turning it into an undead creature which he controls. The newly created creature acts immediately on his turn. It attacks his opponents to the best of its ability. If the caster can communicate with the creature, he can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies or to perform other actions. The corpse rises as one of the undead creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Undead table. The caster chooses which kind of creature to summon, and he can change that choice each time he casts the spell. The type and Hit Dice or Challenge Rating of the creature that provided the corpse limit the caster's options, as shown on the Summon Undead table. The summoned creature does not count against the caster's normal undead control limit. Because undead summoned with this spell are temporary, the caster cannot target them with death pact or similar effects. A summoned undead cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. The caster cannot summon creatures into an environment that cannot support them. At the end of the duration, the undead creature collapses and falls apart in a scattering of bones (or simply vanishes, if the creature was incorporeal). These remains cannot be used to summon additional undead, nor can they be used as a component for animate dead, create undead or similar spells. Casting this spell despoils the corpse used in the summoning, just as any other effect that transforms dead creatures into undead. Material Component: The corpse.
Summon Undead II.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 2nd-level list or 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 1stlevel list. One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Summon Undead III.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 3rd-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 2nd-level list or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from the 1st-level list. One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Summon Undead IV.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 4thlevel list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rdlevel list or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from any combination of lower-level lists (for example, zombies with varying Hit Dice). One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Summon Undead V.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 5thlevel list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 4thlevel list or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from any combination of lower-level lists (for example, zombies with varying Hit Dice). One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Summon Undead VI.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 6thlevel list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 5thlevel list or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from any combination of lower-level lists (for example, zombies with varying Hit Dice). One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Summon Undead VII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 7th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 6th-level list or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from any combination of lowerlevel lists (for example, zombies with varying Hit Dice). One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Summon Undead VIII.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 8thlevel list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7thlevel list or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from any combination of lower-level lists (for example, zombies with varying Hit Dice). One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Summon Undead IX.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like summon undead I, except that the caster can summon one creature from the 9thlevel list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 8thlevel list or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from any combination of lower-level lists (for example, zombies with varying Hit Dice). One corpse is required for each summoned creature.
Telekinetic Sphere.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like resilient sphere, with the addition that the creatures or objects inside the globe are nearly weightless. Anything contained within a telekinetic sphere weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents. You can move objects or creatures in the sphere that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface, or the spell's duration expires, or you begin concentrating again. If you cease concentrating (voluntarily or due to failing a Concentration check), you can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration. The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to its contents. You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it. Material Component: A hemispherical piece of clear crystal, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic and a pair of small bar magnets.
Telepathic Bond.MOD	DESC:You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of whom must have an Intellect score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another). If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. You must make this decision at the time of casting. Telepathic bond can be made permanent with a permanency spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of permanency. Material Component: Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures.
Teleport.MOD	DESC:This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight does not exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per 3 caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d%% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: "Very familiar" is a place where you have been often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you have been there often or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least 1 hour. "Seen casually" is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. "False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. On	TARGETAREA:You appear where you want to be. Off	TARGETAREA:You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10%% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar	TARGETAREA:You wind up in an area that is visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time "Mishap" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll. Familiarity On Off Similar Target Target Area Mishap Very 01-97 98-99 100 - familiar Studied 01-94 95-97 98-99 100 carefully Seen 01-88 89-94 95-98 99-100 casually Viewed once 01-76 77-88 89-96 97-100 False destination - - 81-92 93-100 (1d20+80)
Thorn Shield.MOD	DESC:Thorns pop out of the subject's skin, armor and clothing. The thorns themselves are not dangerous, but they indicate that anyone attacking the protected creature is subject to magic retribution. Any creature striking the subject in melee deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of piercing damage +1 point per caster level. If a creature has spell resistance, it applies to this damage.
Thunderclap.MOD	DESC:You slam the ground, causing an enormous thunderlike clap that ruptures enemies' ear drums. All creatures within the area (except you) take 1d8 points of sonic damage per three caster levels (maximum 5d8). Creatures who take damage from this effect are also inundated with jittering sonic energy and are slowed (as if they were chilled) for 1 full round. Material Component: A small silver hammer.
Time Stop.MOD	DESC:This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas and the like can still harm you. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the time stop has its normal effects on other creatures once the time stop ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies or flee from combat. You cannot move or harm items held, carried or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession. You are undetectable while time stop lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an antimagic field while under the effect of time stop.
Tongues.MOD	DESC:This spell grants the subject the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. Tongues does not enable the subject to speak with creatures that do not speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way. Tongues can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Arcane Material Component: A small clay model of a ziggurat, which shatters when the verbal component is pronounced.
Touch of Fatigue.MOD	DESC:You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a melee touch attack to strike a target. The subject is immediately fatigued (see Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions) for the spell's duration. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued. Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires. Material Component: A drop of sweat.
Touch of Idiocy.MOD	DESC:With a touch, you reduce the target's mental faculties. Your successful melee touch attack applies a -1d6 penalty to each of the target's Intellect, Spirit and Charisma scores. This penalty cannot reduce any of these scores below 1. This spell's effect may make it impossible for the target to cast some or all of its spells, if the requisite ability score drops below the minimum required to cast spells of that level.
Touch of Life.MOD	DESC:You can raise and temporarily restore life to a creature who has been dead up to 1 round per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want to return receive no saving throw. Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor and health, with no loss of level (or Stamina) or spell slots. Normal poisons and normal diseases are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is returned to life. The dead creature's equipment or possessions are untouched by this spell. You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then killed again (essentially, an inanimate body). Constructs, elementals, outsiders and undead creatures cannot be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age. When the spell expires, the subject immediately drops dead as though it had never been raised. Though the subject briefly returns to life, use the time of its death prior to the casting of this spell for the purposes of determining its time since death. For example, Mardrake, a 17th-level shaman, casts touch of life on his fallen ally Devania Moonwhisper on the round after she died. Five rounds later, Devania is slain again. Mardrake can cast touch of life on Devania again any time within the next 12 rounds. If she survives to the end of the spell's normal duration (17 rounds in this case), then Mardrake cannot cast touch of life on her again because she is now beyond the time limit. Casting this spell does not affect the ability of a caster to restore permanent life to the subject (by means of raise dead or resurrection, for example). Material Component: Diamonds worth a total of at least 5,000 gp.
Transport via Plants.MOD	DESC:You can enter any normal plant (Medium or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the transport via plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures. The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from the tree.
True Resurrection.MOD	DESC:This spell functions like raise dead, except that you can resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is the most common method). Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Stamina points) or prepared spells. You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead creatures. Forsaken characters are an exception; they may be returned to their semblance of life with this spell. Even true resurrection can't restore to life a creature who has died of old age. Material Component: A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth a total of at least 25,000 gp.
True Seeing.MOD	DESC:You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under magical distortion effects, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions and sees the true forms of polymorphed, changed or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120 feet. True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. True seeing does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures that are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance, for example. Material Component: An ointment for the eyes that costs 250 gp and is made from mushroom powder, saffron and fat.
Trueshot Aura.MOD	DESC:You are surrounded by a glowing, blue-white aura that grants keen insight to archers, crossbow-wielders and similar fighters. Allies within the radius, including you, gain a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls and a +4 insight bonus on damage rolls with ranged weapons. These bonuses only apply if the target of the attack is within 30 feet of the character. An ally gains these benefits only when in the spell's radius. An ally within the radius when the spell is cast retains the benefits only while he remains within the spell's radius. An ally who enters the radius after the spell is cast gains the benefits for as long as he remains within the radius.
Trueshot Aura (Greater).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as trueshot aura, but grants recipients a +3 insight bonus on attack rolls and a +6 insight bonus on damage rolls with ranged weapons.
Trueshot Aura (Lesser).MOD	DESC:This spell functions as trueshot aura, but grants recipients a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and a +2 insight bonus on damage rolls with ranged weapons.
Unholy Aura.MOD	DESC:A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects. First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of protection from good, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures. Second, a warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures. Third, the abjuration blocks possession and mental influence, just as protection from good does. Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of temporary Strength damage (Fortitude negates). Focus: A tiny reliquary containing some sacred relic, such as a piece of parchment from an unholy text. The reliquary costs at least 500 gp.
Unholy Frenzy.MOD	DESC:The caster grants the subject the untiring endurance and energy of the undead. The transmuted creature moves and acts more quickly than normal. When making a full attack action, the creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by bloodlust or a weapon of speed; nor does it actually grant an extra action, so it cannot be used to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) This spell places great stress on the subject's body. He takes 1d4 points of damage each round. A successful save voids the entire spell, both the extra attack and the damage. A creature cannot choose to save only against the damage. Cripple counters and dispels unholy frenzy.
Vampiric Aura.MOD	DESC:The caster and allies within the spell's radius can drain life with successful melee attacks. For each point of damage such an ally deals to a living creature with a melee attack, she gains 1 temporary hit point. An affected ally cannot gain more hit points from a single creature than that creature has (i.e., his current hit points + 10). These temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. An ally gains these benefits only when in the spell's radius. An ally within the radius when the spell is cast retains the benefits only while she remains within the spell's radius. An ally who enters the radius after the spell is cast gains the benefits for as long as she remains within the radius. Material Component: Powdered dreadlord horn.
Wall of Force.MOD	DESC:A wall of force spell creates an invisible wall of force. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. However, Medivh's disjunction immediately destroys it. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks intangible creatures as well as material ones (though intangible creatures can usually get around the wall by floating under or over it through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force. The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10- foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails. Wall of force can be made permanent with a permanency spell. Material Component: A pinch of powder made from a clear gem.
Wall of Thorns.MOD	DESC:A wall of thorns spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to (25 - the creature's AC). Agility and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (A creature with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Agility and dodge bonuses, takes no damage from contact with the wall.) You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10- by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier. A creature can force its way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, the creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free; or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage. A wall of thorns can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes. Despite its appearance, a wall of thorns is not actually a living plant and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.
War Drums.MOD	DESC:The invigorating sound of war drums echoes in the ears of your allies, spurring them to make short work of their opponents. You and all allies within range gain a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls. An ally gains these benefits only when in the radius of the spell. An ally within the radius when the spell is cast retains the benefits only while she remains within the spell's radius. An ally who enters the radius after the spell is cast gains the benefits for as long as she remains within the radius.
Water Breathing.MOD	DESC:The transmuted creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air. Arcane Material Component: A short reed or piece of straw.
Whirlwind.MOD	DESC:This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.) Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.
Wind Walk.MOD	DESC:You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the gaseous form spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently. Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80%% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors or the like. A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others. For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.
Wish.MOD	DESC:Wish is one of the mightiest spells an arcanist can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even wish, however, has its limits. A wish can produce any one of the following effects. * Duplicate any arcanist spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell is not on another path's spell list. * Duplicate any arcanist spell of 7th level or lower even if it is on another path's spell list. * Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower. * Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as geas/quest or insanity. * Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value. * Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an existing magic item. * Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies. * Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the experience point loss from casting a spell or the level or Stamina loss from being raised from the dead. * Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from losing an experience level. * Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. * Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies. You may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.) Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells). Material Component: When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component. XP Cost: The minimum experience point cost for casting wish is 5,000 XP. When a wish duplicates a spell that has an experience point cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a wish creates or improves a magic item, you must pay twice the normal experience point cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.
Withering Blight.MOD	DESC:Normal vegetation in the area becomes sickened and diseased. Affected plants cease production of seeds and fruit, if applicable. Living creatures in contact with blighted ground at any point during a turn must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or contract blight plague. Spell resistance applies to this effect. All turning checks to turn undead on blighted ground take a -2 profane penalty and turning checks to rebuke undead gain a +2 profane bonus; spell resistance does not apply to these effects. Blight plague is a supernatural disease (incubation period 1 minute; damage 1d4 temporary Intellect). Humanoids reduced to 0 Intellect immediately turn into zombies. Unlike normal diseases, blight plague continues until the victim reaches Intellect 0 or receives a remove disease spell or similar magic.
Zone of Truth.MOD	DESC:Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
