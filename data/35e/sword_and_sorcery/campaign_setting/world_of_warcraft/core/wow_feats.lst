PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 13, Power Attack, base attack bonus +4.	BENEFIT:You may attempt a Bash as a full attack action with a bludgeoning weapon.

The foe takes no damage from the blow, but if he fails the save, he is stunned for 1 round (see Chapter 13: Abilities and Conditions). You can use Bash only once per round and no more than once per level per day. When you use Bash, you forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the bloodlust spell). Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be stunned. Special: Warriors can select Bash as one of their warrior bonus feats.	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack	PRESTAT:1,STR=13	PRETOTALAB:4

PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Bluff 3 ranks.	BENEFIT:You may use the aid another action at a distance of up to 30 feet.

Blind-Fight	SOURCEPAGE:p.142	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can fight in melee without seeing your foes.	BENEFIT:In melee, every time you miss because of concealment, you can reroll your miss chance one time to see if you actually hit. An invisible attacker gets no advantage to hit you in melee. Thus, you don't lose your Agility bonus to AC, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible attacker's bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however. You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduce your speed to three-quarters normal, instead of one-half. Normal: Regular attack roll modifiers for invisible attackers apply, and you lose your Agility bonus to AC. The speed reduction for darkness and poor visibility also applies. Special: Warriors may select Blind-Fight as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Block Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.143	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You may channel magic energy to block the effects of a spell.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Iron Will, Magic Energy Control, caster level 5th.	BENEFIT:When you are the target of a spell, you may disrupt the casting and counter its effects.

If you succeed, you identify the spell and may automatically attempt to counter it according to the normal counterspell rules.
Bloodletter	SOURCEPAGE:p.143	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You know how to make your enemies bleed.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +3.	BENEFIT:When you score a critical hit against an opponent in melee, you also cause a bleeding wound. The opponent takes 2 points of damage next round and each round thereafter from blood loss. Any magical healing or a DC 15 Heal check stops the bleeding. Creatures immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect. Special:Warriors can select Bloodletter as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Brew Potion	SOURCEPAGE:p.143	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Item Creation	DESC:You can create potions.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 3rd.	BENEFIT:You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes 1 day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own caster level. The base price of a potion is its spell level x its caster level x 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in experience points and use up raw materials costing 1/2 of this base price. When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the spell's target. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an experience point cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must also expend the material component or pay the experience points when creating the potion.
Brilliant Leadership	SOURCEPAGE:p.143	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You inspire and challenge other spellcasters who follow you, encouraging them to explore their talents to the fullest.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Leadership, able to cast 3rd-level spells.	BENEFIT:Each day, all of your followers who are spellcasters gain extra spell slots. Each follower gets one extra spell slot; this spell slot can be of any level that is at most two levels lower than the highest spell level you can cast. For example, if you can cast 5th-level spells, each of your followers gains one extra spell slot that she can use for a 0-level, 1st-level, 2nd-level or 3rd-level spell.
Careful Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You know how to take the time to line up your attacks for the best effect.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Spt 13	BENEFIT:You can spend a move action studying your target, which can be no more than 30 feet away. If you do, you gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against that opponent until the beginning of your next round. Special: Warriors can select Careful Strike as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Challenging Shout	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shout	DESC:You dare your enemies to show you their mettle.	BENEFIT:All opponents adjacent to you must attempt Will saves (DC 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier).

Special:Warriors can select Challenging Shout as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Cleave	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can cut through one foe to attack another foe.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 13, Power Attack.

You cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round. Special: Warriors can select Cleave as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Close Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can use a ranged weapon while avoiding opponents in melee combat.

Collective Fury	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shout	DESC:The only sight scarier than one angry orc is a gang of angry orcs.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Cha 13, ability to rage, Intimidating Shout, Leadership.	BENEFIT:When you enter a rage, all other characters within 30 feet gain the Intimidating Shout feat until you exit your rage, but they can only use the feat if they are raging. This benefit only applies while your allies remain within the 30-foot radius; allies who enter that area after you shout do not gain the effect.
Combat Casting	SOURCEPAGE:p.144	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at casting spells in combat.	BENEFIT:You receive a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast spells or use spell-like abilities while on the defensive or while you are grappling or pinned.

BENEFIT:When you use the attack or full attack action in melee, you can take a penalty of as much as -5 on your attack roll and the same number (+5 or less) as a dodge bonus to your AC. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The changes to attack rolls and AC last until your next action.

BENEFIT:Once per round, if the opponent you have designated as your Dodge target (see the Dodge feat) makes a melee attack or melee touch attack against you and misses, you may make an attack of opportunity against that opponent. You take a -4 penalty on your attack roll. Resolve and apply the effects from both attacks simultaneously. Even if you have Combat Reflexes, you cannot use the Counterattack feat more than once per round. This feat does not grant more attacks of opportunity than you are normally allowed in a round. Special: Warriors can select Counterattack as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Craft Magic Arms and Armor	SOURCEPAGE:p.145	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Item Creation	DESC:You can make magic weapons, armor and shields.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 5th.	BENEFIT:You can create any magic weapon, armor or shield for which you meet the prerequisites. Enchanting a weapon, a suit of armor or a shield takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in the price of its magical features. To enchant a weapon, a suit of armor or a shield, you must spend 1/25 of its features' total price in experience points and use up raw materials costing 1/2 this total price. The weapon, armor or shield to be enchanted must be a masterwork item that you provide. Its cost is not included in the above cost. You can also mend a broken magic weapon, suit of armor or shield if it is one that you could make. Doing so costs half the experience points, half the raw materials and half the time needed to craft the item in the first place. (See Chapter 9: Weapons and Armor for more information on magic weapons and armor.)

Some rods incur extra costs in material components or experience points. These costs are in addition to those derived from the rod's base price.
Craft Staff	SOURCEPAGE:p.145	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Item Creation	DESC:You can make magic staffs.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 12th.	BENEFIT:You can create any staff for which you meet the prerequisites. Crafting a staff takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a staff, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in experience points and use up raw materials costing 1/2 its base price. A newly created staff has 50 charges.

BENEFIT:You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know. Crafting a wand takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. A wand's base price is its caster level x the spell level x 750 gp. To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in experience points and use up raw materials costing 1/2 of this base price. A newly created wand has 50 charges. Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an experience point cost also carries a commensurate cost.

Craft Wondrous Item	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Item Creation	DESC:You can make wondrous magic items.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 3rd.

Crafty Leader	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Technology	DESC:You work well with others and can use teamwork to speed device construction.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Craft (any) 6 ranks.	BENEFIT:When you are assisted in a Craft check by at least three other people who each have at least 1 rank in the same Craft skill, each assistant who succeeds at her check to assist you grants you a +4 bonus instead of the normal +2. Special: Tinkers can select Crafty Leader as one of their bonus tinker feats
Deflect Arrows	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can deflect incoming projectile and thrown weapons.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agy 13, Improved Unarmed Strike.	BENEFIT:You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons and ranged attacks generated by spell effects can't be deflected. Special: Warriors can select Deflect Arrows as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Deflect Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.146	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You may counter a spell and choose a new target for it.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Block Spell, Iron Will, Magic Energy Control, Mirror Spell, Reflect Spell, caster level 9th.	BENEFIT:When you successfully counter a spell, instead of dismissing it entirely, you may choose a new target for the spell. To do so you must spend a spell slot that is at least the same level as the spell you are deflecting. If you deflect the spell, choose a new target for it. The new target must be legal and within range. The spell then takes effect normally at the new target, just as if the caster had originally chosen that target. If a spell allows multiple targets, you choose all targets. For example, Leanine Starborn, a high elf priestess with the Deflect Spell feat, is engaged in combat with Alastair Bentstaff, a human mage. Leanine readies an action to counter a spell. Alastair attempts to cast frost nova; Leanine identifies it with a Spellcraft check and successfully counters it with dispel magic. She then decides to deflect the spell onto Alastair's cronies. She spends a 3rd-level spell slot (because frost nova is a 3rd-level spell). Alastair's frost nova explodes among his friends at the location Leanine has chosen, with the damage, save DC and other pertinent information based on Alastair's statistics, as normal. Leanine expended two 3rd-level spell slots - one for dispel magic and one for the deflection - to deflect Alastair's frost nova.

BENEFIT:When a device malfunctions, you may attempt a Craft (technological device) check (DC = 15 + the device's MR). If you succeed, the device operates normally for 1d3 rounds, giving you a chance to finish the job you are doing, make an emergency repair, or get clear before it blows up. If you roll a natural 20 on the check, the malfunction is completely averted. You may use this feat only once on a particular malfunction. Special: Tinkers can select Delay Malfunction as one of their tinker bonus feats.
Demoralizing Shout	SOURCEPAGE:p.147	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shout	DESC:Your shout shakes your enemies' confidence.	BENEFIT:When you make a Demoralizing Shout, each opponent within 30 feet takes a ??2 morale penalty on damage rolls. Demoralizing Shout is a fear effect.

Dodge	SOURCEPAGE:p.147	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at avoiding attacks.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Agy 13.	BENEFIT:During your action, you designate an opponent and receive a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks from that opponent. You can select a new opponent on any action. A condition that makes you lose your Agility bonus to AC also makes you lose dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack, unlike most other bonus types. Special: Warriors can select Dodge as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Drums of Courage	SOURCEPAGE:p.147	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You know the secrets of orcish war rhythms, and can drive your allies into a terrifying frenzy by playing the battle drums.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Perform (percussion instruments) 5 ranks.	BENEFIT:With a good set of drums, you can inspire courage in your allies. Make a DC 20 Perform (percussion instruments) check. If successful, all allies within 30 feet who can hear your drums gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls and on saving throws against charm and fear effects. This morale bonus lasts for as long as your allies hear your drums and for 5 rounds thereafter. Playing the war drums is a standard action and requires concentration, which means you must take a standard action each round to keep playing.
Emergency Repair	SOURCEPAGE:p.147	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Technology	DESC:You are adept at spotting mechanical problems and making quick repairs.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Spt 13, Delay Malfunction.	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you may make a Craft (technological device) check to repair a malfunctioning or broken technological device. This check's DC is 20 + (2 x the device's MR). If you succeed, the device does not destroy itself or endanger its user due to the malfunction. Instead, it operates normally for 1 hour and then ceases functioning until it can undergo normal repairs. If you roll a natural 20 on the check, you completely and permanently repair the item. Special: Tinkers can select Emergency Repair as one of their bonus tinker feats.
Empower Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.147	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You can cast spells with greater power.	BENEFIT:All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by half.

Enduring Leadership	SOURCEPAGE:p.147	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your tireless efforts are an example to your followers, and you need but a word to push them to the peak of their physical abilities.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Endurance, Leadership.	BENEFIT:Once per day as a free action, you may inspire your followers to exceptional efforts. Each follower receives a +4 morale bonus on his initiative check, and his fastest form of movement increases by +10 feet. This movement increase is considered an enhancement bonus. If any of your followers enter a rage, they are not fatigued at the end of the rage. These benefits last for 1 round + 1 round per your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).
Enlarge Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.147	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You can cast spells with greater range than normal.	BENEFIT:You can alter a spell with a range of close, medium or long to increase its range by 100%%.

An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level. Spells with ranges not defined by distance, as well as spells with ranges that are not close, medium or long, cannot be increased by this feat.
Eschew Materials	SOURCEPAGE:p.148	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can cast spells without needing material components.	BENEFIT:You can cast any spell that has a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. (Casting the spell provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.)

To craft a ring, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in experience points and use up raw materials costing 1/2 its base price. You can also mend a broken ring if it is one you could make. Doing so costs half the experience points, half the raw materials and half the time needed to forge that ring. Some magic rings incur extra costs in material components or experience points.

BENEFIT:You receive a +2 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature's spell resistance. This bonus stacks with the one from Spell Penetration.

Warriors can select Greater Weapon Specialization as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Heighten Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.149	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You can cast spells as if they were higher level.	BENEFIT:A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.
Improved Bull Rush	SOURCEPAGE:p.150	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at pushing opponents back.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 13, Power Attack.	BENEFIT:When you perform a bull rush, you do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender. You also receive a +4 bonus on the opposed Strength check you make to push back the defender.

Improved Counterspell	SOURCEPAGE:p.150	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at countering your opponents' spells.	BENEFIT:When counterspelling, you may use a spell of the same school that is 1 or more spell levels higher than the target spell. Normal: Without this feat, you may counter a spell only with the same spell or with a spell specifically designated as a counter to the target spell.
Improved Critical	SOURCEPAGE:p.150	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose one type of weapon. You make critical hits with that weapon more often.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +8.	BENEFIT:When using the selected weapon, your threat range is doubled. Special: You can take Improved Critical multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time, it applies to a new type of weapon. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that increases a weapon's threat range.

Special: Warriors can select Improved Disarm as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Improved Feint	SOURCEPAGE:p.150	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You excel at misdirecting your opponents' attention in combat.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Int 13, Combat Expertise.

Improved Overrun	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You excel at knocking opponents down.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 13, Power Attack.	BENEFIT:When you attempt to overrun opponents, they cannot choose to avoid you. You also receive a +4 bonus on your Strength check to knock down opponents. Normal: Without this feat, targets of an overrun can choose to avoid or to block you (see Chapter 12: Combat, "Special Attacks," Overrun). Special: Warriors may select Improved Overrun as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Improved Precise Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your ranged attacks can ignore cover or concealment.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agy 19, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +11.	BENEFIT:Your ranged attacks ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover and the miss chance granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks. Additionally, when you shoot or throw ranged weapons at grappling opponents, you automatically strike the opponent you have chosen. Normal: See the normal rules for cover and concealment (Chapter 12: Combat, "Combat Modifiers"). Without this feat, shooting or throwing a ranged weapon at targets involved in a grapple requires you to roll randomly to see which combatant you hit. Special: Warriors can select Improved Precise Shot as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Improved Shield Bash	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at bashing with your shield and retaining its shield bonus to your AC.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Shield Proficiency.

BENEFIT:When you strike at an object held or carried by an opponent (such as a weapon or shield), you do not provoke an attack of opportunity. You also receive a +4 bonus on any attack roll made to attack an object held or carried by another character. Normal: Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you strike at an object held or carried by another character. Special: Warriors can select Improved Sunder as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Improved Trip	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You excel at making trip attacks.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Int 13, Combat Expertise.	BENEFIT:You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent while you are unarmed. You also receive a +4 bonus on your Strength check to trip your opponent. If you trip an opponent in melee combat, you immediately get a melee attack against that opponent as if you had not used your attack for the trip attempt. Normal: Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent while you are unarmed. Special: Warriors can select Improved Trip as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Improved Two-Weapon Fighting	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You excel at fighting with two weapons.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agy 17, Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +6.	BENEFIT:In addition to the standard single attack you get with an off-hand weapon, you get a second attack with that weapon, but at a -5 penalty. Normally: Without this feat, you get only a single extra attack with an off-hand weapon. Special: Warriors can select Improved Two-Weapon Fighting as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Improved Unarmed Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.151	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at fighting unarmed.	BENEFIT:You are considered to be armed even when unarmed; thus, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from armed opponents when you attack them while unarmed. You do, though, get attacks of opportunity against opponents who make unarmed attacks on you. Normal: Without this feat, you are considered unarmed when attacking with an unarmed strike, and you can deal only nonlethal damage with such an attack. Special: Warriors can select Improved Unarmed Strike as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Inner Rage	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shout	DESC:When you enter a rage, you can shout powerfully.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ability to rage, one shout feat.	BENEFIT:When you enter a rage, you can use a shout feat without using up one of your shouts per day. However, the shout's effects last only half as long as normal.
Intimidating Shout	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Shout	DESC:You can terrify opponents with a fearsome battle cry.	BENEFIT:When you make an Intimidating Shout, opponents within 30 feet must attempt Will saves (DC 10 + half your character level + your Charisma bonus). A foe who fails this saving throw is shaken. Intimidating Shout is a fear effect. Special: If you have 5 or more ranks in Intimidate, increase the Will save's DC by +2. You may spend a hero point when you make an Intimidating Shout. If you do, opponents who fail their saves are panicked for 1d6 rounds. Warriors can select Intimidating Shout as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Iron Will	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your incredible will saves you from danger.	BENEFIT:You receive a +2 bonus on all Will saves.
Leadership	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Others desire to follow you, and you may attempt to recruit cohorts and followers.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Character level 6th.	BENEFIT:This feat enables you to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist you. Cohorts are more powerful than followers, and you may only ever have one cohort. See the following tables to determine what sort of cohort and how many followers you can recruit. Leadership Modifiers: Several factors can affect your Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract and determined by the GM) raises or lowers your Leadership score: Leader's Reputation Modifier Great renown +2 Fairness and generosity +1 Special power +1 Failure -1 Aloofness -1 Cruelty -2 Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort: The Leader... Modifier Has a familiar, special mount, -2 or animal companion Recruits cohorts of a different alignment -1 Caused the death of a cohort -2* * Cumulative per cohort killed. Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a new follower, use any of the following modifiers that apply. The Leader... Modifier Has a stronghold, base of operations, +2 guildhouse, or the like Moves around a lot -1
Lightning Reflexes	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your incredible reflexes allow you to avoid danger.	BENEFIT:You receive a +2 bonus on all Reflex saves.
Lightning Reload	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You reload firearms with well-practiced efficiency.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agy 13, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms).	BENEFIT:You can reload firearms much faster than normal. You can reload a firearm that normally takes a move action to reload as a free action, a firearm that takes a standard action to reload as a move action, and a firearm that takes more than 1 round to reload in half the normal time. Special: Warriors can select Lightning Reload as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Magic Energy Control	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You understand the flow of magical energy and find it easy to tap into and control.	BENEFIT:You prepare spells in half the normal time. You gain a +1 bonus on Will saves. Special: A high elf character with this feat no longer suffers from the effects of magic addiction. As a result, he prepares his spells in the normal amount of time. A high elf is not actually cured of the addiction, so night elves, for instance, can still detect the taint normally.
Manyshot	SOURCEPAGE:p.152	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can fire multiple arrows simultaneously at a target.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agy 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6.	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a -4 penalty) to determine success, and deal damage normally (see "Special," below). For every 5 points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you can add one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. Each arrow after the second, however, adds a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total penalty of -6 with three arrows and -8 with four). Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired. Special: Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage. Warriors can select Manyshot as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Martial Weapon Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose a type of martial weapon. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.	BENEFIT:You make attack rolls with the selected weapon normally. Normal: When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls. Special: Barbarians, paladins and warriors are proficient with all martial weapons. They need not select this feat. You can take Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new type of weapon.
Maximize Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You can cast spells to their full effect.	BENEFIT:All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.
Mighty Lungs	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can shout many times per day.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: One shout feat.	BENEFIT:You can shout two additional times per day. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times; its effects stack. Warriors can select Mighty Lungs as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Mirror Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You may channel additional arcane energy to duplicate the effects of a spell you just cast.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Iron Will, Magic Energy Control, caster level 3rd.	BENEFIT:A mirrored spell creates two copies of the same spell. The two copies of the spell resolve simultaneously and separately. They may have the same or different targets. A mirrored spell takes up a spell slot equal to twice the original spell's level +1.
Mobility	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are difficult to hit while moving.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agy 13, Dodge.	BENEFIT:You receive a +4 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. Conditions that make you lose your Agility bonus to AC also make you lose dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses stack with each other. Special: Warriors can select Mobility as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Mounted Archery	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at making ranged attacks while mounted.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.	BENEFIT:The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: -2 instead of -4 if your mount is taking a double move; -4 instead of -8 if your mount is running. Special: Warriors can select Mounted Archery as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Mounted Combat	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are skilled at fighting while mounted.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ride 1 rank.	BENEFIT:Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll. (Essentially, the Ride check result becomes the mount's AC if it is higher than the mount's regular AC.) Special: Warriors can select Mounted Combat as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Natural Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.153	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can cast spells while in a wild shape.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Spt 13, wild shape ability.	BENEFIT:You can complete verbal and somatic components of spells while in a wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell. You can also use any material components or focuses you possess, even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while in a wild shape.
Pistol Whip	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can use a firearm as an improvised melee weapon without damaging it.	BENEFIT:You are proficient at using a firearm as a melee weapon and can do so without damaging it. A firearm used in this way deals bludgeoning damage depending on its size, as shown on the table below. Firearm Size Damage (S) Damage (M) Light 1d3 1d4 One-handed 1d4 1d6 Two-handed 1d6 1d8 Normal: Any character may use a firearm as a melee weapon, though she takes normal nonproficiency penalties and the firearm takes the same damage it deals. Special: Warriors can select Pistol Whip as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Point Blank Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You excel at making ranged attacks at close range.	BENEFIT:You receive a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet. Special: Warriors can select Point Blank Shot as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Power Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can make severely damaging attacks.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Str 13.	BENEFIT:On your action, before making attack rolls for the round, you can choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add it to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage apply until your next turn. Special: If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, add twice the number subtracted from your attack rolls instead. The bonus from Power Attack cannot be added to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty on all attack rolls still applies. (Normally, a double weapon is treated as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.) Warriors can select Power Attack as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Precise Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can fire into melee with exceptional accuracy.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.	BENEFIT:You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard -4 penalty on your attack roll. Special: Warriors can select Precise Shot as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Precision Leadership	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:By training your followers to coordinate their fire, you have turned individual soldiers into a single, deadly ranged weapon.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Leadership, Point Blank Shot.	BENEFIT:If a number of your followers make ranged attacks against the same target at the same time (by delaying or readying actions, for instance), each follower receives a +1 bonus on his damage roll for each other follower attacking at the same time. If all followers attacking at the same time are using the same type of weapon (composite longbows or flintlock pistols, for example), add together the damage from all of the successful attacks before applying damage reduction.
Pulverize	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Your blows with your tauren totem are occasionally so mighty that they create a small shockwave spreading out from the impact.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 15, Spt 13, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (tauren totem), Follower of the Totem, base attack bonus +6.	BENEFIT:When you score a critical hit with a tauren totem, all creatures adjacent to the creature you strike take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + half your Strength bonus. Special: Warriors can select Pulverize as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Punishing Blow	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You are trained to take advantage of unsuspecting foes using your chosen weapon.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +4.	BENEFIT:Select a type of melee weapon with which you are proficient. You deal +1d6 points of damage with that weapon as long as the target is denied her Agility bonus to AC or if you flank the target. If you score a critical hit, this extra damage is not multiplied. Special: The extra damage stacks with that caused by a rogue's backstab. You can gain this feat multiple times; each time it applies to a different weapon. Warriors can select Punishing Blow as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Quick Draw	SOURCEPAGE:p.154	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can draw your weapon or other object with incredible speed.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.	BENEFIT:You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see Chapter 5: Skills, "Sleight of Hand") as a move action. Characters with this feat may throw weapons at their full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow). Normal: Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement; as well, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action. Special: Warriors can select Quick Draw as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Quicken Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.155	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:You can cast spells almost instantly.	BENEFIT:Casting a quickened spell is a free action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened spell per round. A spell with a casting time of more than 1 full-round action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Special: This feat can't be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including healer spells cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.
Rapid Reload	SOURCEPAGE:p.155	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light or heavy).	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).	BENEFIT:The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity. If you have selected this feat for a hand or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could if using a bow. Normal: Characters without this feat need a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow. Special: You can take Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new type of crossbow. Warriors can select Rapid Reload as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Rapid Shot	SOURCEPAGE:p.155	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can make ranged attacks with incredible speed.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Agy 13, Point Blank Shot.	BENEFIT:You can get one extra attack per round with a ranged weapon. The attack is at your highest base attack bonus, but each attack you make in that round (the extra one and the normal ones) takes a -2 penalty. You must use the full attack action to use this feat. Special: Warriors can select Rapid Shot as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Reckless Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You throw caution by the wayside as you smash your opponents as hard as possible.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Str 13.	BENEFIT:On your action, before making attack rolls for the round, you may choose to subtract a number from your AC and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty to AC and bonus on damage apply until your next turn. Special: If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon wielded in two hands, add twice the number subtracted from your AC instead. You cannot add the bonus from Reckless Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with unarmed strikes or natural weapon attacks), even though the penalty to AC still applies. (Normally, you treat a double weapon as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.) Warriors can select Reckless Attack as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Reflect Spell	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	DESC:Instead of dissipating the energy of a countered spell, you may reflect that spell back upon its caster.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Block Spell, Iron Will, Magic Energy Control, Mirror Spell, caster level 7th.	BENEFIT:When you successfully counter a spell, instead of dismissing it entirely you may choose to retarget it upon its caster. To do so you must spend a spell slot that is at least the same level as the spell you are reflecting. If you decide to reflect the spell, the spell targets its caster if the caster is a legal target. (If the caster is not a legal target, the reflect attempt fails.) The spell then takes effect normally. For example, Leanine Starborn, a high elf priestess with the Reflect Spell feat, is engaged in combat with Alastair Bentstaff, a human mage. Leanine readies an action to counter a spell. Alastair attempts to cast cripple on Leanine; Leanine identifies it with a Spellcraft check and successfully counters it with dispel magic. She then decides to reflect the spell onto Alastair. She spends a 2nd-level spell slot (because cripple is a 2nd-level spell). Alastair casts cripple on himself, with the duration, save DC and other pertinent information based on his statistics, as normal. Leanine expended two spell slots - a 3rd-level slot for dispel magic and a 2nd-level slot for the reflection - to reflect Alastair's cripple.
Ride Bareback	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You do not need a saddle or bridle to guide a mount.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Ride 1 rank.	BENEFIT:You do not take a penalty on Ride checks when riding bareback. You gain a +1 bonus on all Ride checks. Normal: A character who rides bareback takes a -5 penalty on Ride checks. Special: Warriors can select Ride Bareback as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Ride-By Attack	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can make attacks from a moving mount.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.	BENEFIT:When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round cannot exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent you attack. Special: Warriors can select Ride-By Attack as one of their warrior bonus feats.
Run	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You run faster than normal.	BENEFIT:When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see Chapter 5: Skills, "Jump"), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While running, you retain your Agility bonus to AC. Normal: You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load); and you lose your Agility bonus to AC.
Scavenge Materials	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Technology	DESC:You are adept at making do with whatever materials come to hand.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Craft 8 ranks.	BENEFIT:You may build an item using raw materials equivalent to only 1/10 the item's market value. The Craft check DC needed to build the item increases by +10. Special: Tinkers can select Scavenge Materials as one of their tinker bonus feats.
Scribe Scroll	SOURCEPAGE:p.156	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Item Creation	DESC:You can create scrolls.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Caster level 1st.	BENEFIT:You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level x its caster level x 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in experience points and use up raw materials costing 1/2 this base price. Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an experience point cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the experience points when scribing the scroll.
Shield Proficiency	SOURCEPAGE:p.157	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can use a shield.	BENEFIT:You can use a shield and take only the standard penalties. Normal: When you are using a shield with which you are not proficient, you take the shield's armor check penalty on attack rolls and all skill checks that involve moving, including Ride checks. Special: Barbarians, paladins and warriors automatically have Shield Proficiency as a bonus feat. They need not select it.
Shot on the Run	SOURCEPAGE:p.157	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	DESC:You can attack with ranged weapons while you move.

Soft Ground: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints. Firm Ground: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, woods and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (such as thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors) are considered as firm ground. Creatures might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but they leave only occasional or partial footprints. Hard Ground: Any surface that doesn't hold footprints at all (such as bare rock or an indoor floor) is considered as hard ground. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. Creatures leave only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles) of their passing. Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the following table.If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching. Normal: Without this feat, characters can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but they can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, characters can use Search to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage, using the DCs given in Table 6-2, but they can't use Search to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them. Special: Scouts automatically have Track as a bonus feat. They need not select it. Track does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a pass without trace spell.

However, you take a -2 penalty on your attack and damage rolls. Special: The surface need not be perfectly smooth and level; you can use a brick wall or a cobblestone road. If the target has full cover, you can attempt a trick shot, but you must guess at the target's location and he has full concealment from your attack. If you are using a moonglaive and are proficient in its use, you do not take the penalties on attack and damage rolls for performing a trick shot.

When fighting in this way, you suffer a -6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to your off-hand attack.
