Tibbit Racial Traits	KEY:Tibbit ~ Racial Traits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Tibbit Race Trait	DESC:+2 racial bonus on all Spot checks. Tibbits have keen eyes.	DESC:&nl;+2 racial bonus on all Jump and Escape Artist checks. Like their feline cousins, tibbits are quick, nimble, and lithe.	DESC:&nl;Automatic Languages: Common and Feline. The Feline language is spoken by all tibbits and cats with an Intelligence of 3 or higher, allowing a tibbit to use the Diplomacy skill against such felines. This language is part of the felines' racial heritage. Other races cannot master it, nor can they use spells such as tongues to communicate with cats. Bonus Languages: Any. Tibbits travel far and wide and their curiosity pushes them to learn a number of languages.	DESC:&nl;Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass tibbit's rogue class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing. Tibbits excel at keeping a low profile and finding secrets, two tasks for which the rogue is ideally suited.

###Block - Force Missile Mage
Weapons and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Weapons and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:Force missile mages gain no new weapon or armor proficiencies.
Spells				KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:A force missile mage continues training in magic as he gains levels. At each level after 1st, the force missile mage gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If the character has levels in more than one spellcasting class before becoming a force missile mage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of force missile mage for the purposes of determining spells per day.
Bonus Missile			KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Bonus Missile				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:At 1st level, a force missile mage gains increased mastery over his spell of choice. Every time he casts magic missile he creates an addition missile, even if this extra missile exceeds the normal maximum of five missiles that the spell normally allows. Thus, a 1st-level force missile mage/6th-level wizard creates five magic missiles, while a 1st-level force missile mage/8thlevel wizard produces six missiles. At 5th level, the force missile mage benefits from an additional bonus missile. This means that a high-level force missile mage can create up to seven missiles with a single casting of magic missile.
Still Missile			KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Still Missile				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:All of the force missile mage's magic missile spells lack a somatic component. He casts magic missile as if using the Still Spell feat but without an increase in spell level.
Energy Missile			KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Energy Missile				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:A force missile mage becomes intimately attuned to the energies that compose the spell magic missile and may alter them in significant ways. Starting at 2nd level, a force missile mage may add either the acid, cold, electricity, or fire descriptor to any magic missile he casts. The type of energy added to the spell is chosen at the time of casting, and you can choose a different type of energy each time you cast magic missile. This altered descriptor affects all missiles created by a single casting of magic missile. Although still a force spell, any magic missile altered in this way deals additional damage against vulnerable creatures and less damage against creatures with related resistances and immunities.
Swift Shield			KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Swift Shield				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:A force missile mage realizes the need to defend himself against the magic missiles of other Spellcasters. A 2nd-level force missile mage can cast shield once per day as an immediate action. (An immediate action is like a free action, but only one can be made per round.) This spell is cast in addition to the force missile mage's usual number of spells per day and at the force missile mage's highest caster level.
Overpowering Missile		KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Overpowering Missile			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.80	DESC:At 3rd level, the force missile mage's magic missile spells become especially potent, breaking through spell resistance more readily than normal. He gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome a creature's spell resistance with the spell magic missile. This benefit only applies to magic missile spells he casts. In addition, a force missile mage's magic missiles might penetrate shield spells and brooches of shielding. Against such protections, the force missile mage makes a caster level check with a DC equal to the caster level, in the case of shield, or DC 20, in the case of a brooch.
Reflective Shield			KEY:Force Missile Mage ~ Reflective Shield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Force Missile Mage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.80	DESC:At 4th level, a force missile mage can reflect the spell magic missile. For the purposes of being affected by magic missile, a force missile mage is constantly treated as being under the effect of the spell spell turning, thus reflecting offensive magic missiles back at their caster. If that caster is protected by the shield spell or a brooch of shielding, these reflected magic missiles are negated as normal. Missiles reflected back against a caster who also has spell turning in effect require the force missile mage to roll on the spell turning mishap chart (Player's Handbook, page 283).
