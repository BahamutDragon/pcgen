# Initiate of the Platinum Dragon

Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Initiates of the Platinum Dragon are proficient with all simple weapons, the longsword (Paladine's favored weapon), with all types of armor, and with shields.
Spells Per Day			KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Spells Per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:An Initiate of the Platinum Dragon continues advancing in divine spellcasting ability as well as learning skills of protecting the innocent. Thus, when an Initiate of the Platinum Dragon level is gained, the character gains new divine spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefits a character of their class would have gained. This means that he adds the level of Initiate of the Platinum Dragon to the level of another divine spellcasting class the character has, and then determines spells per day accordingly. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before he became an Initiate of the Platinum Dragon, the player must decide which class to assign each level of Initiate of the Platinum Dragon for the purposes of determining divine spells per day.
Detect Evil				KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Detect Evil				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 1st level, an Initiate of the Platinum Dragon can detect evil at will as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effects of the spell of the same name. If the character is already able to detect evil at will, these abilities do not stack.
Protection from Evil		KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Protection from Evil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:One of the Initiate's most important duties is to serve and protect the innocent from the clutches of evil. Starting at 2nd level, The Initiate of the Platinum Dragon can use the spell-like ability protection from evil once per day on himself or anyone he needs to protect. At 4th, 6th, and 8th levels, the Initiate can use this more times per day.
Strength of Faith			KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Strength of Faith			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The Initiate of the Platinum Dragon has such strength of faith that through his words and deeds he can sometimes inspire action and courage within those who might otherwise be uninspired. At 2nd level this takes the form of a bonus to Diplomacy and morale checks when dealing with non-evil aligned humanoids. At 2nd level this bonus is +2, it increases to +4 at 5th, +6 at 7th, and finally +8 at 10th. For example, a crusading Initiate of 5th level may well be able to persuade a chaotic good ranger to join him in his quest.
Holy Weapon				KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Holy Weapon				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, any weapon the Initiate of the Platinum Dragon uses against the forces of evil is considered to be a Holy weapon, similar to the Holy Weapon special ability found in the Dungeon Master's Guide. However, it initially only does 1d6 extra holy (good) damage. At 6th and 9th levels, the extra holy damage increases by +1d6 (so at 6th level the holy damage is 2d6 and at 9th level the holy damage is 3d6). This is a supernatural ability. This extra damage is not damaging to anyone other than evil creatures. The weapons immediately lose their holy ability if in the hands of someone other than the Initiate. This holy damage does not stack with a weapon that already has the Holy ability on it (so a holy longsword does not do +5d6 points of holy damage in the hands of a 10th level Initate of the Platinum Dragon).
Paladine's Blessing		KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Paladine's Blessing			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Beginning at 5rd level, an Initiate of the Platinum Dragon gains the ability to designate one set of armor, including shield, as blessed by Paladine. This set of armor gains the unique characteristics as follows; +1 total AC bonus versus any evil, this stacks with their normal AC. At 8th level, grapple checks and unarmed attacks made on the Blessed armor by any evil creature suffer a -2 penalty to their rolls. At 10th level, melee touch attacks versus the Blessed armor require a Concentration check. This applies to spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The Initiate of the Platinum Dragon can only ever designate one set of armor/shield as blessed. If this set is destroyed or lost, it can never be replaced. If the shield that was Blessed is lost or destroyed, the armor loses its bonus to AC versus evil only. The Blessed armor has these qualities only when worn by an Initiate of the Platinum Dragon. For anyone else, it acts as it normally would.
Turn Evil				KEY:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon ~ Turn Evil					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Initiate of the Platinum Dragon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 10th level, the Initiate of the Platinum Dragon becomes so powerful with Paladine's infused holy power that he may turn any evil creatures, just like turning undead. This ability acts the same as turning undead; however, the Initiate of the Platinum Dragon cannot rebuke or control any evil creature. In addition, the Initiate of the Platinum Dragon cannot destroy evil creatures. He can however send the evil creature back to its native plane if he doubles its hit dice in turning damage (assuming of course the evil creature turned is not already in their native plane). The Initiate of the Platinum Dragon is also so powerful in the ways of Paladine that he adds +1d6 extra turning damage to his roll. He also gains a +1 divine bonus to his check to see the number of Hit Dice he can turn. Extra Turning stacks with this ability.
