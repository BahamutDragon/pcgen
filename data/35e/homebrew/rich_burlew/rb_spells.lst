Animorph
Transmutation
Level: Druid 4, Sor/Wiz 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing living creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You transform the target into the shape of an animal, granting it the Polymorphed template for the duration of the spell. This replaces any existing Polymorphed template the creature may have had. The assumed shape must be the most common form of any creature of the Animal or Magical Beast type, subject to the following restrictions:
The total Hit Dice of the creature must be equal to or lower than your caster level.
The size of the creature can be no larger than one size greater than the target, and no smaller than Fine.
The creature cannot be one with a template.
The creature cannot have the Swarm subtype.
The creature may be the adult form of the creature or any younger form.
You must be familiar with the kind of creature chosen. The details of what constitutes "familiarity" are left up to the DM, though encountering the creature of that kind in the flesh certainly qualifies.
You are free to designate the cosmetic appearance of the assumed shape, choosing the hair color, hair texture, eye color, height, and weight, within the normal range for creatures of that kind. If the base creature possessed the Shapechanger subtype before gaining the Polymorphed template, they may revert to their original form (that is, lose the Polymorphed template altogether) as a standard action. If slain, the subject reverts to their original form.

This spell dispels animal growth, enlarge person, and reduce person if the target is affected by these spells.

Anthromorph
Transmutation
Level: Bard 5, Sor/Wiz 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing living creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

This spell functions as animorph, except that the assumed shape must be of the Fey, Humanoid, Giant, or Monstrous Humanoid type.

Aeromorph/Geomorph/Hydromorph/Pyromorph
Transmutation
Level: Druid 7, Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing living creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

This spell functions as animorph, except that the assumed shape must be of the Elemental type, or of the Outsider type with the Air, Earth, Fire, or Water subtype. In addition, you may also grant the target the form of an Animal or Magical Beast with any inherent template that would cause the creature to gain the Elemental type. 

When you use this spell to take the form of a creature with the Air, Earth, Fire, or Water subtypes, it is a spell of that type. For example, aeromorph is an air spell when used to take the form of a djinni. While the spell is often called by the name that reflects the element being chosen, it is still one spell, not four separate ones.

Xenomorph
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing living creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

This spell functions as animorph, except that the assumed shape must be of the Aberration, Ooze, or Vermin type.

Planomorph
Transmutation
Level: Clr 7, Sor/Wiz 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing living creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

This spell functions as animorph, except that the assumed shape must be of the Outsider type and not possess the Air, Earth, Fire, or Water subtypes. In addition, you may also grant the target the form of an Animal or Magical Beast with the Celestial or Fiendish templates (but not Half-Celestial or Half-Fiend templates) applied. At the DM's discretion, there may be additional templates allowed based on other Outsider types.

For the duration of the spell, your natural weapons and any weapons you wield are treated as aligned with any alignment subtype your assumed shape would have (Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful), though you do not actually gain that subtype. When you use this spell to take the form of a creature with one or more of these subtypes, it is a spell of that type. For example, planomorph is a Chaotic and Evil spell when used to take the form of a demon. 

Dracomorph
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 8
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing living creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
The target takes on the form of a mighty dragon. This spell functions as animorph, except that the assumed shape must be of the Dragon type and may be up to two sizes larger than the target's normal size. 
In addition, once during the spell's duration, the target may use the breath weapon (if any) of the assumed shape as a standard action. The damage, area, and energy type are identical to those of the assumed shape at that particular age category. The saving throw for the breath weapon is equal to 10 + 1/2 the subject's HD + the subject's Con modifier (which is itself modified by the dracomorph spell).

Infinimorph
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You gain absolute control of your form. Once per round as a free action, you may apply or remove the Polymorphed template; the assumed shape may be a creature with any type. Any assumed shape must be the most common form of any creature type and may be of any size (from Fine to Colossal) or stage of development. The assumed shape chosen must be a creature that conforms to the following restrictions:
The total Hit Dice of the creature must be equal to or lower than twice your caster level.
The creature may not have more than one template applied. Further, any template cannot be one that increases the Challenge Rating of the creature by an amount greater than one-quarter your caster level.
You must be familiar with the kind of creature chosen. The details of what constitutes "familiarity" are left up to the DM, though encountering the creature of that kind in the flesh certainly qualifies.

Other than the wider range of available shapes and the ability to change shape repeatedly, this spell functions as animorph.


###Block: Additional
Alter
Transmutation
Level: Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing living creature
Duration: 1 hour./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You alter the surface features of the target creature to look different in some way. You need not limit your alterations to what would be the natural range of choices for the target creature; indeed, you may alter the creature's appearance so dramatically (within the guidelines presented below) that it appears to be a member of another species entirely--even a species that does not exist! You must stay within the general range of the creature's type, however; you cannot make a human look exactly like a bear, for example, but you could make him look like a bear-like humanoid, even if you have no knowledge of such a humanoid race existing.

You may change the target's coloration, skin texture, facial features, or other topographical details as you wish. You may lengthen or shorten their hair, or cause the appearance of hair or fur to grow where it did not before. You may increase or decrease their height slightly, as long as they remain within the same size class. You may cause them to appear to gain or lose body fat or muscle, giving them the appearance of being up to 25%% heavier or lighter, though their actual mass does not change. You may make the creature appear to be of the opposite gender, or of no gender. You may shape the creature's flesh to give it imitation claws, horns, or fangs, or other features, though any such changes are nonfunctional and cannot be used as natural weapons. You can even make the creature look as if it has additional limbs, such as a tail or wings or an extra arm, but they cannot be used (or even moved) by the subject unless they normally possess such a limb. You may not create additional working hands from feet or other limbs, nor can you reduce the number of limbs on the creature. You may not make any changes to the creature's skeleton or internal organs at all.

Alter does not change the target's existing equipment or possessions in any way. However, you can create the appearance of equipment that does not exist, as long as the creature does not have any equipment filling that body slot. For example, you could make the creature appear to be wearing a helmet if it is not, but if the creature were wearing an actual hat or helmet, you could not hide the fact. No equipment mimicked in this way can be used to make an attack or provide any AC, skill, or save bonuses of any kind; it is completely nonfunctional. It i, in fact, a part of the creature, and cannot be removed or separated from it.

Alter counts as a disguise on the target creature, and grants +6 shapechanging bonus and a +4 circumstance bonus to your Disguise check. You may alter a creature that has been granted the Polymorphed template, but note that alter cannot change a creature's size or fundamental structure, so that you cannot anthromorph oneself into a troll and then use alter to appear human. Applying the Polymorphed also template dispels alter, if the subject is under this spell's effects. A true seeing spell reveals the target's natural appearance.

Material Component: A tiny lump of blue clay.


Animorph, Mass
Transmutation
Level: Animal 7, Druid 8
Components: V, S, DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: Up to one willing living creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other.
Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

As animorph, except that you apply the Polymorphed template to up to one willing creature per caster level. You must choose the same assumed shape for all of the targets, and it must be of the Animal type (not the Magical Beast type). Recipients remain in the animal shape until the spell expires or you choose to dismiss it for all targets. In addition, each subject may choose to remove the template (and thus return to their true form) as a full-round action. 


Necromorph
Transmutation
Level: Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 4
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: Willing undead creature touched
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You may change the shape of an undead creature, granting it the Polymorphed template. This spell works exactly as Animorph, except as noted above and in the choice of assumed shape, which must be that of an untemplated creature of the Undead type, or else an Animal, Giant, Humanoid, Magical Beast, or Monstrous Humanoid with the Skeleton or Zombie template.

Material Component: A mummified caterpillar.


Turn to Frog
Transmutation
Level: Druid 5, Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One living creature
Duration: 1 day/level (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates, Will partial (see text)
Spell Resistance: Yes

You turn one creature into a frog (or, at DM's discretion, a similar inoffensive Diminutive creature with a Challenge Rating less than 1). The creature gains the Polymorphed template with frog as the assumed shape. None of the creature's equipment or carried objects are changed or meld into its new form.

If the target fails its initial Fortitude save, it must also immediately make a secondary Will save. If this also fails, the target cannot use any extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities for the duration of the spell, and gains the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of a frog. 

Material Component: A live insect and a tiny gold crown worth 5 gp.


Transmogrification
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 8
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One nonmagical object of up to 100 cu. ft./level, or one willing construct
Duration: 1 day/level (for objects) or 10 min./level (for construct creatures) (D)
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (see text)
Spell Resistance: No

You may change any object into any other object, or a creature into an object. You may not increase the size of the target, though you may decrease it as much as you like. The final object must be composed entirely of the same substance, even if the target is not, and you may only create a single object. For example, you could turn a horse into a simple longsword (composed entirely of steel), but not a crossbow (composed of wood, string, and metal). You also could not create a pile of copper coins, though you could create either a single copper coin or a large block of copper. 

A creature turned into an object has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores for as long as the spell is in effect. They are not dead, and cannot be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected. However, they are no longer living creatures, either, and cannot be targeted by spells that do not target objects. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force.

Certain metals have resonances that cannot be duplicated by this spell: gold, silver, platinum, adamantine, mithral, mercury, gemstones, and certain other metals (at the DM's discretion) cannot be created by this spell, though they can be turned into something else. This is part of the reasons why these metals have their value in the first place, and why so many wizards search for the means to turn lead into gold. While iron is viable, any iron objects created do not have the special properties of cold iron. You can create dead organic material, such as wood, rope, bone, or leather, but the object must still be entirely of the same substance, which means you cannot create a complete corpse (which contains dead flesh, bone, blood, hair, etc.).

Because the spell is permanent, the object created radiates magic and can be dispelled. You cannot create magic items or creatures of any kind (living or not). Magic items cannot be targeted, but any spell cast on the target (even permanently) continues to be active. Only creatures or objects attended by a creature receive a saving throw.

You may also use this spell to grant the Polymorphed template to one willing construct. You may give the construct the shape of any Aberration, Animal, Construct, Fey, Giant, Humanoid, Magical Beast, Monstrous Humanoid, or Vermin type. The construct retains the appearance of the substance that it is constructed from, so that an iron golem transmogrified into a griffon looks like an iron griffon. Unlike most applications of the Polymorphed template, the construct may keep its own natural armor bonus if it is higher than that of the assumed shape.

Material Component: A bit of gum arabic and a drop of mercury.


###Block: Info -
#Spell Changes: The following are minor changes that need to be applied to existing spells to bring them in line with the new Polymorph rules:
#Alter Self: This spell is deleted and replaced by alter.
#Animal Growth: This spell cannot target a creature that has had the Polymorphed template applied.
#Animal Shapes: This spell is deleted and replaced by mass animorph.
#Baleful Polymorph: This spell is deleted and replaced by turn to frog.
#Enlarge Person: This spell cannot target a creature that has had the Polymorphed template applied.
#Polymorph: This spell is deleted.
#Polymorph Any Object: This spell is deleted and partially replaced by transmogrification. Other effects are deliberately removed as problematic, such as the ability to turn pebbles into humans.
#Reduce Person: This spell cannot target a creature that has had the Polymorphed template applied.
#Righteous Might: If the target of the spell has the Polymorphed template, they do not increase in size. They do not gain size bonuses to Strength or Constitution.

They still gain the damage reduction and natural armor enhancement effects.
#Shapechange: This spell is deleted and replaced by infinimorph.



Annihilation Gaze
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 8
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Reflex negates
Spell Resistance: No
----You meet the eye of a single creature and destroy it utterly, turning its body to a fine ash. The creature can attempt a Reflex save to avoid your gaze attack, but it is otherwise unable to shrug off the effects. Closing one's eyes quickly cannot guarantee total safety, as even a glimpse of your baleful eye nauseates the target for 2d6 rounds. Any effect that normally blocks or hampers gaze attacks are effective against the annihilation gaze, including concealment (which provides a miss chance) or complete blindness.

Empower Construct
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 8
Components: S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: One construct
Duration: 1 minute/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: No
----This spell enhances the natural connection between you and a construct that you created personally, allowing you to enhance your creation with impressive combat powers. The construct grows one size category, granting it a size bonus to Strength (+2 if the new size is Tiny, +4 if it is Small or Medium, or +8 if Large or bigger) and a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. It suffers standard penalties to its AC and attack rolls based on its new size. It may gain additional temporary hit points to bring it up to the amount appropriate for a construct of its new size; for example, a Medium construct that normally gains 20 bonus hit points for its size would gain an additional 10 hit points when it becomes Large. If the construct uses equipment, it grows in size to match as per the spell enlarge person.
----The construct gains a base attack bonus equal to your caster level (unless its own base attack bonus is higher), and if forced to make a saving throw, may use the your base saving throw bonus or its own, whichever is greater. The construct's natural armor bonus increases by +8, and the material of the construct hardens, giving it Hardness equal to one-half your caster level. This does not stack with any existing Hardness or damage reduction the construct might possess.
----Material Component: A small piece of the material from which the construct was made.

Inversion
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 7
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half
Spell Resistance: Yes
----This spell momentarily turns a creature's body inside out, tearing flesh and badly mutilating the target. The spell then fades, returning the creature to its normal appearance, but not before inflicting 1d6 points of damage per caster level (max 30d6). A successful Fortitude saving throw can reduce this damage by half as the creature struggles to hold itself together. If the creature is killed by the damage from this spell, its body explodes in a shower of gore and is completely unrecognizable. The target's equipment is unaffected (though could probably use a thorough washing).
----Material Component: A full wineskin, which is turned inside out and emptied during the casting.

Reassembly
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 7
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Target: One destroyed construct touched
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
----This spell restores a construct that has been destroyed to working order. You may reassemble a construct that has been destroyed for no longer than one day per level. Only constructs that had Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores before being destroyed can be reassembled; as they have no souls, a construct has no option as to whether they wish to be reassembled or not. Constructs created by a temporary spell cannot be restored, even if the spell in question still has duration remaining. You must have most of the construct's body present, though it need not be in one piece; the body is reconstructed during the casting of the spell, restoring any detached or broken limbs.
----The construct is not quite as good as new after the process, permanently losing 1 Hit Die (or character level, if it has any). A construct with only 1 Hit Die cannot be reassembled. The reassembled creature has a number of hit points equal to its new Hit Dice total, though it can be subsequently repaired by other means.
----Material Component: Emeralds worth a total of at least 5000 gp.

Softening
Transmutation
Level: Sor/Wiz 3
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: Ray
Duration: 1 round/level or until discharged
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes
----A blue beam of energy springs from your hand, disrupting the molecules of any creature you strike. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to the next Fortitude saving throw it makes equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+10).

Creature Sense
Divination
Level: Sor/Wiz 6
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Area: Circle, centered on you, with a radius of 400 ft. + 40 ft./level
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
----You gain an immediate mental impression of nearby monsters, learning the distance, direction, size, and type (but not subtype) of all creatures within range. You do not learn the specific kind of creature; for example, a minotaur would register only as a Large monstrous humanoid. This spell can be fooled by misdirection, nondetection, or polymorph magic. It can be blocked by a thin sheet of lead, but otherwise penetrates solid earth easily.
----Material Component: The brain of a bat.

Sense of Timing
Divination
Level: Sor/Wiz 7
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Touch
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: No
----The creature touched gains a powerful instinct about when attacks are occurring, allowing him to take dangerous or even foolhardy actions in the middle of battle with near-impunity. While benefiting from this sense of timing, the target does not provoke any attacks of opportunity for the duration of the spell, regardless of his actions. The target may choose to ignore his senses if, for some reason, he wishes to provoke an attack of opportunity. In addition, the target fights as if he knew the Combat Reflexes feat for the duration of the spell, allowing him to take advantage of openings he would normally miss.
----Focus: A tiny hourglass, filled with diamond dust, worth 500 gp.

Terrible Secret
Divination
Level: Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Will half (see below)
Spell Resistance: No
----This spell uses powerful divination magic to access a secret that was never meant to be known; a sanity-shattering truth that tears at one's brain from within, threatening to destroy it. Unlike other divinations, though, you do not unveil this knowledge unto yourself when casting this spell. You instead reveal this terrible secret to one other creature, whispering in horrific insights into its ear, hoping this will cause his brain to explode at the very understanding of it.
----Knowledge of the secret inflicts 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) if it fully understood. The target can attempt to shut out knowledge with a successful Will save, which reduces the damage by half. The more intelligent the target, however, the more difficult it is to resist the urge to understand the secret. The target adds his Intelligence modifier to the Will saving throw DC, so that the secret is less effective on the blissfully ignorant. Creatures without an Intelligence score ignore this spell entirely, as do deific beings (as they presumably have the faculties to actually accept the secret as fact). Because the secret is whispered to the target, deafened creatures or those in a magical area of silence are also protected. The secret automatically adapts to any language the target knows, or is transmitted as a series of sounds of such primal significance that even the language-deficient can grasp them.
----The secret is such that the non-divine mind cannot grasp it for long, and it mostly fades from the target's memory after being revealed. Any creature that has been exposed to the secret remembers enough to help it resist the urge to look or listen should it be revealed again, granting it a +4 circumstance bonus to Will saves against this spell in the future.
----Focus: The preserved brain of an outsider with an Intelligence score of 14 or higher.

Terrible Revelation
Divination
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Targets: All living creatures within range
----As terrible secret, except this spell reveals the knowledge to all creatures within range. You and up to one creature per caster level of your choice may be shielded from the secret.
----Focus: The preserved brain of an outsider with an Intelligence score of 22 or higher.


Banality
Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Assassin 4, Sor/Wiz 5, Brd 4
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
Area: 400 ft. + 40 ft./level emanation centered on you or object touched.
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: Will partial
Spell Resistance: No
----You cloud the minds of all creatures in the area, causing them to see you as dull, inconsequential, and unappealing. You do not know what others see specifically, however; everyone sees their own personalized image of absolute blandness appropriate to your surroundings. For example, while standing in the king's court, onlookers might see you as just another courtier, but while passing through an orcish village, anyone looking would see yet another unwashed orc grunt. This has two direct effects:
Any creature in the area suffers a -5 circumstance penalty to any Spot checks opposed to your Hide or Disguise skill checks, and you can use the Hide skill with regard to such creatures even when they are directly observing you. They also suffer a -5 circumstance penalty to any Listen check to hear you, as their befuddled mind rationalizes any sounds you make as being normal ambient noise.
Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack you, even with a targeted spell, must make a Will save (with a +4 circumstance bonus if you have made a physical attack against that opponent during the current encounter). If successful, they may attack normally and need make no further Will saves to attack you for the remainder of the spell (though they are still affected by the first effect). If the save fails, the opponent is fooled into believing you are too insignificant to waste the energy required to attack you. The opponent cannot follow through with the attack, though they do not realize that this decision has not been made of their own volition. They are still free to use the action they would have employed against you to take any other course of action, including attacking a different creature. They are also free to attempt a new Will save on any subsequent round if they wish to attack you.
----You may also cast this spell on an unattended object, which causes it to appear exactly as any other nearby object of the same type. Creatures affected suffer a -10 circumstance penalty to their Search and Spot checks to locate an object emanating banality. This form of the spell can be made the subject of a permanency spell by an 11th level or higher caster who spends 1500 XP. 

False Trail
Illusion (Glamer)
Level: Sor/Wiz 2
Components: V, S, M
Range: Touch
Target: One creature/level
Duration: 1 hour/level; see text. (D)
Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with)
Spell Resistance: No
----The subjects leave behind an illusion covering their footprints as they travel, causing any creature following to misidentify their tracks. Each subject's tracks will appear to have been left by another kind of creature (up to one size larger or smaller than the subject) with which you are familiar. You may cause different subjects to leave different tracks as desired; for example, you might cause a group of five humans to leave tracks resembling three ogres and two dire wolves. The illusion also contains an olfactory component and can thus fool creatures that track with scent as easily as those that use their eyes.
----Finding tracks left behind by a creature under the effects of this spell is not inherently more difficult than normal, though the Survival skill check DC is based on the size of the creature whose tracks are being imitated. Any creature interacting with the false trail (either by touching or smelling the tracks) gets a Will saving throw to recognize them as false. The illusion on the tracks themselves lingers for 1 day/caster level, during which time they radiate magic and can be dispelled.
----Material Component: A few hairs from a skunk's tail.

Imperceptible
Illusion (Glamer)
Level: Sor/Wiz 9
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 10 min./level (D; see text)
----You become undetectable to all senses save touch, even those that are heightened or magically enhanced. You are invisible as if under the effect of greater invisibility, and cannot be seen even by creatures using see invisibility or true seeing. Any object of Fine size or smaller that touches you is turned invisible as well, preventing you from being discovered by glitterdust, dust of appearance, or similar methods and negating any penalty to you Hide checks from such a source. You remain invisible in the area of any spell that would cancel or reveal it, such as invisibility purge, and are immune to faerie fire. Discovering your location is more difficult as a result of these subtle improvements; while the Spot DC for noticing your presence remains the same, observers must beat the DC by 30 in order to pinpoint your location (rather than by 20 as normal).
----The spell masks all sounds (including sonic effects) from leaving the space you occupy, but does not prevent sounds from entering. This makes you effectively silent to others but does not prevent you from listening to your surroundings. It also does not prevent you from speaking, such as to cast spells with a verbal component, though your voice cannot be heard by any creature not occupying the same space. You cannot be sensed by blindsense, blindsight, or tremorsense, and neither do you register as a "blank spot" to creatures with these abilities. Your odor is completely neutralized, and you cannot be sensed or tracked by a creature using the scent special ability. You leave no footprints or tracks at all, as if under the effect of pass without trace. 
----Your imperceptible nature allows you to be ignored by all forms of divination spells and effects that would detect your presence or any information about you, including all detect spells, arcane eye, arcane sight, clairaudience/clairvoyance, discern location, locate object, scrying or any similar spell lower than 9th level. You do not trigger any magical effect that would normally react to your presence, such as alarm or glyph of warding, though you can still activate spells that trigger when read (such as explosive runes or symbol of pain).
----At any point, you may temporarily suppress the effects of this spell as a free action. As long as the spell's duration has not expired, you may subsequently return to your imperceptible state as a standard action.
----Material Component: The eyeball of a creature capable of using true seeing, either as a spell or spell-like ability. The eyeball is swallowed during the casting of the spell.

Phantasmal Bane
Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affecting]
Level: Bard 5, Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V, S, F
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Target: One creature
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Will disbelief
Spell Resistance: No
----You create the false impression in the mind of one creature that the melee weapon you are holding is crafted from the most deadly and baneful substance it can imagine. The subject gets a Will saving throw to recognize the illusion the first time anyone attacks it with the weapon. If it fails the save, all attacks with the weapon are treated as if they were made by an attack form to which the creature is particularly vulnerable, allowing those attacks to deal full damage to most creatures with damage reduction. To a creature that believes the illusion, the phantasmal bane can inflict wounds as if was magical, was crafted of any given substance (silver, cold iron, or adamantine), dealt any type of weapon damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), or was dedicated to any given alignment. The weapon cannot overcome damage reduction that has no vulnerability (such as that of an elemental or high-level barbarian), and cannot overcome the damage reduction of creatures vulnerable only to Epic weapons (such as that of a solar). Phantasmal bane has no effect against creatures without any form of damage reduction. 
----Because the illusion exists entirely in the target's mind, you gain no knowledge about what sort of weapon to which the target might otherwise be vulnerable. Any specific creature can only be under the effect of one casting of phantasmal bane at any time.
----Focus: A single melee weapon, held during casting. You may pass the weapon to another creature after the spell is cast.

Sensory Overload
Illusion (Figment)
Level: Sor/Wiz 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Targets: One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 60 ft. apart
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Will partial
Spell Resistance: No
----You fill the target creatures' senses with a kaleidoscope of colors, a cacophony of sounds, and a pungent swirl of odors. Overwhelmed with these impressions, each subject must make a Will saving throw or be stunned and unable to act. Even if a subject sees through the illusion, it is still sickened by the sensory overload for the duration of the spell.
----This spell has a particularly insidious effect against a creature using true seeing at the moment it is targeted. Rather than allowing it to ignore the sensory overload, the true seeing actually magnifies the effect, causing the subject to see the truth about everything, all at once. If a subject using true seeing is stunned by this spell, it must make a second Will saving throw or be driven permanently insane by the experience (as the spell insanity).
