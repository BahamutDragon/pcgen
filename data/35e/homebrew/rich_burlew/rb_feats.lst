New Epic Feats:

Improved Ancestral Weapon [Epic] 
Your Ancestral Weapon is the stuff of legends. 
Prerequisites: Ancestral Weapon with at least 2 Greater Powers. 
Benefit: The spirit of your ancestor increases all of its ability scores by two. The weapon also gains the use of a Superior Power; the DM chooses any one 5th or 6th level spell; the Ancestral Weapon may now activate that spell as a spell-like ability, three times per day. Alternately, the DM may choose a 3rd or 4th level spell that can be used as a spell-like ability at will, or two 1st or 2nd level spells that can be used as a free action at will. The power should reflect the personality and nature of the ancestor inhabiting the weapon; the tables for random determination of an intelligent item's greater powers may be used instead. The spirit uses its highest ability score to determine the saving throw DC, if necessary, and the caster level is equal to the bearer's class level. 
Special: You may take this feat up to three times.

Epic Ancestral Weapon [Epic] 
Your Ancestral Weapon has reached the peak of its power. 
Prerequisites: Ancestral Weapon with at least 3 Superior Powers. 
Benefit: The spirit of your ancestor increases all of its ability scores by two. The weapon also gains the use of an Supreme Power; the DM chooses any one 7th or 8th level spell; the Ancestral Weapon may now activate that spell as a spell-like ability, three times per day. Alternately, the DM may choose a 5th or 6th level spell that can be used as a spell-like ability at will, or two 3rd or 4th level spells that can be used as a free action at will. The power should reflect the personality and nature of the ancestor inhabiting the weapon; the tables for random determination of an intelligent item's greater powers may be used instead. The spirit uses its highest ability score to determine the saving throw DC, if necessary, and the caster level is equal to the bearer's class level. 
Special: You may take this feat up to three times.

New Champion Feats

As mentioned in the previous post, one of the drawbacks to playing the champion is the lack of feat support. So I've created 20 new feats to help players out.

Aesetic Avatar
Your avatar possesses a unique but deadly calm.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, Flurry of Blows class feature.
Benefit: Your champion and monk levels stack for purposes of determining your avatar's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, and skill points. You may use your monk unarmed damage, ki strike, AC bonus, and unarmored speed bonus while in avatar form, and you may make a flurry of blows attack. You may freely multiclass between monk and champion levels.
Special: Both the champion and the avatar must take this feat in order to gain its benefits.
Special: If playing with the gestalt variant rules, combine your total champion and monk levels to determine your avatar's total number of Hit Dice, even if you gain a level from each class at the same character level. Your avatar cannot have more Hit Dice than you have character levels + 4.
Normal: Your avatar's abilities are based solely on your champion levels, and you cannot use any class abilities in avatar form.

Avatar Kinship
Your avatar starts to take on some of your own racial characteristics.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability.
Benefit: Your avatar gains the following racial abilities if your race possesses them: Racial skill bonuses, racial saving throw bonuses, racial attack bonuses against certain enemies or with certain weapons, low-light vision, or scent. If your race possesses a natural armor bonus, your avatar gains this as well, but not any natural armor bonus acquired through feats or class abilities. Finally, your avatar is considered to be a member of your race (in addition to being an Outsider) for purposes of magic items, spells, or class abilities that target certain races.
Special: This feat must be taken by your avatar, not your champion, in order to be effective.
Normal: Your avatar gains no racial abilities other than ability score adjustments.

Avatar Knight
Your avatar is a paragon of chivalry.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, Smite Evil class ability.
Benefit: Your champion and paladin levels stack for purposes of determining your avatar's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, and skill points. You may use your divine grace, smite evil, and lay on hands class abilities while in avatar form. You may freely multiclass between paladin and champion levels.
Special: Both the champion and the avatar must take this feat in order to gain its benefits.
Special: If playing with the gestalt variant rules, combine your total champion and paladin levels to determine your avatar's total number of Hit Dice, even if you gain a level from each class at the same character level. Your avatar cannot have more Hit Dice than you have character levels + 4.
Normal: Your avatar's abilities are based solely on your champion levels, and you cannot use any class abilities in avatar form.

Avatar Mount
When you change to avatar form, your trusty mount does, too.
Prerequisite: Avatar Knight, paladin mount class ability.
Benefit: When you change to avatar form, you may choose to transform your special paladin mount to match your avatar form if it is within 30 feet of you. In its transformed state, your mount has the same energy resistance and damage reduction you have and gains temporary hit points equal to its normal maximum hit points (effectively doubling its hit points). The mount also takes on a specific appearance that matches or compliments your avatar's appearance. When you return to your champion form, your mount loses these benefits.
Special: This feat must be taken by your avatar, not your champion, in order to be effective.
Spoiler


Avatar Training
You have given up some of your knowledge in order that your avatar might learn more.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability.
Benefit: Your avatar learns one feat of your choice. Your avatar must meet all prerequisites for that feat as normal.
Normal: Your avatar only gains one feat every three character levels.
Special: You may take this feat multiple times.

Charging Transformation
You channel the power of your transformation into a thunderous blow.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability.
Benefit: When you change to avatar form during the same round as you charge, you gain a bonus to your weapon damage roll equal to your champion level. If you are capable of making more than one attack at the end of a charge, this bonus only applies to the first such attack.

Crisis Transformationa
Your avatar can step in and save the day when needed.
Prerequisite: Hero Form 3/day.
Benefit: While in champion form, if you would be reduced to 0 or less hit points by an attack or spell, you can change to avatar form as an immediate action by making a Will saving throw (DC=damage dealt). If successful, the damaging attack or spell affects the avatar instead, reduced by any applicable resistances the avatar might have. You may not use this feat if you do not have any daily uses of your Hero Form ability remaining or if your avatar has already been reduced to negative hit points or slain.
Special: If you have taken this feat, you may also choose for your avatar to take it. In that case, your avatar may also attempt to turn back to champion form in the same manner when an attack or spell would reduce it to 0 or less hit points.

Divine Avatar
The power of your deity runs more strongly through your avatar than most.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, ability to cast 1st level divine spells.
Benefit: Your champion and divine spellcasting levels stack for purposes of determining your avatar's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, and skill points. 
.....You may cast divine spells from other classes while in avatar form if your avatar has sufficient ability scores to do so. Use your avatar's ability scores to determine saving throw DCs and other effects, but your own casting level. You do not gain or lose bonus spells while in avatar form, regardless of how much your primary spellcasting score may change.
Special: Both the champion and the avatar must take this feat in order to gain its benefits.
Special: If playing with the gestalt variant rules, combine your total champion and divine spellcasting levels to determine your avatar's total number of Hit Dice, even if you gain a level from each class at the same character level.

Normal: Your avatar's abilities are based solely on your champion levels, and you cannot cast spells while in avatar form.

Dragonblooded Avatar
Your avatar is imbued with arcane power.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, ability to cast 1st level arcane spells.
Benefit: Your champion and levels that grant arcane spellcasting ability stack for purposes of determining your avatar's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, and skill points. 
.....You may cast arcane spells from other classes while in avatar form if your avatar has sufficient ability scores to do so. Use your avatar's ability scores to determine saving throw DCs and other effects, but your own casting level. You do not gain or lose bonus spells while in avatar form, regardless of how much your primary spellcasting score may change.
Special: Both the champion and the avatar must take this feat in order to gain its benefits.
Special: If playing with the gestalt variant rules, combine your total champion and arcane spellcasting levels to determine your avatar's total number of Hit Dice, even if you gain a level from each class at the same character level. Your avatar cannot have more Hit Dice than you have character levels + 4.
Normal: Your avatar's abilities are based solely on your champion levels, and you cannot cast spells while in avatar form.

Extra Hero Form

All other creatures within 5 feet of you when you assume your avatar form take 1d6 points of damage from the chosen form of energy for every two champion class levels. Creatures who are not grappling with you can make a Reflex saving throw for half damage with a DC equal to 10 + half your champion class level + your avatar's Constitution bonus. This ability is supernatural in origin.
Special: If you have taken this feat, you may also choose for your avatar to take it. If you do, you gain the same benefit when changing back to your champion form. 
Spoiler


Fearful Transformation
The very act of taking your avatar form is a terror to behold.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability.
Benefit: When you transform to your avatar form, you may make an Intimidate check against every enemy that can see you as a free action (using your avatar's Intimidate skill). If successful, affected enemies are shaken for 1d6 rounds.

Improved Avatar Healing
You are better at regulating the flow of healing energy to your avatar.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, ability to cast cure light wounds.
Benefit: When you cast a cure spell on yourself, you heal both yourself and your avatar the full amount of hit points indicated for that spell.

Improved Avatar Kinship
Your avatar starts to take on more of your own racial characteristics.
Prerequisite: Avatar Kinship, Hero Form class ability.
Benefit: Your avatar may use any spell-like abilities possessed by your race; saving throw DCs are based on the avatar's ability scores, but caster level is the same as when you are in your champion form. In addition, if you have spell resistance from your race, you retain it while in avatar form.
Special: This feat must be taken by your avatar, not your champion, in order to be effective.
Normal: Your avatar gains no racial abilities other than ability score adjustments.

Psychic Avatar
Your avatar can tap in to some of the power of your impressive mind.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, ability to manifest 1st level psionic powers.
Benefit: Your champion and psionic manifester levels stack for purposes of determining your avatar's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, and skill points. You may manifest your psionic powers from other classes while in avatar form if your avatar has sufficient ability scores to do so. Use your avatar's ability scores to determine saving throw DCs and other effects, but your own manifesting level. You do not gain or lose bonus power points while in avatar form, regardless of how much your primary manifesting score may change.
Special: Both the champion and the avatar must take this feat in order to gain its benefits.
Special: If playing with the gestalt variant rules, combine your total champion and psionic manifester levels to determine your avatar's total number of Hit Dice, even if you gain a level from each class at the same character level. Your avatar cannot have more Hit Dice than you have character levels + 4.
Normal: Your avatar's abilities are based solely on your champion levels, and you cannot manifest psionic powers while in avatar form.

Stealthy Transformation
Your avatar is more subtle than most.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability.
Benefit: You do not need to speak a magic word or phrase to change to avatar form, and your transformation does not ruin your Hide checks or grant a bonus to others' Spot checks.
Normal: A champion's transformation requires a spoken word or phrase to take effect. Doing so ruins any attempt to Hide and grants others a +10 to their Spot check to notice your presence.

Stunning Transformation
You unleash a mighty bolt of power when you take your avatar form.
Prerequisite: Hero Form 2/day.
Benefit: When you transform into your avatar form, all enemies within 30 feet must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + champion level + your avatar's Constitution bonus) or be stunned for 1 round.
Special: If you have taken this feat, you may also choose for your avatar to take it. If you do, you gain the same benefit when changing back to your champion form. 

Titanic Avatar
Your avatar is a towering figure.
Prerequisite: Hero Form 3/day.
Benefit: When you take this feat, your avatar form permanently gains the Powerful Build extraordinary ability. Whenever your avatar is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), your avatar is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. Your avatar is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. Your avatar can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, its space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this feat stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category. 
.....If you possess the Avatar Weapon class ability, you may choose to have your avatar weapon increase in size when you transform to accommodate your avatar's Powerful Build.
Normal: Your avatar is a Medium-size creature.

Twilight Avatar
Your avatar is a sneaky bastard.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, Sneak Attack +1d6.
Benefit: Your champion and rogue levels stack for purposes of determining your avatar's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, and skill points. You may make sneak attacks while in avatar form, as well as gain the full benefits of uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.
Special: Both the champion and the avatar must take this feat in order to gain its benefits.
Special: If playing with the gestalt variant rules, combine your total champion and rogue levels to determine your avatar's total number of Hit Dice, even if you gain a level from each class at the same character level. Your avatar cannot have more Hit Dice than you have character levels + 4.
Normal: Your avatar's abilities are based solely on your champion levels, and you cannot use any class abilities in avatar form.

Warrior Avatar
Your avatar is highly skilled in the art of war.
Prerequisite: Hero Form class ability, two or more feats from the list of fighter bonus feats.
Benefit: Your champion and fighter levels stack for purposes of determining your avatar's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throws, and skill points. While in avatar form, you may make use of any feats you possess that are on the list of fighter bonus feats, even if you gained them from another source. Your avatar also becomes proficient in heavy armor.
Special: Both the champion and the avatar must take this feat in order to gain its benefits.
Special: If playing with the gestalt variant rules, combine your total champion and fighter levels to determine your avatar's total number of Hit Dice, even if you gain a level from each class at the same character level. Your avatar cannot have more Hit Dice than you have character levels + 4.
Normal: Your avatar's abilities are based solely on your champion levels, and you cannot use any of your normal feats in avatar form.

Fey Druidic Feats

Changeling (Epic) 
You have embraced your fey heritage, and it has changed you forever. 
Prerequisites: Fey Blood, ability to cast 9th level druid spells. 
Benefits: Your type permanently changes to fey. You are immune to spells that only affect humanoids, such as charm person. You gain low-light vision (if you did not already possess it) and damage reduction 5/cold iron. Your physical appearance takes on fey qualities, such as elongated ears, dark eyes, and elfin features, and you gain a +2 racial bonus to Diplomacy when dealing with members of the opposite gender.

Fey Blood (General) 
You have one or more fey as ancestors, and as a result your druid powers come naturally to you rather than from any great insight into the nature of the world. 
Prerequisites: Cha 11+, ability to speak the Sylvan language, humanoid or giant type. 
Benefit: Your druid spellcasting powers are based on Charisma rather than Wisdom. To prepare or cast a druid spell, you must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, and you gain bonus spells based on your Charisma score. The DC for saving throws against your druid spells is 10 + the spell's level + your Charisma modifier. This feat does not alter the means by which you prepare or cast druid spells; you must still prepare spells in advance, as normal. Because you are using your natural fey connection to nature as the conduit for your magical powers rather than any great insight, your spells are considered to be partially fey magic. Any druid of 4th level or higher with the Resist Nature's Lure class ability gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against your druid spells. 
Special: You may only select this feat at 1st level, though you need not possess the druid class at that time. Your DM may limit this feat to certain appropriate races that would be likely to have crossbred with fey over the history of the campaign world.

Fey Defiance (General) 
Your connection to the spirit of nature allows you to drive off fey creatures without harming them-or protect them from the others who would do so. 
Prerequisites: Cha 11+, ability to speak the Sylvan language, resist nature's lure ability. 
Benefit: You may turn (but not destroy) creatures with the fey type as a good cleric turns undead. The fey's total Hit Dice include those gained from any class levels, and each fey is considered to have Turn Resistance equal to their Charisma bonus. You use your druid level as your turning level, and may activate this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You may also dispel the turning of fey by another druid with this feat as an evil cleric can dispel a good cleric's turning effect. You may instead choose to bolster fey against turning in advance, as an evil cleric may bolster undead. Each of these effects also uses one of your daily turning attempts.

Fey Shape (General) 
Due to your close blood ties, you may turn yourself into the shape of a fey. 
Prerequisites: Fey Blood, wild shape ability (6/day). 
Benefit: You may use your wild shape ability to take the shape of a fey creature with which you are familiar. You gain all of the extraordinary and supernatural abilities of the fey, but not the spells or spell-like abilities. You do not gain supernatural abilities that require a specific fey-crafted object or terrain feature (such as a grig's fiddle, a satyr's pipes, or a dryad's tree dependence), and you may only turn into fey whose Hit Dice are no greater than your druid level. You may not change gender as a result of wild shape, so certain single-gender fey (dryads, nymphs, satyrs) will be unavailable as well. Being in fey shape grants a +10 circumstance bonus for Disguise skill checks when pretending to be a fey.

Leader of the Pack (General) 
Your unique understanding of the effect music has upon animals allows you to inspire your animal friends to greater efficiency. 
Prerequisites: Animal companion ability, bardic music ability 
Benefit: When you use your bardic music ability to inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics in your animal companion, it gains double the normal benefits. For example, a 1st level druid/9th level bard could use inspire courage to grant his animal companion a +4 morale bonus to attack, damage, and saving throws against charm of fear effects, or he could use inspire greatness to grant it +4d10 Hit Dice, a +4 competence bonus to attack and damage, and a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls. 


Fighter Feat Chains

In an article I wrote a while ago, I presented some feats designed to help up the options of the fighter. That article presented feats that were specifically limited to fighters, but these feats are oriented in a different way: most of them have too many prerequisites to be reasonable for other classes. The PHB presents a few feat "chains" and a few feats that are more powerful but balanced by hefty prerequisites. Unfortunately, there are not enough of these to sustain the single class fighter into high-level before he inevitably starts branching out. These feats add to the options available to the fighter by adding some new defensive techniques. With some luck, your fighter should be able to take on a room full of katana-wielding guys in Kato masks and come out victorious.


Accidents Happen [General, Fighter]
The more opponents you fight, the more likely they are to injure each other.
Prerequisites: Dex 13+, Wis 13+, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Interference*, Mobility, base attack bonus +13.
Benefit: If the creature to which you have selected to apply the benefits of the Dodge feat attacks you in melee and misses, you may choose to force it to make an immediate extra attack against any other creature of your choice within its reach that also threatens you. This free attack is at the same attack bonus as the one that missed, and any effects that applied to the original attack against you remain in effect. This feat does not apply if the attack that missed was an attempt to disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip you, nor if it was an attack of opportunity you provoked. This attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round; you may use this feat no more than once per round, even if entitled to multiple attacks of opportunity per round.

Combat Momentum [General, Fighter]
Your attacks gain in power the as you cut through your enemies' ranks.
Prerequisites:Str 13+, Cleave, Great Cleave, Power Attack, base attack bonus +12
Benefit: If you deal a creature enough damage to drop a creature below 0 hit points in melee combat, you gain a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus to damage for all melee weapon attacks until the end of your current action.

Disarming Expert [General, Fighter]
You are an expert at disarming.
Prerequisites: Int 13+, Combat Expertise, Improved Disarm, base attack bonus +7.
Benefit: If you roll a natural 20 during an attempt to disarm a foe, your disarm attempt succeeds, regardless of the final modified attack roll of your foe. You do not suffer any penalty for using a light weapon when attempting to disarm a foe or when a foe attempts to disarm you. 
Normal: Disarm attempts are not automatically successful on a natural roll of 20. Wielders of a light weapon suffer a -4 penalty to make or resist disarm attempts.

Finishing Move [General, Fighter]
You are brutally efficient at making sure your dispatched opponents never get up again.
Prerequisites: Int 13+, Dex 13+, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, base attack bonus +5.
Benefit: If you deal a creature enough damage to drop a creature below 0 hit points in melee combat (but do not kill them), you may, as a free action, twist your weapon in such a way to ensure their death. The opponent suffers additional damage equal to the base damage of your weapon. You may only take one such free action per turn, and you do not gain a Cleave attack (if you are entitled to one) for dropping that foe if you choose to take such an action. 

Flipping Attack [General, Fighter]
You may make a powerful somersaulting attack.
Prerequisites: Dex 13+, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Tumble skill, base attack bonus +4.
Benefit: When you take the charge action, you may continue to move after making the attack portion of the charge. The movement must continue in a straight line, up to a maximum total movement of twice your move speed. Moving in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender you attack, though it might provoke attacks of opportunity from other creatures if possible.
Normal: Using the Spring Attack feat does not normally gain the benefits of the charge action, namely a +2 bonus to the attack roll and the ability to move twice your speed while attacking.

Interference [General, Fighter]
The more opponents you fight, the more likely they are to get in each other's way.
Prerequisites: Dex 13+, Dodge, Mobility.
Benefit: When you are not flat-footed, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class for every two opponents within 5 feet that are threatening you (maximum bonus of +4 if you are completely surrounded).

Touche [General, Fighter]
You may attack a foe after disarming him.
Prerequisites: Int 13+, Combat Expertise, Disarming Expert*, Improved Disarm, base attack bonus +11.
Benefit: If you make a successful disarm attempt, you immediately get a melee attack against that opponent as if you hadn't used your attack for the disarm attempt, using the same attack bonus. This additional attack may not be a trip, disarm, or sunder attempt.

Whirling Defense [General, Fighter]
You spin so quickly when attacking that you nimbly avoid your enemies' counterattacks.
Prerequisites: Dex 13+, Int 13+, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, base attack bonus +11.
Benefit: Whenever you make a whirlwind attack, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your armor class until the beginning of your next turn.

Metamagic Feats

Metamagic feats are a great concept, but unfortunately they are usually limited to mid- to high-level characters due to the necessity of having spell slots of a level higher than the spell's. A rare few metamagic feats published have allowed you to use them without an increase to the level of the spell slot needed. The logic is that the opportunity cost of the feat, coupled with the need to either prepare the metamagic in advance or take extra time at the moment of casting, are enough to balance the feat's power. I like that idea, but so far most of the feats that use that idea are still not useful for low-level characters. So my idea here is to create a few zero-level-increase feats that I could see a low level wizard or sorcerer taking. (One of them ended up being a little too good for zero-level, but I like the idea too much to abandon it.)


Bane Spell [Metamagic]
Choose one creature type from the list of available favored enemies for the ranger class. You can tune your spells to be more effective against that creature type.
Benefit:A bane spell gains a +2 bonus to the DC for any saving throw for any creature of the appropriate type, but suffers a -1 penalty for any creature of a different type. If the spell inflicts one or more dice of damage, every creature of the right type suffers and additional +2d6 points of the same type of damage. A bane spell uses a spell slot of the same level as the spell's actual level.

Lucky Spell [Metamagic]
Your spells frequently have unusually fortuitous results.
Benefit:You may make any spell that heals or inflicts one or more dice of damage into a lucky spell. You may reroll any such dice once, up to a maximum number equal to the level of the spell. For example, you may reroll up to three damage dice from a fireball spell, because it is a 3rd level spell. The new result must be taken, even if it is lower than the original roll. A lucky spell uses a spell slot of the same level as the spell's actual level.

Seeking Spell [Metamagic]
Your ray and energy missile spells are capable of guiding themselves to the target.
Benefit: You may alter any spell that requires a ranged attack roll or ranged touch attack roll so that you take no penalty to your attack roll when firing at a target engaged in melee. If your seeking spell misses due to concealment (but not due to incorporeality), you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit. A seeking spell uses a spell slot of the same level as the spell's actual level.

Suppressible Spell [Metamagic]
You may temporarily dismiss the effects of your spells, restoring them as needed at a later point.
Benefit: You may make any spell that is dismissible by the caster into a suppressible spell. When you would dismiss the spell, you may choose to have the spell be suppressed instead; while all effects of a suppressed spell cease as if it had been dismissed, the spell's duration continues to be counted. While suppressed, the spell is not ended by any action you or the target creature takes that would normally do so. For example, a character under the effects of a suppressed invisibility spell can attack without ending the spell. At any time before the spell's duration fully expires, you may reinstate the spell. Doing so requires the same type of action as casting the spell in the first place, including any verbal or somatic components needed. 
----You must be within the spell's range from the area, object, or creature that was the original target of the spell in order to suppress or reinstate the spell effect. If the spell affected multiple creatures or objects, you may selectively suppress or reinstate the spell's effects on each of the targets currently within range. There is no limit to the number of times a spell may be suppressed or reinstated during the spell's duration, even if the duration has been made permanent with the permanency spell.
----A suppressible spell uses a spell slot of the same level as the spell's actual level.
Normal: Dismissing a spell requires a standard action and ends the spell's effects.

Vicious Spell [Metamagic]
Your spells are particularly devastating, but at a cost to your own health.
Benefit: You may make any spell that heals or inflicts one or more dice of damage with an instantaneous duration into a vicious spell. The total damage caused or healed by the spell is increased by one-quarter; apply this multiplier after all other metamagic effects. However, when you cast the spell, you suffer backlash damage equal to the amount by which the spell's damage is increased. This damage cannot be avoided, prevented, mitigated, or redirected by any means. You suffer the full amount of damage regardless of whether or not the spell's targets make or fail their saving throw (or take any damage whatsoever) or whether the spell is blocked by spell resistance. A vicious spell uses a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.


Tools of the Trade

As a fighter progresses in his career, there is inevitably a point where the quality of his magic equipment is more important than the quality of his training with that equipment. There are simply not enough feats that can be used simultaneously by a high-level fighter; eventually, the fighter begins diversifying rather than specializing.

These feats are a (partial) attempt to reverse that trend by giving a high-level warrior more options that can be used along with the combat techniques learned at lower level. They also share a theme of "equipment mastery." The fighter thus becomes the man or woman who can coax more out of a specific piece of equipment, be it weapon, armor, shield, or even mount.


Armor Focus [General, Fighter] 
Choose any specific type of armor, such as chain mail or full plate armor. You are more adept at moving when wearing that armor. 
Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected armor. 
Benefit: When wearing the selected armor type, the armor check penalty applied to your skills is reduced by 1. This reduction stacks with that granted by masterwork armor, but cannot reduce the total armor check penalty to less than 0. The maximum Dexterity bonus for that armor increases by 1 if the armor is medium or heavy armor. These benefits apply both to standard armor and to armors made of special materials, such as mithral or adamantine. 
Special: You may take this feat multiple times; its effects do not stack. Each time you select it, this feat applies to a different armor type.

Armor Specialization [Fighter] 
Alternate Name: Armor Efficiency
Choose one type of armor, such as chain mail, for which you have already selected the Armor Focus feat. You are better at using that armor's natural advantages to protect yourself. 
Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected armor, Armor Focus with selected armor, fighter level 4th. 
Benefit:When wearing the selected armor, the armor bonus granted to your Armor Class is increased by +2. This bonus requires activity on your part, and thus the increase is lost whenever you are denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Because it is an increase in the armor bonus, it does not apply to incorporeal or touch attacks. You may also sleep in this armor without becoming fatigued or exhausted, regardless of its armor check penalty. This benefit applies both to standard armor and to armors made of special materials, such as mithral or adamantine. 
Special: You may take this feat multiple times; its effects do not stack. Each time you select it, this feat applies to a different armor type for which you have learned Armor Focus. 

Epic Armor Focus [Epic, Fighter] 
Choose any specific type of armor, such as chain mail or full plate armor, for which you have learned the Greater Armor Focus feat. You are the undisputed master at moving while wearing that armor. 
Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected armor, Armor Focus with selected armor, Greater Armor Focus with selected armor. 
Benefit: When wearing the selected armor type, you suffer no armor check penalties to any skill.
