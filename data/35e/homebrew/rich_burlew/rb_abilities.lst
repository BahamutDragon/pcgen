#The Druid - Replace the druid's existing wild shape, elemental wild shape, and thousand faces abilities with the following:
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Druid ~ Wild Shape.MOD		DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:At 5th level, the druid gains the ability to change its shape into that of an animal once per day. The druid may apply the Polymorphed template to himself, as long as the assumed shape is that of an Animal of Small or Medium size. The effect lasts for 1 hour/druid level, or until he chooses to change back. Changing form is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Use the druid's class level for all effects related to caster level, rather than total Hit Dice; any other class that grants wild shape abilities stack with druid levels to determine caster level. This ability otherwise functions exactly like the Animorph spell. The druid gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, a Huge animal at 15th level, and a Diminutive animal at 17th level. At 12th level, the druid can take the form of a Plant (such as a shambling mound) or a Vermin, with the same size restrictions as for Animals. At 19th level, the druid may take the form of an Animal or Vermin with the Swarm subtype. The druid gains additional uses of the wild shape ability at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Druid ~ Elemental Shape.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:At 16th level, the druid gains the ability to take the form of an elemental. Similar to wild shape, they may apply the Polymorphed template to himself, as long as the assumed shape is that of a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water). They may use this ability once per day, and the effects last 10 min./level or until he chooses to change back. This ability otherwise functions exactly like the wild shape ability. The druid gains additional uses of the elemental shape ability at 18th and 20th, and may take the form of Huge elementals at 20th level as well. 
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Druid ~ A Thousand Faces.MOD	DESC:.CLEAR	DESC:At 13th level, the druid may change his appearance at will as a standard action, as if casting the alter spell on himself. Unlike the spell, however, the druid may only use this ability while he does not possess the Polymorphed template.


###Block: Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Features
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies	KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiencies		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The bearer of the Ancestral Weapon gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.
Spellcasting				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Spellcasting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level and at every even-numbered level, the bearer of the Ancestral Weapon increases in spellcasting ability as if she had gained a level in a spellcasting class to which she had already belonged. She gains no other benefits of an increased level in that class, such as bonus metamagic feats. If she belonged to more than one spellcasting class, she must choose one at 1st level to which she must apply all spellcasting increases granted by this class.
Ancestral Weapon				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Ancestral Weapon					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 1st level, the bearer learns to use her heirloom weapon as a channel for the spirit of her dead ancestor, granting the object increasing magical power as the bearer advances and achieves deeper levels of meditation. The maximum power of the enchantment is equal to her class level, so that at 1st level, she can grant her weapon a +1 enhancement bonus, while at 10th level, she could enchant it with powers up to the cost equivalent of +10 (such as a +5 holy keen flaming burst longsword). The bearer must still fulfill any prerequisites for enchanting the weapon with a specific power, such as alignment or the casting of a specific spell, but she need spend no gold or XP to complete the crafting. The process takes the same amount of time as normal, however. The bearer of the Ancestral Weapon may repeatedly enchant her weapon as she advances in level, improving the weapon as one would add enhancements to an already magical weapon. Once the bearer has spent the required time meditating on the weapon, it is permanently magical, even if it leaves the bearer's hands. If the weapon used to fulfill the "Special" prerequisite for this class is already magical, the bearer may not further enhance the weapon's power until her class level exceeds its current total "plusses". The bearer may only have one Ancestral Weapon at a time; if it is destroyed, she must locate another heirloom that belonged to one or more of her ancestors and begin the process anew. If the new weapon belonged to a different ancestor, the DM is free to have a different spirit possess it, thus altering the lesser and greater powers gained via the spirit (below) to fit the new spirit.
Unity of Purpose				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Unity of Purpose					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The magic of the Ancestral Weapon is such that the weapon wants to remain whole and in its descendant's hand. Add the bearer's class level to opposed attack rolls to resist attempts to disarm the weapon from her. The weapon cannot be sundered while it is wielded by the bearer, though it can be damaged or even destroyed while unattended or in the hands of another.
Greater Unity				KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Greater Unity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By 7th level, whenever the weapon is separated from the bearer, she can sense its direction by concentrating for a full round. She cannot sense the weapon if it lies on another plane.
Spirit of the Ancestor			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Spirit of the Ancestor				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As the bearer learns to channel her ancestor, the previous owner's spirit comes to reside in the weapon itself. Starting at 2nd level, the Ancestral Wow becomes an intelligent magical item; the bearer does not need to spend any time, money, or XP for this metamorphosis to occur. The ancestor has difficulty manifesting its will at first, but as the bearer continues her meditations and follows the path of the weapon, the spirit gains in power. Eventually, the weapon takes on the full personality and memories of the ancestor. The bearer presumably attempts to contact an ancestor of similar tendencies as her own; the spirit's alignment is thus always within one step of that of the bearer herself. However, the ancestor may have its own ideas on how to solve problems, and might even attempt to take control of the bearer if their views differ sharply on an issue. The weapon's Ego score is equal to that of a weapon with the sum of its accumulated powers. The DM should fully detail the ancestor's history and personality as he or she would any NPC, and play them appropriately.

#The spirit of the ancestor gains the following powers:
Empathy			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Empathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, the weapon can communicate via empathy, pulsing or throbbing to indicate approval or dissent while the bearer wields it.
Speech			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Speech			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By 4th level, the spirit learns to speak aloud, learning one language per point of Intelligence bonus (and gaining an additional language whenever the spirit's Intelligence raises).
Telepathy			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Telepathy			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 8th level, the Ancestral Weapon has mastered telepathy, and can communicate with its bearer silently while within 30 feet. Either the bearer or the sword can initiate telepathic communication as a free action on their turn.
Score Increase		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Score Increase		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The spirit of the weapon begins at 2nd level with two mental ability scores of 12 and one of 10; the DM allocates these between Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as he sees fit. Whenever the bearer reaches a level where a score increase is indicated, the DM increases any two of these ability scores by +1, permanently.
Senses			KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Senses			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As the spirit becomes more adept at channeling itself through the heirloom, its ability to perceive the world increases. Its vision and hearing ranges increase, and it gains first darkvision, then blindsense, both of which continue to improve as well.
Skill Points		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Skill Points		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The weapon gains skill points equal its Intelligence bonus whenever the bearer raises her class level. The DM may spend these skill points on the following skills: Intimidate, Decipher Script, Knowledge (any), Search, Spot, Listen, Spellcraft, Sense Motive, Bluff, and Diplomacy. The weapon has maximum ranks equal to three more than the bearer's class level.
Lesser Power		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Lesser Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the spirit gains a lesser power, the DM chooses any one 1st or 2nd level spell; the Ancestral Weapon may now activate that spell as a spell-like ability, three times per day. The power should reflect the personality and nature of the ancestor inhabiting the weapon; the tables for random determination of an intelligent item's lesser powers may be used instead. The spirit uses its highest ability score to determine the saving throw DC, if necessary, and the caster level is equal to the bearer's class level.
Greater Power		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Greater Power		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Whenever the spirit gains a greater power, the DM chooses any one 3rd or 4th level spell; the Ancestral Weapon may now activate that spell as a spell-like ability, three times per day. Alternately, the DM may choose a 1st or 2nd level spell that can be used as a spell-like ability at will. The power should reflect the personality and nature of the ancestor inhabiting the weapon; the tables for random determination of an intelligent item's greater powers may be used instead. The spirit uses its highest ability score to determine the saving throw DC, if necessary, and the caster level is equal to the bearer's class level.
Weapon Crafter		KEY:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon ~ Weapon Crafter		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Bearer of the Ancestral Weapon Class Feature.SpecialQuality				SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th level, the bearer's experience enchanting her Ancestral Weapon grants her a greater understanding of all magical weapons. She may enchant all weapons of the same type as her Ancestral Weapon for 50%% of the normal cost in gold and XP, and all other weapons for 75%% of the normal cost. If her Ancestral Weapon is a projectile weapon, she may also enchant matching ammunition for 50%% cost. The time required for any such enchantments is not reduced from its original level. In addition, she may also craft magical weapons as if her caster level was equal to her total character level; she must still fulfill any spell prerequisites as normal.


# Champion
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies	KEY:Champion ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiencies		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The champion (and his avatar form) is proficient in all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
Avatar					KEY:Champion ~ Avatar						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Granted the imbued power of his patron, the Champion can transform himself from his normal shape into the shape of an avatar of holy might. Taking avatar form is a free action, but is always a spectacular affair; the champion appears to be struck by lightning, or engulfed in flames, or glow with otherworldly energy. The display is sufficient to immediately ruin any attempt to Hide, and grants a +10 circumstance bonus to the Spot checks of anyone who simply hasn't noticed the champion's presence. Transforming to or from avatar form requires a magic word to be spoken, so that a gag or a silence effect can prevent it from occurring. The avatar is a Medium-size native outsider with the Good subtype (even if the champion himself is a different size), and looks only slightly like the champion's normal form. It is always in the prime of life, even if the champion is younger or older, and is obviously virile and powerful. The avatar displays an obvious magical nature, the exact details of which depend on the deity or power that created the avatar; the champion may crackle with an aura of electricity, or have eyes of flame and skin of steel, or any other mystic appearance (subject to DM approval). The avatar is different enough from the champion's normal countenance that it counts as a disguise, even granting a +10 circumstance bonus to the Disguise skill check if someone might recognize him. As an outsider, the avatar has darkvision out to 60 feet. The avatar is almost like a separate character, with its own ability scores, hit points, feats, and skills. At 1st level, the avatar's ability scores are based on those of the champion, although the scores may be rearranged as desired for the avatar. Apply the ability score adjustments for the champion's race after arranging them. The avatar may then increase his ability scores 4 times, as if the avatar had gained a level divisible by four. Every champion class level gained thereafter, the avatar may increase one of his ability scores further; the standard increase to ability scores gained every four levels applies only to the champion's normal form.  The avatar also has gains skill points for every champion level (but not for levels in other classes) and has a different set of class skills than the champion's regular form. The avatar has one feat for every 3 character levels the champion has (regardless of the class). These may be feats he has in his normal form or they may be any feat he qualifies for by virtue of the avatar's ability scores; the avatar gains another feat whenever the champion reaches a character level divisible by three. The avatar has its own base attack bonus and base saving throws, based solely on the champion's class level (that is, attack and save bonuses from other classes or monster Hit Dice do not add to the avatar's values). The avatar cannot access any class abilities from any class other than champion, such as spellcasting, fighter bonus feats, smite evil, turn undead, or wild shape. The avatar loses all racial traits as well, with the sole exception of racial adjustments to ability scores. Familiars, animal companions, and paladin mounts continue to serve the avatar as they would the champion, as do cohorts and followers gained from the Leadership feat. The champion cannot use any of his normal feats or skills when in avatar form (except for the bonus feat gained at 2nd level; see below). All equipment carried by the champion changes appearance slightly to match the avatar's overall image (and new size, if the avatar form is larger or smaller), but is otherwise unaffected. The avatar has 12-sided Hit Dice equal to the champion's class levels and its own pool of hit points, modified by the avatar form's Constitution. Damage the champion takes when in avatar form comes from this set of hit points, rather than the champion's own hit points. Likewise, damage suffered while in normal form does not affect the avatar's health. The hit point total for each form "freezes" when the champion switches forms, so that if the avatar is wounded, it will still be wounded the next time the champion calls on it. If the avatar is reduced to negative hit points, the champion immediately reverts to normal form (complete with whatever hit point total he had before changing.) If the avatar is outright killed, the champion loses the ability to take avatar form (see below). The champion and his avatar must each be healed separately, but the champion can choose to mentally direct any healing spell or effect to which he is subject to heal his avatar rather than his normal self. If either form is subject to a healing effect that would heal more hit points than that form has suffered in damage, the leftover healing may be transferred to the other form. The avatar is immune to ability drain, ability damage, disease, energy drain, poison, or polymorph; any of these effects that have taken hold on the champion are suppressed while in avatar form. Any other spell or ability affecting the champion also affects the avatar when it is taken. The avatar is affected by spells that specifically target or affect native outsiders, and is immune to spells that target humanoids only. An anti-magic field suppresses the avatar form as long as the champion remains within, but the avatar form returns if the champion leaves the area. The champion may take avatar form once per day at 1st level, and may maintain it for 3 minutes + 1 minute per point of the champion's Charisma bonus (not that of the avatar). At the end of this period, he reverts back to his normal shape, and is fatigued for an amount of time equal to the length of time he held avatar form. The champion can also return to normal form voluntarily, which will naturally shorten the duration of his exhaustion. 
Spells					KEY:Champion ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As the champion continues to serve as the vessel for his deity's will, he gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells drawn from the champion spell list. A champion must choose and prepare his spells in advance, and may not cast them while in avatar form. To prepare or cast a spell, the champion must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The DC for a saving throw against a champion's spell is 10 + the spell level + the champion's Wisdom modifier. A champion can only cast a limited number of spells, as indicated on the accompanying table. The champion also gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When the table indicates that the champion gets 0 spells of a particular spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to for high Wisdom. A champion prepares and casts spells as a paladin does, and his caster level is equal to half his champion class level.
Bonus Feat					KEY:Champion ~ Bonus Feat					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 2nd level, the champion learns a single bonus feat that he may use in both of his two forms. The feat must come from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Animal Affinity, Armor Proficiency (Heavy), Athletic, Deceitful, Deft Hands, Diligent, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Investigator, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Magical Aptitude, Negotiator, Nimble Fingers, Persuasive, Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus, Stealthy, or Toughness.
Domain					KEY:Champion ~ Domain						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As the servant of a deity, the champion gains access to one of his god's domains at 4th level. He may add the domain spells to the champion spell list, though he does not gain an additional domain slot per day in which to prepare them. He also gains the domain's granted power, which he may use in either his normal form or his avatar form. If the domain power is based on any ability score, such as the uses per day being based on Charisma, use the champion's relevant ability score, not the avatar's. At 12th level, the champion may select a second domain.
Energy Resistance				KEY:Champion ~ Energy Resistance				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:As the champion becomes more powerful, his avatar becomes resistant to various forms of energy. At 3rd level, the champion chooses one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic); his avatar gains resistance 5 to that energy type. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the champion may choose another energy type to gain resistance 5 against OR increase his existing resistance to one energy type by 5. Alternately, if the avatar already possesses resistance 20 for any energy type, he may exchange it for complete immunity from that energy rather than raising it to resistance 25.
Fly						KEY:Champion ~ Fly						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 6th level and above, the avatar can fly with perfect maneuverability. His fly speed starts out at 30 feet per round, and increases at 12th and 18th levels.
Damage Reduction				KEY:Champion ~ Damage Reduction				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 9th level, the champion's avatar form gains damage reduction 5/evil or silver (if lawful good) or cold iron (if chaotic good). If neutral good, the DM chooses which type of metal overcomes the avatar form's damage reduction. At 17th level, this increases to damage reduction 10/evil or silver/cold iron.
Perfect Transformation			KEY:Champion ~ Perfect Transformation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 20th level, the unity between the champion and the avatar has been perfected. The avatar increases his resistance to all five types of energy by 5; if any resistance would become 25, the avatar instead gains immunity to that energy type. From this point on, whenever the champion assumes avatar form, the avatar always begins fully healed, even if damaged in a previous manifestation.
Restrictions				KEY:Champion ~ Restrictions					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Champion Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The champion must maintain a good alignment at all times. If his alignment strays to neutral, he finds that taking avatar form becomes very difficult. He must make a Charisma check (DC equals 10 + champion level) in order to transform to the avatar, with failure expending one of his daily transformations to no effect. The champion must atone for his transgressions (often through a quest given to him by the avatar itself) and regain a good alignment or else it will eventually abandon him-as it will a champion who becomes evil. If the avatar is killed, the champion cannot take avatar form until it is returned to life. The champion must be the recipient of a raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell, which will return the avatar to life, although neither the avatar nor the champion loses a level as a result. The death and raising of the champion, however, will result in such a loss as normal.
