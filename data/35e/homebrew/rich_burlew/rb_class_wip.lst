Halfling Rock-Skipping Champion

Requirements:
To qualify to become a rock-skipping champion, a character must fulfill all the following criteria. 
Base Attack Bonus: +6 
Race: Halfling 
Feats: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus (Sling/Halfling Throwing Stone). 
Special: Must have won at least three public rock-throwing tournaments, each with at least 10 participants. 

Class Skills:
The rock-skipping champion's class skills (and the key ability score for each) are Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), and Spot (Wis). 
Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.
Hit Dice: d8


Class Features:
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The rock-skipping champion gains proficiency with all simple weapons, as well as light armor.
Skipping: The champion learns to make a thrown or slung stone bounce from one target to strike another. As a standard action, he throws or slings a stone (but not a bullet) at a target. If he successfully strikes that target (be it a creature, a wall, whatever), he can gain one or more "skips" to strike other foes. The rock bounces and changes direction, at the thrower's control, and then continues on towards a secondary target. This is a skip, and a 1st level rock-skipping champion can only make a single skip with each standard action. As they rise in level, they learn to throw with sufficient skill to allow the stone to skip multiple times with a single standard action. The champion can cause the skipping stone to strike another target or to perform a different trick, and he gains more tricks to choose from as he rises in level. You must declare all targets and/or tricks for a single throw before rolling the dice; you may not, for example, wait to see how the first attack goes before choosing the target of the skip. If a skipping stone misses its target at any time, it clatters to the ground in that space and does not skip on to further targets.

In addition to gaining more skips per throw, the champion learns how to make his stone travel further between skips. The skipping distance listed for each level indicates the maximum distance a rock may travel after a skip. A skipping stone is still limited by its total range, and all attacks with a skipping stone suffer appropriate range penalties based on how far the rock has flown up to that point.

In order to make a stone skip, the champion cannot rush his throws. He may not use the Rapid Shot feat, throw with more than one hand, or throw multiple stones in the same round for any reason in order for to gain the benefits of skipping. Sneak attack or other precision-based damage may only apply to the first target of a throw, before any skips, and the target must still be within 30 feet as normal. A rock-skipping champion may always choose to not make a stone skip when he launches it.

Skipping Strike: The first trick learned by all champions is to use a skipping stone to strike another nearby foe. After a thrown or slung stone successfully strikes any foe, the champion may cause it to skip to any foe within skipping distance (see above). Each attack a single stone makes after the first suffers a cumulative -3 penalty, so that a stone that makes two skips to strike two additional enemies after the first will suffer a -3 circumstance penalty to the second attack and a -6 circumstance penalty to the third.

Skip Tricks: At 2nd level and every level thereafter, the champion may select one of the following tricks. Some are used after a stone has struck a target, while others affect the whole throw.
Returning: After a skip, instead of striking another target, the rock returns to the champion's hand. The champion must be within his maximum skip distance from the target struck. This trick is always the last performed in a skip sequence; even if the champion is entitled to additional skips, using a returning skip ends that stone's flight.
Ba-Bump: Upon striking a target, instead of ricocheting to another, the rock flies straight up for 5 feet, then falls back down, striking the same target again. After the second strike, the rock can continue on to another target if it has more skips available. No stone may attack the same target more than twice in a row using this trick. A ba-bump trick uses up 10 feet of the rock's flight path.
Bank Shot: The halfling learns to bounce rocks off walls, trees, ceilings, etc., in order to make a difficult shot. While the halfling must make a ranged touch attack roll to hit the wall, most walls have a touch AC of 1 (trees and such might be higher). If successful, the rock can bounce up to 180 degrees and continue on its way. This trick is used to attack opponents hiding behind cover (in which case it ignores that cover) or with which the halfling does not have line of sight (in which case regular miss chances for concealment still apply). Note that this trick still counts as a skip, so attacks made after a bank shot still suffer the -3 penalty for being a secondary attack.
Ping Pong: This trick is only available if the Champion can make 2 or more skips in a single throw. Whenever a foe is struck twice with the same thrown rock (but at least one other target was successfully hit between the first and the second attack), the second attack gains a +2 bonus to damage. For example, two fighters stand 10 feet apart. A 5th level champion slings a rock at one and hits him, then uses his first skip to bounce to the second fighter at a -3 to hit. He hits that fighter, then has the rock bounce back to the first fighter, now with a -6 to hit but +2 to damage due to the Ping Pong. The halfling then uses his third skip to send it back to the second fighter, now at -9 to hit and +2 to damage.
Between the Eyes: With this trick, the Critical Threat range of the first attack of any rock throw is treated as one greater (19-20, instead of just 20). Note that this attack must be the one made before any skips, so that in a bank shot situation, this ability is "wasted" on the wall, not the first creature hit. This increase stacks with Improved Critical and Weapon of Impact.
Soft Skip: The champion may make any or all attacks with a skipping rock inflict nonlethal damage. He does not suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls for doing so, and may freely mix nonlethal and regular attacks within the same throw. You must declare which attacks are to be nonlethal before throwing.
Lucky Bounce: Once per round, when a rock misses its target but still has one or more skips remaining, the champion can choose to declare it a "lucky bounce." While the attack is still considered a miss, the rock skips to the next designated target as if it were a hit.

Sports Star: Halfling rock-skipping champions are the elite sports superstars of their culture, and attract attention wherever they go. A champion gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all Diplomacy skill checks with fellow halflings if he is recognized as a rock-skipping champion (or +4 if the Halfling is of the opposite gender). A demonstration of rock-skipping prowess is often enough to grant this bonus, even if the halflings do not recognize the champion by name or face.



The Divine Trickster

Requirements:
Alignment: Any nonlawful. 
Skills: Bluff 9 ranks, Hide 9 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Disable Device 4 ranks. 
Spells: Ability to cast 2nd level divine spells from the Chaos, Luck, or Trickery domains. 
Special: Sneak Attack +2d6 class ability, Turn Undead class ability. 

Class Skills:
The divine trickster's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Cha), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Search (Int), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Speak Languages (Int), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Rope (Dex). 
Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Intelligence modifier. 
Hit Dice: d6 

Class Features:
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: The divine trickster gains no additional armor or weapon proficiencies.

Spells per Day: When a new divine trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (such as increased ability to turn undead or take wild shape, or domain powers that are based on cleric level), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a divine trickster, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Surprise for the Dead (Su): The divine trickster learns to channel positive energy into a nasty surprise for undead who let their guard down. As a free action, the divine trickster may expend one daily use of her Turn Undead ability in order to gain the ability to make sneak attacks or critical hits against undead creatures. This effect last for 1 round per point of Charisma bonus the divine trickster has (minimum 1 round), and applies to all attacks made within that time. The trickster must still meet all conditions for a successful sneaks attack; that is, the undead must still be flat-footed, flanked, or otherwise eligible for a sneak attack, and must be within 30 feet of the trickster if the attack is ranged. In addition, the divine trickster may only make sneak attacks or critical hits against incorporeal undead creature if she is wielding a ghost touch weapon or is herself incorporeal.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If a divine trickster gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

Trap Guidance (Su): The divine trickster gains special intuition into magical traps; at 3rd level, she may add her Wisdom bonus to all Search, Spellcraft, and Disable Device skill checks to find, identify, or remove magical traps.

Domain Flexibility (Su): Select one of the following domains to which the character has access: Chaos, Luck, or Trickery. The trickster may spontaneously convert any prepared cleric spell (except a domain spell) into a domain spell of the same level or lower in the selected domain, just as a cleric channels energy to convert spells into cure spells. 

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): The divine force the trickster serves subtly distracts nearby creatures from looking in her direction. Starting at 7th level, the divine trickster can use the Hide skill even when being observed.

Slippery Mind (Su): This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name, except that it is a supernatural rather than extraordinary ability.

Restrictions: The divine trickster is obligated to uphold whatever beliefs or mandates are given by the force that provides her divine spellcasting power; failure to do so will cause her to lose her supernatural abilities as she would her ability to cast spells.


Epic Advancement:
Hit Dice: d6 
Skill Points: 4 + Int modifier 
Spellcasting: At every additional level after 10th, the divine trickster advances in spellcasting power, as described above. 
Sneak Attack: At every additional even-numbered level after 10th, the divine trickster's sneak attack damage increases by +1d6. 
Bonus Feats: At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the divine trickster gains a bonus epic feat, selected from the list of epic divine trickster feats.
Epic Divine Trickster Bonus Feat List: Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Blinding Speed, Bonus Domain, Dexterous Fortitude, Dexterous Will, Epic Reflexes, Epic Reputation, Epic Speed, Epic Will, Improved Alignment-Based Casting (Chaos only), Improved Sneak Attack, Improved Spell Capacity, Positive Energy Aura, Spectral Strike, Spell Opportunity, Spell Stowaway, Spontaneous Domain Access, Trap Sense.



The Elemental Infiltrator

Requirements:
Alignment: Any neutral. 
Base Attack Bonus: +4 
Skills: Each element requires that different skills be mastered:
Air: Balance 4 ranks, Escape Artist 8 ranks, Tumble 8 ranks, Speak Language (Auran).
Earth: Appraise 8 ranks, Disable Device 8 ranks, Open Locks 4 ranks, Speak Language (Terran).
Fire: Bluff 8 ranks, Sleight of Hand 8 ranks, Use Magic Device 4 ranks, Speak Language (Ignan).
Water: Disguise 8 ranks, Bluff 8 ranks, Swim 4 ranks, Speak Language (Aquan).
Feats: Each element requires that different feats be mastered:
Air: Combat Reflexes, Dodge
Earth: Great Fortitude, Power Attack
Fire: Combat Expertise, Improved Feint
Water: Improved Initiative, Iron Will
Special: Sneak Attack +1d6. 
Special: Must either be an native outsider with the appropriate elemental subtype OR have 4 ranks in Knowledge (the planes). 
Special: Must make peaceful friendly contact with an elemental from the appropriate plane.

Class Skills:
The elemental infiltrator's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), and Use Rope (Dex). 
In addition, each of the four elements has additional skills that are class skills only for them:
Air: Escape Artist (Dex), Tumble (Dex)
Earth: Disable Device (Int), Open Locks (Dex)
Fire: Intimidate (Cha), Use Magic Device (Cha)
Water: Disguise (Cha), Forgery (Int), Swim (Str)
Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Intelligence modifier.
Hit Dice: d6 

Class Features:
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: The elemental infiltrator gains no additional weapon proficiencies. Earth infiltrators gain medium armor proficiency and shield proficiency, if they do not already possess them.

Elemental Transition I (Ex): When the rogue first embarks on the path of the elemental infiltrator, they start to slowly take on traits associated with their extraplanar allies. At 1st level, the elemental infiltrator no longer needs to sleep; they need only meditate on the mysteries of their element for 4 hours to refresh themselves (this is similar to an elf's trance)and they become immune to sleep effects. Their physiology takes on other characteristics of an elemental as well; whenever a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against the infiltrator, there is a 25%% chance that it is negated due to his partial elemental transformation. Roll damage normally instead. At this stage of transformation, the elemental infiltrator has no outward signs of his allegiance.

Find Flaw (Ex): Careful study of the elements allows the infiltrator to find harmonic weaknesses in the pure elemental bodies of creatures from those planes. An elemental infiltrator can make sneak attacks or critical hits against creatures of the elemental type. This ability also bypasses the chance to ignore a critical hit or sneak attack when attacking another elemental infiltrator.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th, but not 10th). If an elemental infiltrator gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

Elemental Transition II (Ex): The infiltrator's body continues to shift towards an elemental state, granting him immunity to paralysis and a +4 bonus to saving throws vs. poison. His appearance starts shifting towards that of an elemental, perhaps changing his coloration or skin texture; this grants him a +2 bonus to Charisma-based skills when dealing with elementals or outsiders with an elemental subtype. Most importantly, he gains the ability to move through the element he has chosen with ease:
Air: Gains the ability to fly at a rate equal to his base speed (good maneuverability).
Earth: Gains the ability to burrow at a rate equal to his base speed. Earth infiltrators may burrow through dirt, but not stone or similar hard substances. He does not leave a tunnel behind.
Fire: Any racial fire resistance the infiltrator has increases by 10. If the infiltrator does not have racial fire resistance, he gains fire resistance 10.
Water: Gains the ability to swim at a rate equal to twice his base. The infiltrator gains the benefits of having a racial swim speed (+8 to Swim checks, may always take 10, may use the run action while swimming.) The water infiltrator can also hold his breath for 4 times as long before making a Constitution check, and need only make such a check every 4 rounds thereafter.

Elemental Transition III (Ex and Sp): Now clearly resembling an elemental humanoid of some sort, the infiltrator becomes immune to stunning and gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. He also gains the ability to manipulate his element to hide himself from others. He gains one of the following as a spell-like ability, usable three times per day:
Air: fog cloud
Earth: stone shape
Fire: pyrotechnics (Saving throw is Charisma-based.)
Water: alter self

Elemental Transition IV (Ex): The elemental infiltrator becomes immune to poison. The chance to negate a sneak attack or critical hit increases to 50%% as most of their body has transmuted to their chosen element.

Elemental Escape (Sp): When in a desperate situation, an infiltrator learns to use the plane to which he has pledged himself as a handy escape route. An elemental infiltrator learns to plane shift themselves to their elemental plane once per day at 9th level. They cannot take any other creatures with them except bonded animals (animal companions, familiars, etc.) They may also plane shift from the elemental plane to their native plane once per day. The lack of accuracy with this method of travel makes it useless as a form of teleportation, though, as the infiltrator may well end up 500 miles from his intended destination.

Elemental Perfection (Ex): After long studies, the infiltrator finally transforms permanently into an elemental. His type becomes "elemental" and he gains the appropriate elemental subtype (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water), as well as the "Augmented" subtype with regards to his previous creature type. This grants him full immunity to flanking, starvation, suffocation, and critical hits, plus the immunities gained in earlier forms of elemental transition. He does not need to meditate or rest at all, and cannot be fatigued or exhausted, though if he is an arcane spellcaster he must still rest for 8 hours before regaining spells. He gains the following additional abilities as an elemental of his size:
Air: Air mastery, fly 100 ft. (perfect), slam attack, whirlwind attack.
Earth: Earth glide, earth mastery, push, slam attack.
Fire: Burn, immune to fire, slam attack, vulnerability to cold.
Water: Drench, slam attack, vortex, water mastery.
The elemental infiltrator is now indistinguishable from a native to their chosen elemental plane, though they are still also recognizable as themselves. They gain a +4 bonus to Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with natives of their plane, but now suffer a -4 penalty to those same skills when dealing with elementals from the opposed plane.

Unlike other elementals, an elemental infiltrator can still be brought back from the dead as if he were still a member of his previous creature type.


Epic Advancement:
Hit Dice: d6 
Skill Points: 6 + Int modifier 
Sneak Attack: At every additional even-numbered level after 10th, the elemental infiltrator's sneak attack damage increases by +1d6. 
Damage Reduction: At 13th level, the epic elemental infiltrator gains damage reduction 5/--; this increases by 1 every 3 levels thereafter (6/-- at 16th level, 7/-- at 19th level, etc.)
Bonus Feats: At 14th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the elemental infiltrator gains a bonus epic feat, selected from the list of epic elemental infiltrator feats.
Epic Elemental Infiltrator Bonus Feat List: Armor Skin, Blinding Speed, Damage Reduction, Energy Resistance, Epic Reflexes, Epic Speed, Epic Toughness, Great Dexterity, Great Intelligence, Improved Darkvision, Improved Sneak Attack, Superior Initiative.



The Champion
Champions have the following game statistics.

Abilities: Charisma is important to the champion's ability to hold avatar form as long as possible, as well as to allay suspicion if the champion wishes to keep his identity secret. Wisdom is useful for the small amount of divine spells that champion learns to cast. Strength and Constitution are most important for the champion's avatar form, which is likely to be interested primarily in combat.
Alignment: Any good.
Starting Gold: 6d4 x 10 (150 gp)
Hit Dice: d8

Class Skills
The champion's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), and Swim (Str).
Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modifier) x4
Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifier

The champion's avatar form has a separate list of class skills. The avatar form's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Swim (Str).
Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x4
Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier

Class Features
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: The champion (and his avatar form) is proficient in all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).
Avatar (Su): Granted the imbued power of his patron, the Champion can transform himself from his normal shape into the shape of an avatar of holy might. Taking avatar form is a free action, but is always a spectacular affair; the champion appears to be struck by lightning, or engulfed in flames, or glow with otherworldly energy. The display is sufficient to immediately ruin any attempt to Hide, and grants a +10 circumstance bonus to the Spot checks of anyone who simply hasn't noticed the champion's presence. Transforming to or from avatar form requires a magic word to be spoken, so that a gag or a silence effect can prevent it from occurring. The avatar is a Medium-size native outsider with the Good subtype (even if the champion himself is a different size), and looks only slightly like the champion's normal form. It is always in the prime of life, even if the champion is younger or older, and is obviously virile and powerful. The avatar displays an obvious magical nature, the exact details of which depend on the deity or power that created the avatar; the champion may crackle with an aura of electricity, or have eyes of flame and skin of steel, or any other mystic appearance (subject to DM approval). The avatar is different enough from the champion's normal countenance that it counts as a disguise, even granting a +10 circumstance bonus to the Disguise skill check if someone might recognize him. As an outsider, the avatar has darkvision out to 60 feet. The avatar is almost like a separate character, with its own ability scores, hit points, feats, and skills. At 1st level, the avatar's ability scores are based on those of the champion, although the scores may be rearranged as desired for the avatar. Apply the ability score adjustments for the champion's race after arranging them. The avatar may then increase his ability scores 4 times, as if the avatar had gained a level divisible by four. Every champion class level gained thereafter, the avatar may increase one of his ability scores further; the standard increase to ability scores gained every four levels applies only to the champion's normal form.  The avatar also has gains skill points for every champion level (but not for levels in other classes) and has a different set of class skills than the champion's regular form. The avatar has one feat for every 3 character levels the champion has (regardless of the class). These may be feats he has in his normal form or they may be any feat he qualifies for by virtue of the avatar's ability scores; the avatar gains another feat whenever the champion reaches a character level divisible by three. The avatar has its own base attack bonus and base saving throws, based solely on the champion's class level (that is, attack and save bonuses from other classes or monster Hit Dice do not add to the avatar's values). The avatar cannot access any class abilities from any class other than champion, such as spellcasting, fighter bonus feats, smite evil, turn undead, or wild shape. The avatar loses all racial traits as well, with the sole exception of racial adjustments to ability scores. Familiars, animal companions, and paladin mounts continue to serve the avatar as they would the champion, as do cohorts and followers gained from the Leadership feat. The champion cannot use any of his normal feats or skills when in avatar form (except for the bonus feat gained at 2nd level; see below). All equipment carried by the champion changes appearance slightly to match the avatar's overall image (and new size, if the avatar form is larger or smaller), but is otherwise unaffected. The avatar has 12-sided Hit Dice equal to the champion's class levels and its own pool of hit points, modified by the avatar form's Constitution. Damage the champion takes when in avatar form comes from this set of hit points, rather than the champion's own hit points. Likewise, damage suffered while in normal form does not affect the avatar's health. The hit point total for each form "freezes" when the champion switches forms, so that if the avatar is wounded, it will still be wounded the next time the champion calls on it. If the avatar is reduced to negative hit points, the champion immediately reverts to normal form (complete with whatever hit point total he had before changing.) If the avatar is outright killed, the champion loses the ability to take avatar form (see below). The champion and his avatar must each be healed separately, but the champion can choose to mentally direct any healing spell or effect to which he is subject to heal his avatar rather than his normal self. If either form is subject to a healing effect that would heal more hit points than that form has suffered in damage, the leftover healing may be transferred to the other form. The avatar is immune to ability drain, ability damage, disease, energy drain, poison, or polymorph; any of these effects that have taken hold on the champion are suppressed while in avatar form. Any other spell or ability affecting the champion also affects the avatar when it is taken. The avatar is affected by spells that specifically target or affect native outsiders, and is immune to spells that target humanoids only. An anti-magic field suppresses the avatar form as long as the champion remains within, but the avatar form returns if the champion leaves the area. The champion may take avatar form once per day at 1st level, and may maintain it for 3 minutes + 1 minute per point of the champion's Charisma bonus (not that of the avatar). At the end of this period, he reverts back to his normal shape, and is fatigued for an amount of time equal to the length of time he held avatar form. The champion can also return to normal form voluntarily, which will naturally shorten the duration of his exhaustion. 
Spells: As the champion continues to serve as the vessel for his deity's will, he gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells drawn from the champion spell list. A champion must choose and prepare his spells in advance, and may not cast them while in avatar form. To prepare or cast a spell, the champion must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The DC for a saving throw against a champion's spell is 10 + the spell level + the champion's Wisdom modifier. A champion can only cast a limited number of spells, as indicated on the accompanying table. The champion also gains bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When the table indicates that the champion gets 0 spells of a particular spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to for high Wisdom. A champion prepares and casts spells as a paladin does, and his caster level is equal to half his champion class level.
Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, the champion learns a single bonus feat that he may use in both of his two forms. The feat must come from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Animal Affinity, Armor Proficiency (Heavy), Athletic, Deceitful, Deft Hands, Diligent, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Investigator, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Magical Aptitude, Negotiator, Nimble Fingers, Persuasive, Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus, Stealthy, or Toughness.
Domain: As the servant of a deity, the champion gains access to one of his god's domains at 4th level. He may add the domain spells to the champion spell list, though he does not gain an additional domain slot per day in which to prepare them. He also gains the domain's granted power, which he may use in either his normal form or his avatar form. If the domain power is based on any ability score, such as the uses per day being based on Charisma, use the champion's relevant ability score, not the avatar's. At 12th level, the champion may select a second domain.
Energy Resistance (Su): As the champion becomes more powerful, his avatar becomes resistant to various forms of energy. At 3rd level, the champion chooses one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic); his avatar gains resistance 5 to that energy type. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th), the champion may choose another energy type to gain resistance 5 against OR increase his existing resistance to one energy type by 5. Alternately, if the avatar already possesses resistance 20 for any energy type, he may exchange it for complete immunity from that energy rather than raising it to resistance 25.
Fly (Su): At 6th level and above, the avatar can fly with perfect maneuverability. His fly speed starts out at 30 feet per round, and increases at 12th and 18th levels.
Damage Reduction (Su): Starting at 9th level, the champion's avatar form gains damage reduction 5/evil or silver (if lawful good) or cold iron (if chaotic good). If neutral good, the DM chooses which type of metal overcomes the avatar form's damage reduction. At 17th level, this increases to damage reduction 10/evil or silver/cold iron.
Perfect Transformation: At 20th level, the unity between the champion and the avatar has been perfected. The avatar increases his resistance to all five types of energy by 5; if any resistance would become 25, the avatar instead gains immunity to that energy type. From this point on, whenever the champion assumes avatar form, the avatar always begins fully healed, even if damaged in a previous manifestation.
Restrictions: The champion must maintain a good alignment at all times. If his alignment strays to neutral, he finds that taking avatar form becomes very difficult. He must make a Charisma check (DC equals 10 + champion level) in order to transform to the avatar, with failure expending one of his daily transformations to no effect. The champion must atone for his transgressions (often through a quest given to him by the avatar itself) and regain a good alignment or else it will eventually abandon him-as it will a champion who becomes evil. If the avatar is killed, the champion cannot take avatar form until it is returned to life. The champion must be the recipient of a raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell, which will return the avatar to life, although neither the avatar nor the champion loses a level as a result. The death and raising of the champion, however, will result in such a loss as normal.

Champion Spell List:
1st-Level: bless, bless weapon, cure light wounds, detect evil, divine favor, endure elements, magic weapon, protection from evil, remove fear, shield of faith
2nd-Level: bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, cure moderate wounds, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, owl's wisdom, resist energy, shield other
3rd-Level: cure serious wounds, fly, heroism, magic circle against evil, prayer, protection from energy
4th-Level: cure critical wounds, death ward, dispel evil, divine power, freedom of movement, holy sword


#Now, the champion's limited access to his powers makes him a far less appealing choice, especially in a high-level game where other classes will have already earned their bells and whistles. To remedy this, add the following to the champion's abilities:
Energy Resistance (Su): As listed above, but the avatar's energy resistance also makes the champion more resilient. The champion gains energy resistance 5 to any energy form that the avatar has 10 or more points of resistance.
Damage Reduction (Su): As above, but the avatar's invulnerability makes the champion harder to kill. The champion gains damage reduction 1/evil or silver (if lawful good) or cold iron (if chaotic good) at 9th level, which increases to 5/evil or silver/cold iron at 17th level. At 17th level, the avatar's damage reduction also increases to 10/evil AND silver/cold iron. The champion also suffers from the potential need for multiple sets of equipment. If you want to have your avatar form be a bruiser and your champion stand in the back and shoot arrows, you need to invest in different two magic weapons. Luckily, there are two gaps in the champion's class ability list, so I can remedy that one right now:
Avatar Weapon (Su): Starting at 8th level, the champion can cause one of his magical weapons to change shape along with him when he takes his avatar form. The weapon changes to any one other simple or martial weapon, but keeps all enchantments and is crafted from the same special materials (if possible). The champion chooses a weapon to be his avatar weapon by meditating on it for 8 hours and deciding what its alternate form will be; once chosen, the weapon can only transform to that single shape. The champion can meditate again to switch the ability to a different weapon or to change the alternate form to that of a different weapon.
Greater Avatar Weapon (Su): At 16th level, the avatar learns to channel a portion of his power into his avatar weapon. When in avatar form, his current avatar weapon gains additional magical abilities equal to a +3 enchantment. This ability can either be a single +3 ability (e.g. a weapon of speed), a +2 and a +1 ability (a holy keen weapon), or three +1 abilities (a shocking flaming frost weapon), as the champion prefers. These abilities can increase the weapon's total number of enchantments above the normal limits of how many special abilities can be present on a weapon. You may not choose an enhancement bonus as a special ability. The champion chooses what abilities are gained using the same meditation process for switching his avatar weapon; the abilities gained remain the same until they are switched.
