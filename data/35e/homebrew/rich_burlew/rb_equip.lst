#Throwing Stones
#A halfling throwing stone is essentially just a smooth stone that flies evenly through the air. They are rarely used in battle, except by true experts, but are used during games and tournaments of all kinds. They can be used equally well by halfling- and human-sized wielders.

Halfling Throwing Stone	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Halfling Throwing Stone	TYPE:Weapon.Exotic.Ranged.Bludgeoning	COST:0.1	WT:0.2	CRITMULT:x2			DAMAGE:1d3	RANGE:15	SPROP:When used with a sling, halfling throwing stones do not suffer any penalty to hit (as a normal stone does). This prestige class considers the sling and a halfling throwing stone to be the same weapon for purposes of feats such as Weapon Focus. If you use the Rock-Skipping Champion prestige class in your campaign, you should give halflings Weapon Familiarity: Halfling Throwing Stone (making them simple weapons for all Halflings).
