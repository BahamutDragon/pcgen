The Glaive				PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|The Glaive	TYPE:Weapon.Ranged.Thrown.Artifact			WT:5		CRITMULT:x2			CRITRANGE:1			DAMAGE:5d6	EQMOD:PLUS5W	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	SPROP:Returning: The Glaive can be thrown with a 10 foot range increment and returns through the air back to the creature that threw it. It returns on the round following the round that it was thrown just before its throwing creature's turn. It is therefore ready to use again that turn. - Dancing: Instead of returning to the wielder, the Glaive can be mentally directed to attack in midair with a hand gesture. This requires the thrower's concentration, and he can do nothing but direct the Glaive. Mentally directed attacks can happen as often as twice a round. - Dispelling: If the wielder of the Glaive wins initiative against a spellcaster, the Glaive can interrupt any spell that has a physical presence ( fireballs, lightning bolts, magic missile, color sprays, etc.) as per dispel magic (usable every round as a standard action) at the class level of the wielder. (Only the counterspell is possible, not the targeted dispel or area dispel versions of dispel magic.) - Sharpness: On a very high hit roll, the Glaive will sever an extremity -- arm, leg, tail, tentacle, whatever (but not head) -- determined by random dice roll, taking into account the Glaive's +5 bonus:

Sands of Life														COST:306000	WT:3															SOURCEPAGE:p.9	SPROP:This sand acts as protection against all temporal beings from the Demiplane of Time. When contained within an hourglass, the owner must ensure that the sand is always flowing to keep Time denizens from reaching him or her. It creates an invisible 10 -ft. radius barrier, centered on the hourglass. Forcing the barrier against creatures whom the artifact keeps at bay strains and collapses the field. If the sand is removed from the hourglass, it flows out of the user's hands and with it, his life. The user loses 1 hit point per minute until he dies. This process is irreversible.

Shortspear.COPY=Slayer Spear
Slayer Spear.MOD														COST:3052	WT:5												EQMOD:PLUS1W	SOURCEPAGE:p.9	SPROP:These +1 shortspears fire magic missiles that inflict 1d4+1 points of damage. An attack roll is required. Each missile costs one charge. A maximum of two may be expended in one round. Each spear contains 80 charges.
