#+2 Con, -2 Wis, +2 Cha: Incandents are naturally robust, but often jump to conclusions and can be prone to suggestion. However, they have a natural ebullience that often wins over allies.
#Medium: As Medium creatures, incandents have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
#Automatic Languages: Common, Celestial. Bonus Languages: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran.
#Outsider Traits: The incandent is an Outsider (Native).
#Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass incandent's fighter class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty. Physical activity comes naturally to an incandent, and most revel in combat.
#Level Adjustment: +0. Though robust and hearty, the incandent's vulnerability to darkness is a distinct weakness.

#Automatic Languages: Common, Infernal. Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran.
#Outsider Traits: The voidling is an Outsider (Native).
#Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass voidling's rogue class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty. Voidlings keep naturally to the shadows.
#Level Adjustment: +0. Despite some potent abilities, the voidling is no tougher than a typical character race in the PH.
