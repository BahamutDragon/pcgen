#Wondrous Items


Ring Bracelet (Ring)	MODS:YES	TYPE:Ring	SLOTS:1

Ring Bracelet (Bracer)	MODS:YES	TYPE:Bracer	SLOTS:1

# This item of jewelry (sometimes called a handflower or a ring bracer) clasps around the wearer's wrist, with thin chains extending up to wrap around one or more fingers as well.
#    When used as a magic item, the ring bracelet occupies one ring space, one glove space, and one bracer space. Thus, it can't be worn with a full set of bracers or with a full set of gloves. However, two ring bracelets can be worn (each on a separate hand) and each will function normally.
#    Because it takes up multiple item locations on a character, a magic ring bracelet costs only half as much as a normal wondrous item with the same power or powers. If created as a matching pair, the item costs only one-third the normal price.
#    Crafting a magic ring bracelet requires both the Craft Wondrous Item and Forge Ring feats.

#    Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, Forge Ring, shield of faith, spell immunity, caster must be of a level three times that of the bonus of the ring bracers; Market Price: 6,000 gp (+1), 10,000 gp (+2), 15,000 gp (+3), 21,000 gp (+4), 28,000 gp (+5).

Figment Weavers	TYPE:Magic.Ring	SPROP:This shimmering pair of ring bracelets appears to be composed of iridescent webs strung across the backs of the wearer's hands. They allow the wielder to "weave" illusions as often as desired. Creating a silent image is a free action (Will DC 11 disbelief). Weaving a minor image requires a standard action (Will 13 disbelief). Creating a major image requires a full-round action (Will DC 14 disbelief). You can't create more than one illusion per round using the figment weavers. Using figment weavers incurs attacks of opportunity as if the wearer were casting a spell (though the wearer may make a Concentration check to cast defensively if desired).
#    Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, Forge Ring, major image, minor image, silent image; Market Price: 18,000 gp.

Shoes of Agility	COST:2500	TYPE:Boot.Footwear.Footgear	SPROP:These soft-soled shoes grant a +5 competence bonus to the wearer's Balance, Climb, and Tumble skill checks. [Caster Level: 5th]

#How I Determined the Prices
#Handflower of Grace: This one is relatively simple. A +2 enhancement bonus to an ability score costs 2 squared, times 1000 gp, for a total of 4,000 gp. A second equal bonus would costs 200% of this, or 8,000 gp. Together, they would cost 12,000 gp in a single item. Since the handflower takes up multiple item "slots," it only costs one-half this price, or 6,000 gp.
#Ring Bracers of Shielding: The deflection bonus is easy-it's one-third the cost of an equivalent ring of protection: 667 gp, 2,667 gp, 6,000 gp, 10,667 gp, and 16,667 gp for +1 through +5, respectively.
#    For immunity to magic missile, I first looked at the brooch of shielding. Since it has a limited number of charges, I decided that its price was too low to use for this effect (which is unlimited for the ring bracers). Instead, I priced it as if it used spell immunity (magic missile). I multiplied the spell level (4) by the caster level (7) and then by the base price for a permanent item (2000), for a total of 56,000. Since this item doesn't let you select what spell to immunize yourself against, it's not as valuable as an item that simply casts spell immunity, and thus I halved the value to 28,000 gp. Since it's part of a ring bracer, I then multiplied this by one-third to reach a total of 9,333 gp.
#    Adding this value to the deflection costs listed above, I see that the ring bracers of deflection will cost 10,000 gp (+1), 12,000 gp (+2), 15,333 gp (+3), 20,000 gp (+4), and 26,000 gp (+5). At the low end, this is significantly more than the price of an equivalent ring (since the immunity to magic missiles represents a greater fraction of the market value). However, the price of the ring bracers goes up very slowly, suggesting that many characters may simply skip over the +1 or +2 versions. That's not really what I'm looking for, so I decide to tweak the prices slightly. I knock the prices for the +1 and +2 ring bracers down a bit and raise the prices of the +4 and +5 to widen the gap and create a smooth progression in value.
#Figment Weavers: The figment weavers have three different powers: Major image, minor image, and silent image. If I priced this as a standard magic item, I would start by multiplying each effect's spell level (1, 2, or 3) by the item's caster level (5) and then by 2,000 gp. This gives me prices of 30,000 gp (major image), 20,000 gp (minor image), and 10,000 gp (silent image). Normally, an item with three different powers would cost extra (an additional 100% of each of the secondary powers' prices), but these powers are so similar that I decide to increase the value by only 50% of each power. (That's purely an ad hoc decision, and we'll see how it comes out. If it doesn't look right, we'll try again.) That means that the three powers cost 30,000 gp (you don't increase the most expensive power), 30,000 gp, and 15,000 gp. That gives me a total of 75,000 gp for the item. Since this is a full pair of ring bracelets, I multiply this price by one-third to get a total of 25,000 gp. I'll reduce it by another 10% or so since it incurs attacks of opportunity (something that's rare among wondrous items), bringing us down to 22,500 gp.
#   That still seems a bit high-remember, this should be comparing favorably to items costing up to three times its value-so I go back to the point at which I priced out the multiple powers and decide to eliminate the increase in cost (the powers are so similar that it's not like you're getting a big bonus for being able to use all three). Thus, I'm back to an item that costs 30,000 gp plus 20,000 gp plus 10,000 gp, or 60,000 gp. One-third of this is 20,000, minus 10% for incurring attacks of opportunity is 18,000 gp. I don't want to go any lower as yet, so I'll introduce it at this price and see if that seems reasonable in the game.
#Shoes of Agility: The Dungeon Master's Guide tells us that a +5 bonus to a skill check is worth 5 times 5 times 20 gp, or 500 gp. Additional equal bonuses are worth the same amount but are doubled because they represent multiple powers, thus 500 + 1000 (500 doubled) + 1000 (500 doubled) gives us 2,500 gp.
#   Other items of a similar value include the cloak and boots of elvenkind, slippers of spider climbing, and boots of the winterlands. That seems to be the right neighborhood for the shoes of agility.



###Block: Holding Stuff
Everfull Component Pouch	TYPE:Magic.Holding	COST:2000	SPROP:This plain leather belt pouch always contains any spell component or focus (maximum value 1 gp) required by its owner. What's more, the component or focus instantly appears in hand whenever the wearer begins casting a spell. Though this is of little use in most situations, it proves very useful if the caster is grappling or pinned, since he doesn't have to reach the components himself. Any component or focus not used to cast a spell within one round disappears back into the pouch (and thus can't be sold or traded by the owner). If the owner stores his other components or foci in the pouch, it delivers them in the same manner. [Caster Level: 3rd]
#    Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, locate object; Market Price: 2,000 gp; Weight: --.
Handy Scroll Tube			TYPE:Magic.Holding	COST:8000	WT:1			SPROP: This adamantine tube will hold up to 100 scrolls or similar items (anything of the size and flexibility of a sheet of parchment). When the owner reaches into it for a scroll, that scroll is always the first one he finds. Thus, no searching through the pages is ever necessary. Drawing a scroll from the tube is a move-equivalent action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. In addition, the caster level of any spell cast from a scroll taken from this tube is increased by +1 for all purposes. This increase only applies if the owner begins casting the spell on the same turn he pulled the scroll from the tube (even if the casting time is longer than one standard action, as long as the casting begins on the same turn, the effect applies). If a scroll has more than one spell, it must be put back into the tube before the caster level increase will apply again. The tube has a hardness of 20 and 20 hp, making it an excellent safeguard for its contents as well. If the tube's power is suppressed or dispelled, the scrolls remain within, but cannot be accessed until the item functions once again. [Caster Level: 6th]
#	Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, read magic; Market Price: 8,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
Handy Wand Case			TYPE:Magic.Holding	COST:2000		SPROP:Like the handy scroll tube, this six-pocket cloth sheath is a boon to spellcasters. Each pocket of the case can hold a single magic wand. With the merest thought (a free action), the wearer can summon any wand from the case into his hand. At the end of the round--or when the caster finishes activating the wand, for spells with a longer casting time--the wand magically disappears back into the case. If the case's power is suppressed or dispelled, the wands remain within, but cannot be accessed until the item functions once again. [Caster Level: 4th]
#    Caster Level: 4th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, unseen servant; Market Price: 2,000 gp; Weight: --.
Bottomless Money Pouch		TYPE:Magic.Holding	COST:2200		SPROP: This leather belt pouch can hold an infinite quantity of coins (copper, silver, gold, or platinum only). If any other item is placed within, the pouch spits it out one round later. The pouch is also enhanced to resist thievery; any Pick Pockets attempt made to steal it from its wearer suffers a -10 penalty. If the pouch's power is suppressed or dispelled, the coins remain within, but cannot be accessed until the item functions once again. [Caster Level: 9th]
#    Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest; Market Price: 2,200 gp; Weight: --.
Quiver of Arrow Creation	TYPE:Magic.Holding	COST:1500	WT:1		SPROP:This simple quiver appears to hold 20 masterwork arrows within it. However, each arrow exists in a state of flux within the quiver, its physical properties not yet fully determined. When the wearer draws an arrow (a free action, as normal), he mentally chooses the material from which the arrowhead is forged (adamantine, alchemical silver, or cold iron, as described in the DMG). Once drawn, the arrow exists for only one minute, but for that minute functions exactly as a masterwork arrow of the chosen material and of an appropriate size for the user. Once all 20 arrows have been drawn, the quiver loses its power. Additional arrows cannot be added to the quiver.
#    Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate; Market Price: 1,500 gp; Weight: 1 lb.
Quiver of Endless Arrows	TYPE:Magic.Holding	COST:900		WT:3	SPROP:This quiver is a boon to the expert archer, for it magically creates an endless supply of masterwork arrows (of an appropriate size for the wearer). Each arrow exists for only a single round after it is drawn. The arrows don't exist until they are drawn, so they can't receive magical enhancements while still "in the quiver," even by such means as greater magic weapon (though such effects can be added after the arrow is drawn).
#    Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, minor creation; Market Price: 900 gp; Weight: 3 lb.
Vest of Storing		TYPE:Magic.Holding	COST:4000	SPROP:This soft leather vest has four distinct "emblems" sewn into it. When the wearer touches an item to an emblem (a move-equivalent action), the item disappears into an extradimensional space. If the wearer later touches the emblem (another move-equivalent action), the item appears in that hand. Only one item can be "stored" in each emblem, and each item must weigh no more than 20 pounds and be able to be held in one hand. If the vest's power is suppressed or dispelled, the items appear and fall to the floor. Neither storing nor retrieving an item provokes attacks of opportunity, making it an ideal storage space for otherwise hard-to-retrieve items such as scrolls or musical instruments. [Caster Level: 6th]
#    Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, shrink item; Market Price: 4,000 gp; Weight: --.
