Fiery			KEY:FIERY			TYPE:Armor		VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Armor									PLUS:4	SPROP:When this armor is activated (requiring a command word from the wearer), the armor burns with a blue-white flame for 10 rounds. This fire does not harm the wearer or any of his possessions, but anyone touching or striking the wearer suffers 1d6 points of fire damage. The armor may be activated five times per day. [Caster Level: 10th]
Healing		KEY:HEALING			TYPE:Armor		VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Armor									PLUS:4	SPROP:The wearer of this armor can spend a standard action to cast cure light wounds on himself five times per day. In addition, once per day when the wearer of this armor is reduced to less than half his total hit points, the armor casts cure critical wounds on the wearer. This is an automatic action that requires no action on the part of the wearer. [Caster Level: 7th]
Mighty Bulwark	KEY:MIGHTY BULWARK	TYPE:Shield		VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PRETYPE:2,Enhancement,Shield									PLUS:4	SPROP:At a command, the mighty bulwark shield grows to the size of a tower shield though it retains its normal weight and armor check penalty (you suffer the tower shield's arcane spell failure chance when in that form). When the shield is in this form, any creature attempting to approach within 10 feet of you from the direction the shield faces must make a Will save (DC 19) or be unable to approach. This save must be repeated each round, regardless of success or failure. A creature within the area of effect that fails its save cannot approach any closer to you. The effect doesn't push back a repelled creature if you approach it. The mighty bulwark shield doesn't prevent creatures from making ranged attacks against you, nor does it repel melee attacks made from outside the area of effect (such as by a creature with reach). [Caster Level: 11th]
