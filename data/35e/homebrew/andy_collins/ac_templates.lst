#Creating a Wight
#The wight template can be applied to any humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or giant (but see Celebrity Game Table for a version of this template as applied to a dragon). The creature's type changes to "undead." It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

#    Hit Dice: Change to d12.
#    Speed: Same as base creature.
#    AC: Increase natural armor by +4
#   Attacks: The wight retains all the attacks of the base creature and also gains a slam attack if it didn't already have one.
#    Damage: Wights have slam attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use the damage values listed here: Fine/Diminutive 1 pt; Tiny 1d2; Small 1d3; Medium 1d4; Large 1d6; Huge 1d8; Gargantuan 2d6; Colossal 2d8. Creatures with natural attacks retain their old damage ratings or use the values listed above, whichever is better.
#    Special Attacks: A wight retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains those listed below. Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 the wight's HD + the wight's Cha modifier.
#        Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a wight's slam attack receive one negative level. A Fortitude save 24 hours later prevents it from becoming permanent.
#        Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or giant slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death.
#    Special Qualities: A wight retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains the undead type.
#        Undead: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.
#    Saves: Same as base creature
#    Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +2, Dex +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As undead creatures, wights have no Con score.
#    Skills: Wights gain a +8 racial bonus to Move Silently checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.
#    Feats: Wights gain the Blind-Fight feat, assuming the base creature doesn't already have this feat.
# 
# 
#    Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground
#    Organization: Solitary, gang (2-5), or pack (6-11)
#    Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1
#    Treasure: None
#    Alignment: Always lawful evil
#    Advancement: By character class
# 
#Wight Characters
#Wights are always lawful evil, which causes characters of certain classes to lose their class abilities, as noted in Chapter 3: Classes in the Player's Handbook. In addition, certain classes suffer additional penalties.
#     Clerics: Clerics lose their ability to turn undead but gain the ability to rebuke undead. This ability does not affect the wight's creator.
#      Wight clerics have access to the Death, Evil, Law, and Trickery domains.
#    Sorcerers and Wizards: These characters retain their class abilities, but if a character has a familiar (other than a rat or bat), the link between them is broken, and the familiar shuns its former companion. The character can summon another familiar, but it must be a rat or bat.
