# Demon-Possessed Creature Powers

Balor: Flaming Body (Su): When a balor-possessed creature is involved in a grapple, flames spring to life all over its body. Any creature grappling with it takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round that the grapple continues. Neither the balor-possessed creature nor its equipment takes damage from this eff ect.

Nalfeshnee: Smite (Su): Three times per day, a nalfeshnee possessed creature can cause a burst of unwholesome, multicolored light to explode from its body in a 60-foot radius. Every creature other than a demon in this area must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 nalfeshnee possessed creature's character level + nalfeshnee possessed creature's Cha modifier) or be dazed for 1d10 rounds. Th e nalfeshnee-possessed creature is immune to this effect.
Quasit: Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect good, detect magic; 2/dayinvisibility. Caster level equals quasit possessed creature's character level.

# Special Qualities: A demon-possessed creature retains all the base creature's special qualities and gains those described here.
Damage Reduction (Su): The demon-possessed creature gains damage reduction 10/cold iron.
Possessed (Su): Each demon-possessed creature is inhabited by a specific demon. The demon can neither control the possessed creature nor read its mind, and it perceives only what the possessed creature does. The possessed creature's alignment changes to chaotic evil until the possession ends. The demon is in constant telepathic communication with the possessed creature, imparting its thoughts and desires regardless of language. To gain the possessed creature's cooperation, the demon usually offers telepathic suggestions that it thinks a chaotic evil creature might find appealing. While possessing another creature, the demon does not have access to any of its supernatural, spell-like, or extraordinary abilities. It cannot cast spells or take purely mental actions beyond thinking and using Intelligence-based skills. It cannot be targeted by any spell or effect (except as described under spell vulnerability), but it can be detected normally by divination spells. Damage that harms the possessed creature does not harm the possessing demon. If the possessed creature dies, the demon appears in its square. The demon can exit the possessed creature at any time as a standard action. When it does so, it appears in the nearest available open space.
Poison Resistance (Ex): A demon-possessed creature gains a +2 resistance bonus on Fortitude saves against poison.
Resistance to Electricity (Ex): A demon-possessed creature has electricity resistance 20.
Spell Vulnerability (Ex): Certain powerful spells have special additional effects against demon-possessed creatures. Th ese spells must first overcome the demon's spell resistance (if any) to have any effect. A demon-possessed creature subjected to a dispel chaos or dispel evil spell must succeed on a Will saving throw or lose all the modifi cations bestowed by the demon-possessed creature template for a number of rounds equal to the opponent's caster level. The demon is immediately ejected from the possessed creature's body and appears in the nearest open square. A demon-possessed creature subjected to a banishment spell must succeed on a Will saving throw or lose the template until again possessed by a demon. Failure returns the demon to its home plane, as noted in the spell description. An antimagic field or any antimagic effect suppresses all the effects of the demon-possessed creature template. It also prevents the demon from communicating with the possessed creature, using its perceptions, and exiting its body (unless it dies) for as long as the demon-possessed creature remains in the antimagic area. In addition, particular spells can affect the weaker demon kinds, as noted on the following table. In each case, when the spell indicated for that demon (or any demon of higher CR on the table) targets the demon-possessed creature, the demon is expelled as described for dismissal (above), assuming that the creature fails any associated saving throw and the spell penetrates the demon's spell resistance. Spells cast by the possessed creature do not have this effect.

# Demonic Quality: Th e exact demonic qualities bestowed depend on the kind of demon that infused the base creature with its power, as follows.
Babau: Protective Slime (Su): A slimy red jelly coats the babau-possessed creature's skin. Any weapon that touches it takes 1d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive goo, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon is entitled to a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 demon-possessed creature's character level + demon-possessed creature's Cha modifier) to negate this damage. A creature that strikes the babau-possessed creature with an unarmed attack or natural weapon is also subject to this damage but may attempt a Reflex save at the same DC to negate it.
Balor: 
See Invisibility (Su): A balor-possessed creature continuously sees invisible creatures and objects as though with the see invisibility spell (caster level 20th).
Spell Resistance (Su): A balor-possessed creature has spell resistance equal to 10 plus its character level.
