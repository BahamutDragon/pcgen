Community																													SOURCEPAGE:p.75	DESC:You are especially good at cooperative spellcasting (see page 73). When casting an extended rite with multiple casters, not all the casters need have the exact spell being cast; any spell of the same level may be expended to gain the benefits of the rite. Whichever caster has the spell that is the subject of the rite must be the primary caster.

Doorways																													SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:Once per day, you may silently invoke the ability to see and hear all ethereal creatures (including nearby spirits of the dead) for 10 minutes per priest level.

Fate																														SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:The Hand of Fate guides you on your progress through life, and may actively intervene on your behalf once per day. This extraordinary ability allows you to reroll one roll that you have just made, before the GM declares whether the roll was a success or failure. You must take the result of the reroll, even if worse than the first roll.

Judgement		CSKILL:Sense Motive																								SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:Once per day, you may invoke an aura of occlusion around yourself that forces anyone attempting to strike or otherwise directly harm you to first make a Will save (DC 11 + your Wis modifier). If the save succeeds, the attacker may proceed and is unaffected by the aura thereafter. If the save fails, the attacker cannot follow through on his attack and may not attack you again for the duration of the aura's effects. The aura persists for 1 minute per priest level. If you attack or cast a damaging spell, the aura fades away immediately.

You must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse than the original roll.

Prophecy																													SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:All your divination spells require only a verbal component to cast. Divination spells with no verbal component may be cast silently by will alone. This ability does not waive the need for non-material cost, like the expenditure of XP.

Vengeance																													SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:Once per day, you may invoke a retributive strike. This retributive strike is a supernatural ability that produces a necromantic effect. You must succeed in a melee touch attack against a target creature. After a successful touch, roll 1d6 per priest level you possess. If the total equals or exceeds the target's hit points, the creature dies (no save). If the target is undead, you must expend a Turn Undead attempt to destroy it.
