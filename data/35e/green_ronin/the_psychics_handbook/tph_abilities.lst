Reqirements: Psychometabolism feat Check: Whenever you are required to make a Fortitude save or Constitution check to resist the eff ects of the environment, you can make an Adaptation check instead, using your psychic ability to improve your ability to withstand diff erent environments.

DESC:&nl; Slow Breathing: You can deliberately slow your rate of breathing so that you consume less air, vital in situations where there is only a limited amount of breathable air available.	DESC:&nl; Ignore Pain: You can ignore the eff ects of pain or injury while awake or asleep. If you choose, nothing can wake you, as long as you make a successful Body Control check.	DESC:&nl; Body Awareness: Conversely, you can become very aware of your body while asleep or concentrating.

DESC:&nl; Overcome Disease or Poison: By concentrating for a full round, you can substitute your Body Control skill check for your Fortitude saving throw against a disease or poison in your system.

Special: You can take 10 on Body Control checks, but you can't take 20. Time: Body Control is a full-round action. The effects last as long as you concentrate. Strain: DC divided by 5.

Psychic (Apport)			KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Psychic (Apport)			SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_A		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:You can teleport a target as a standard action. Distance is not a factor. The base DC is 10, modified by the object's mass, its familiarity to you, and the familiarity of the destination. For example, apporting a 10-pound object (DC +0) that is in your line of sight (DC +0) to a destination in your line of sight (DC +0), such as apporting an opponent's weapon into your hand, is DC 10. Apporting the same object in your line of sight to a somewhat familiar destination (DC +15) is DC 25. If the object is out of your line of sight and only somewhat familiar, the DC is increased to 40, and so forth. Generally, the DC of apporting an adult human is +10 for mass, plus familia rity modifiers. Unwilling creatures get a Reflex saving throw to resist apportation of themselves or any object they are wearing, carrying, or holding. A successful save means there is no effect. You must apport an entire object, not simply part of it, although unattached materials may be left behind. For example, you can apport a rope or p air of manacles without affecting the creature bound by them. Targets cannot be apported inside other solid objects: attempts to do so Simply fail, although the Gamemaster may permit the apported target to appear in the nearest open space to the desired destination. &nl; [Special] You can take 10 on an Apport check, but you can't take 20.&nl; [Time] Apport is a standard action.&nl; [Strain] 1 plus familiarity and mass modifiers.

The base DC is 10, modified by the familiarity of the destination and the amount of additional mass you are carrying (apart from yourself). You choose whether objects you are touching are carried along or left behind (allowing you to teleport out of things such as ropes and manacles, or your clothes, for example). You cannot teleport only part of an object or creature. All the material must be touching you or another solid object that is touching you for it to be carried along. Creatures that do not wish to be taken along can make a Will saving throw. If the save is successful, they're left behind. A failed Teleport check means you don't go anywhere. &nl; [Special] You can take 10 on a Teleport check, but you can't take 20.&nl; [Time] Teleport is a move action. &nl;Strain 1 plus familiarity and mass modifiers.

If the target's save fails, you get a general idea of his emotions and mood. This grants you a psychic bonus on the next skill check you make against the subject within the next 10 rounds (1 minute) using any of the following interaction skills - Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, or Sense Motive. &nl; Special - You can take 10 when making an Empathy check but you can't take 20.

The base DC is 10, modified by fami liarity. If the subject has a Psychic Shield, you have to make a Mental Contact check to overcome it. An unwilling subject gets a Will saving throw to avoid contact. If the save is successful, no contact is made. If you do not want the subject to know that you are making mental contact, you can make a Mental Contact check against the subject's Wisdom, Psychic Sense, or Psychic Shield check (whichever has the highest bonus). If you win, the subject is unaware of your attempt. If the subject wins, he is aware of your attempt (whether you succeed or fail). While you are in mental contact with another creature, the two of you can communicate at the rate of normal speech, "hearing" each other's transmitted thoughts. You can also send a single visual image each round instead of speaking. Both you and the subject can choose to lie or omit information; you're "speaking" to each other telepathically, not reading each other's thoughts. Mental contact is two-way, meaning that you are in mental contact with the subject for purposes of his psychic skills and vice versa. If a friendly mental contact turns hostile, the subject can make a Will saving throw or Psychic Shield check to break contact. Once the subject has failed a Will save to eject the intruder from his mind, he can't break the contact. The intruder is in his mind until he chooses to break contact or some outside force interferes, such as a distraction or another psychic skill such as Psychic Shield or Psychic Static. If your mental contact is broken, any other psychic skills you are maintaining that require mental contact are also broken.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens them, but normal noise does not. Awakening the creature requires a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
