# Ability Name			Unique Key								Category of Ability		Type						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								Source Page
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Eldritch Weaver ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Eldritch Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:An eldritch weaver is proficient with all simple weapons, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with an eldritch weaver's movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.19
Summon Familiar			KEY:Eldritch Weaver ~ Summon Familiar			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Eldritch Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:An eldritch weaver can gain a familiar in exactly the same manner as a sorcerer or wizard. See the Sorcerer class description and the accompanying Familiars sidebar in the PHB for details.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Minor Thread Power		KEY:Eldritch Weaver ~ Minor Thread Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Eldritch Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Starting at 4th level, the eldritch weaver achieves a special insight into the threads he knows, gaining access to special powers. Th e eldritch weaver can use one minor thread power for every thread from which he knows at least one spell of 2nd level or higher. Th e eldritch weaver spell list (see page 112) includes descriptions of all minor thread powers, most of which are supernatural abilities. When a thread power aff ects the eldritch weaver himself and has a variable duration, the eldritch weaver knows how long the effect will last when invoked. Unless otherwise noted in its description, using a minor thread power requires a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The eldritch weaver can select and use one of minor thread powers a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day), choosing from among the available minor powers for each use. An eldritch weaver can use the same minor thread power multiple times per day, or several diff erent minor powers once per day, up to his daily maximum.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Eldritch Weaving			KEY:Eldritch Weaver ~ Eldritch Weaving			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Eldritch Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, an eldritch weaver develops a special knack for casting spells from one of his chosen threads. Each time an eldritch weaver gains an eldritch weaving ability, he decides which thread to apply the ability to (applying multiple abilities to the same thread if desired), but once made, that assignment cannot be changed or undone. At 3rd level, the eldritch weaver selects one of his chosen threads, with spells from that thread becoming more potent. Whenever the eldritch weaver casts a spell from the selected thread, its effective caster level increases by +1 for purposes of determining level-dependent variables such as damage dice, range, and caster level checks. At 7th level, the eldritch weaver selects one of his chosen threads for which he knows at least one 3rd-level spell, gaining the ability to spontaneously cast spells from that thread. Th e eldritch weaver can "lose" any spell he has prepared in order to cast any spell he knows of a lower level from the selected thread. At 11th level, the eldritch weaver selects one of his chosen threads, with spells from that thread becoming more potent. Whenever the eldritch weaver casts a spell from the selected thread, add +1 to the spell's saving throw DC. Th is bonus does not stack with the Spell Focus feat, and Greater Spell Focus supercedes this ability. At 15th level, the eldritch weaver selects one of his chosen threads, gaining the ability to freely apply the effects of any of the following metamagic feats that he has taken to any spell in the thread of 3rd level or lower: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. Th e aff ected spell does not require a higher-level spell slot, and this power can be used a number of times per day equal to the eldritch weaver's Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day). If the eldritch weaver has assigned both this power and the spontaneous casting power gained at 7th level to the same thread, he can apply the metamagic effects to a spontaneously cast spell. As well, an eldritch weaver can apply this ability multiple times to the same casting (subject to his daily use limit), but cannot apply the same metamagic effect more than once to the same spell. For example, by expending two uses of this power, an eldritch weaver could cast an enlarged extended spell in its regular spell slot, but could not enlarge the same spell twice. At 19th level, the eldritch weaver selects one of his chosen threads, gaining the ability to freely apply the effects of any of the following metamagic feats he has taken to any spell in the thread of 6th level or lower: Enlarge Spell, Empower Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, Still Spell, or Widen Spell. Th e aff ected spell does not require a higher-level spell slot, and this power can be used a number of times per day equal to the eldritch weaver's Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day). If the eldritch weaver has assigned both this power and the spontaneous casting power gained at 11th level to the same thread, he can apply the metamagic effects to a spontaneously cast spell. As well, an eldritch weaver can apply this ability multiple times to the same casting (subject to his daily use limit), but cannot apply the same metamagic effect more than once to the same spell. If the eldritch weaver has applied both this ability and the minor metamagic ability gained at 15th level to the same thread, the daily uses of both abilities stack. In cases in which a metamagic effect could be applied to a spell by either ability, the eldritch weaver chooses which ability is being used.	SOURCEPAGE:p.20
Major Thread Power		KEY:Eldritch Weaver ~ Major Thread Power			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Eldritch Weaver Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 12th level, an eldritch weaver achieves additional insight into the threads he knows, and so gains access to special powers. Th e eldritch weaver can use his major thread power with a thread of his choice from which he knows at least one spell of 4th level or higher. Th e eldritch weaver spell list (see page 112) includes descriptions of all major thread powers, most of which are supernatural abilities. When a thread power aff ects the eldritch weaver himself and has a variable duration, the eldritch weaver knows how long the effect will last when invoked. Unless otherwise noted in its description, using a major thread power requires a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Th e eldritch weaver can use his major thread power a total number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day), choosing from among the available major powers for each use. An eldritch weaver can use the same major thread power multiple times per day, or several diff erent major powers once per day, up to his daily maximum. Th e eldritch weaver keeps separate track of his major and minor power use each day, and his use of one does not aff ect the other.

Activating this power is a full-round action, during which time the evangelist must vocally preach her beliefs. Once it takes effect, embolden the faithful extends outward in a 50-foot-radius emanation centered on the evangelist, and lasts for long as she concentrates plus a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1 round). At 3rd level, an evangelist with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) can use this ability to grant herself and her allies a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. To receive the benefit, an ally's alignment must share at least one common element with the evangelist's aura, and no opposing elements. For example, an evangelist with auras of law and good can grant the morale bonus to lawful good, neutral good, and lawful neutral allies. An ally must remain within the power's area of effect to receive its benefit. At 8th level, an evangelist with 10 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) can use this ability to grant a +2 morale bonus to allies.

A 3rd-level evangelist with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) can use this ability to cause enemies whose alignment contains one element opposing the evangelist's aura to become shaken. Such opponents within the emanation must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the evangelist's class level + the evangelist's Cha modifier). Th ose opponents who fail remain aff ected only as long as they remain in the power's area. If a foe who fails the save exits and then reenters the aura, he is still shaken as long as the aura remains. Foes outside the emanation when first activated must save upon entering it, whether it's their movement or the evangelist's movement bringing them inside. At 8th level, an evangelist with 10 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) causes foes in the area of effect to become dazed as per the spell for 1 round if they fail their saving throws, then are shaken for the duration of the effect. A foe can be dazed only once by each use of righteous wrath.

Starting at 4th level, a good evangelist (or a neutral evangelist who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures and an evil evangelist (or a neutral evangelist who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures, forcing them to cower in awe of her power. A neutral evangelist of a neutral deity (or an evangelist without a deity) must turn undead if she chose to cure wounds with her divine touch at 1st level, and must rebuke undead if she chose to inflict wounds.

BONUS:SKILL|Knowledge (Arcana),Spellcraft,Use Magic Device|2
Dispel Magic				KEY:Spellmaster ~ Dispel Magic				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spellmaster Class Feature.Class Feature.Supernatural																	DESC:At 14th level, a spellmaster's ability to disrupt other spellcasters becomes good enough she can use any spell she holds as a greater dispel magic. Before making the dispel check, the spellmaster must succeed on a roll of 1d20 + the level of the held spell or her spellmaster level (whichever is greater) against the opponent's caster level check. Whether the attempt succeeds or fails, the held spell is lost as if it had been cast.
Turn Spell					KEY:Spellmaster ~ Turn Spell					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spellmaster Class Feature.Class Feature.Supernatural																	DESC:At 15th level, a spellmaster has a chance to deflect hostile spells back toward an enemy. Whenever a spell has the spellmaster as a target and fails to penetrate her spell resistance, she can immediately make an opposed caster level check against the opposing spellcaster. If the spellmaster fails, she is aff ected normally. If she succeeds, she rebounds the spell back on the caster as if she herself had cast it.

Master Magic Savant			KEY:Spellmaster ~ Master Magic Savant			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spellmaster Class Feature.Class Feature																				DESC:At 19th level, any time the spellmaster makes a Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, or Use Magic Device check, she may roll twice and take the better of the two results.

Whenever a spell has the spellmaster as a target and fails to penetrate her spell resistance, she can immediately make an opposed caster level check against the opposing spellcaster.

If she succeeds, however, she absorbs the spell and gathers enough power to cast the spell herself (the absorbed spell need not be on the list of spells of which she is aware). Th is ability does not work against area effect or touch spells, and the absorbed spell counts against the spellmaster's limit on spells held (so if the spellmaster is already at her limit, she cannot absorb any additional spells).

Evasion				KEY:Thanemage ~ Evasion							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:At 2nd level, a thanemage can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a thanemage makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a breath weapon or fireball), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can only be used if the thanemage is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless thanemage (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.35
Bonus Feat				KEY:Thanemage ~ Bonus Feat						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 3rd level, the thanemage may select Armored Caster (new feat, see page 53), Combat Expertise, or Weapon Focus as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the normal may select Still Spell, or Spell Penetration as a bonus feat.

SOURCEPAGE:p.36
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Thanemage ~ Uncanny Dodge						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge						DESC:Starting at 7th level, the thanemage retains his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) even if caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker (though he still loses his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if immobilized.) If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class (such as barbarian or rogue), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead (see following).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.36
Adept Ability			KEY:Thanemage ~ Adept Ability						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 10th level, the thanemage can choose one of the following abilities (all of which replace previously chosen prerequisite abilities, as indicated), or an ability from the apprentice or initiate ability lists (so long as the thane mage has the appropriate ability prerequisite). If the thanemage chooses an apprentice or initiate ability he already has, he gains three extra uses of that ability per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Improved Evasion			KEY:Thanemage ~ Improved Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:At 13th level, a thanemage's evasion ability improves so that in addition to taking no damage on a successful Reflex save against spells such as fireball or a breath weapon, he now takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless thanemage (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Thanemage ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Uncanny Dodge						DESC:At 16th level, the thanemage can no longer be flanked, and can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. Th is defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack a scout by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the thanemage has class levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class (such as barbarian), the levels from both classes stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Grand Master Ability		KEY:Thanemage ~ Grand Master Ability				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 20th level, the thanemage can choose one of the following abilities (all of which replace previously chosen prerequisite abilities, as indicated), or an ability from the apprentice, initiate, or adept ability lists (so long as the thane mage has the appropriate ability prerequisite).

# Apprentice Ability
Aura of Dread			KEY:Thanemage Apprentice Ability ~ Aura of Dread		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Apprentice Ability.SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:Th e thanemage can unleash waves of supernatural power that cause discomfort to creatures with one of the following subtypes or types: air, earth, fire, water, chaotic, evil, good, lawful, or undead. Th e thanemage decides what type of creature the ability effects, and once made, that choice cannot be changed. Th e aura of dread extends in a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the thanemage, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 round) or until dismissed. A susceptible creature within the emanation must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the thanemage's level + the thanemage's Int modifier) or leave the emanation by the shortest route possible (and without moving any closer to the thanemage). Once they leave the emanation, creatures can act normally, but if unable to leave the area of effect, they become dazed unless attacked by the thanemage or one of his allies. Creatures make their saving throws when they first find themselves within the emanation, no matter how they came to be there (so a thanemage can move through a crowd of creatures, forcing them to flee his advance). A creature saves immediately upon being subjected to the aura of dread, but cannot flee until its turn if forced to do so by a failed save. Until its turn begins (or until attacked by the thanemage or one of his allies), a creature that fails its save is dazed. Once a creature has been aff ected by aura of dread or made a successful save against it, that creature cannot be aff ected by the same emanation again for 24 hours. A thanemage can have only one aura of dread in effect at a time. Th e thanemage can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier (minimum once per day). Th is ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.34
Spiritstrike			KEY:Thanemage Apprentice Ability ~ Spiritstrike			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Apprentice Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Th e thanemage can use the power of his own being to make a melee attack directly against a creature's spirit, creating a surge of supernatural power that deals 1d6 points of damage. As part of an attack or full attack, the thanemage can deliver the spiritstrike with a melee touch attack or in conjunction with a melee weapon attack (including an unarmed strike or natural weapon), but not in conjunction with a touch spell. When used as a touch attack, spiritstrike ignores damage reduction and can strike incorporeal creatures without the usual miss chance. Th e thanemage's Strength modifier does not increase spiritstrike damage, but a spiritstrike touch attack can deal a critical hit (20/x2). If using spiritstrike in conjunction with a weapon attack, the thanemage makes a normal melee attack for the weapon, dealing normal damage plus an additional 1d6. Such attacks can strike incorporeal creatures without the usual miss chance, and ignore damage reduction as though the weapon were magical. If the thanemage makes a confirmed critical hit with the weapon, the spiritstrike deals an additional 1d10 points of damage for weapons with a critical multiplier of x2, an additional 2d10 for a critical multiplier of x3, and an additional 3d10 for a critical multiplier of x4 or better. For example, a thanemage who makes a confirmed critical hit when using spiritstrike with a longsword deals 2d8 weapon damage + 1d6 spiritstrike damage + 1d10 spiritstrike critical damage (plus any applicable bonus damage). Th e thanemage can use spiritstrike a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier (minimum once per day).																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.35
Lesser Spiritshield		KEY:Thanemage Apprentice Ability ~ Lesser Spiritshield	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Apprentice Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:Th e thanemage can create an aura of energy to protects him from the attacks of creatures with one of the following subtypes or types: air, earth, fire, water, chaotic, evil, good, lawful, or undead. Th e thanemage decides what type of creature the ability effects, and once made, that choice cannot be changed. Against creatures of the chosen subtype or type, the thanemage gains a deflection bonus to Armor Class equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum +1). Th e thanemage can use lesser spiritshield a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day). Each use lasts 5 rounds or until dismissed.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.35
# Initiate Ability
Aura of Doom			KEY:Thanemage Initiate Ability ~ Aura of Doom			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Initiate Ability.SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected aura of dread. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's aura of dread ability, and aff ects the same type of creature chosen for the aura of dread. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of aura of dread, those additional uses apply to aura of doom. Aura of doom functions as aura of dread, except that a susceptible creature which fails its save must flee from the thanemage for 10 rounds (and without moving any closer to the thanemage). Th e creature also takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability and skill checks, and saving throws for 10 rounds. If unable to flee (including immediately after saving), an aff ected creature cowers unless attacked by the thanemage or his allies. Th is ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.36
Spiritbolt				KEY:Thanemage Initiate Ability ~ Spiritbolt			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Initiate Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected spiritstrike. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's spiritstrike ability. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of spiritstrike, those additional uses apple to spiritbolt. Spiritbolt functions as spiritstrike, except that the surge of supernatural power deals 2d6 points of damage and can be delivered from a distance. Th e spiritbolt can be hurled up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack, or can be delivered in conjunction with a ranged weapon attack (but not in conjunction with any spell). If used in conjunction with a ranged attack, the attack has the same range increment as the weapon used but ignores any range penalties at distances of 30 feet or less. If used in conjunction with a melee weapon attack, the spiritbolt deals an additional 2d6 points of damage, and deals the same additional critical damage as spiritstrike.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.36
Spiritshield			KEY:Thanemage Initiate Ability ~ Spiritshield			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Initiate Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected spiritshield. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's lesser spiritshield ability, and aff ects the same type of creature chosen for the lesser spiritshield. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of lesser spiritshield, those additional uses apply to spiritshield. Spiritshield functions as lesser spiritshield, except the effect extends in a 10-foot-radius emanation centered on the thanemage, granting him and all allies within the area of effect a deflection bonus to Armor Class equal to the thanemage's Wisdom modifier (minimum +1), and a resistance bonus of the same value to saving throws against spells and special abilities used by creatures of the chosen type.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.36
# Adept Ability
Scourging Aura			KEY:Thanemage Adept Ability ~ Scourging Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Adept Ability.SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected aura of dread and aura of doom. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's aura of doom ability, and aff ects the same type of creature originally chosen for aura of dread. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of aura of doom, those additional uses apply to scourging aura. Scourging aura functions as aura of doom, except that in addition to having to flee the area of effect, the emanation deals Charisma damage equal to 1d6 + the thanemage's Intelligence modifier. Th is ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Spiritlash				KEY:Thanemage Adept Ability ~ Spiritlash				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Adept Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected spiritstrike and spiritbolt. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's spiritbolt ability. If the thanemage gained any extra uses of spiritbolt, those extra uses apply to spiritlash. Spiritlash functions as spiritbolt, except that a bolt hurled as ranged touch attack has a range of 60 feet, and when used in conjunction with a ranged weapon attack, the attack ignores any range penalties at distances of 60 feet or less. As well, whenever a spiritlash attack hits, the lash attaches itself to the target creature, literally binding itself to the creature's essence. Th e lash remains attached for 1 round + a number of rounds equal to the thanemage's Charisma bonus (if any), and each round the lash remains attached, it makes normal melee attacks (no matter how the thanemage first attacked with the lash) using the thanemage's base attack bonus (which might allow it multiple attacks). Th e thanemage's Strength modifier does not apply to the lash's attack or damage rolls, but when attacking on its own, the lash can deal critical hits as spiritstrike.																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Spiritfield				KEY:Thanemage Adept Ability ~ Spiritfield				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Adept Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected lesser spiritshield and spiritshield. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's spiritshield ability, and aff ects the same type of creature originally chosen for lesser spiritshield. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of spiritshield, those additional uses apply to spiritfield. Spiritfield functions as spiritshield, except the field disrupts and confuses the senses of susceptible creatures within its area of effect, with such creatures suff ering a 25%% miss chance on any attack they make against the thanemage or any of his allies also within the area.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.37
# Master Ability
Expelling Aura			KEY:Thanemage Master Ability ~ Expelling Aura			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Master Ability.SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected aura of dread, aura of doom, and scourging aura. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's scourging aura ability, and aff ects the same type of creature originally chosen for aura of dread. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of scourging aura, those additional uses apply to expelling aura. Expelling aura functions as scourging aura, except susceptible creatures within the area of effect failing their saving throws are hurled bodily out of the emanation, traveling directly away from the thanemage to the closest edge of the area of effect. Expelled creatures take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet hurled, and must then flee from the thanemage as per the effects of scourging aura. If unable to be ejected (because blocked by a solid object, for example) or to flee (including immediately after saving), an aff ected creature cowers unless attacked by the thanemage or his allies. Th is ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Spiritbind				KEY:Thanemage Master Ability ~ Spiritbind				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Master Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected spiritstrike, spiritbolt, and spiritlash. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's spiritlash ability. If the thanemage gained any extra uses of spiritlash, those extra uses apply to spiritbind. Spiritbind functions as spiritlash, except that the surge of supernatural power does 2d8 points of damage and creatures struck by spiritbind are entangled for the duration of the attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.37
Spiritbarrier			KEY:Thanemage Master Ability ~ Spiritbarrier			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Master Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected lesser spiritshield, spiritshield, and spiritfield. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's spiritfield ability, and aff ects the same type of creature originally chosen for lesser spiritshield. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of spiritfield, those additional uses apply to spiritbarrier. Th is ability functions exactly as spiritfield, except if a susceptible creature actually hits the thanemage or any of his allies with a melee attack within the area of effect, that creature takes 2d8 points of damage from the field's supernatural energy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.37
# Grand Master Ability
Devastating Aura			KEY:Thanemage Grand Master Ability ~ Devastating Aura		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Grand Master Ability.SpecialQuality.SpellLike								DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected aura of dread, aura of doom, scourging aura, and expelling aura. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's expelling aura ability, and aff ects the same type of creature originally chosen for aura of dread. Devastating aura functions as expelling aura, except susceptible creatures within the area of effect that fail their saving throws are utterly destroyed, consumed by heatless arcane fire. Th is ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.38
Greater Spiritbind		KEY:Thanemage Grand Master Ability ~ Greater Spiritbind	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Grand Master Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected spiritstrike, spiritbolt, spiritlash, and spiritbind. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's spiritbind ability. If the thanemage gained any extra uses of spiritbind, those extra uses apply to greater spiritbind. Greater spiritbind functions as spiritbind, except the surge of supernatural power does 3d6 points of damage, a bolt hurled as ranged touch attack has a range of 90 feet, and when used in conjunction with a ranged weapon attack, the attack ignores any range penalties at distances of 90 feet or less. As well, creatures struck by greater spiritbind are pinned unless they make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the thanemage's level + the thanemage's Charisma modifier). A creature can attempt a save each turn in which it's pinned, but is still entangled if it succeeds. Breaking the pin is a standard action (see Chapter Eight: Combat in the PHB).

Greater Spiritbarrier		KEY:Thanemage Grand Master Ability ~ Greater Spiritbarrier	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thanemage Class Feature.Thanemage Grand Master Ability.SpecialQuality.Supernatural							DESC:To select this ability, the thanemage must have previously selected lesser spiritshield, spiritshield, spiritfield, and greater spiritbarrier. Th is ability replaces the thanemage's spiritbarrier ability, and aff ects the same type of creature originally chosen for lesser spiritshield. If the thanemage has gained any additional uses of spiritbarrier, those additional uses apply to greater spiritbarrier. Greater spiritbarrier functions as spiritbarrier, except susceptible creatures within the area of effect suff er a 50%% miss chance on any attack they make against the thanemage or any of his allies also within the area. As well, if a susceptible creature actually hits the thanemage or any of his allies with a melee attack within the area of effect, that creature takes 3d6 points of damage from the field's supernatural energy.

# Warpriest
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Warpriest ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:A warpriest is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Aura					KEY:Warpriest ~ Aura							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary						DESC:A warpriest of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to that deity's alignment (see the detect evil spell description in the PHB for details). A warpriest who doesn't serve a deity has an aura which corresponds to her own alignment. A neutral warpriest (or a warpriest of a neutral deity) has a good aura if she chooses to heal wounds with her divine power ability, or an evil aura if she chooses to inflict wounds with her divine power ability.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Divine Power			KEY:Warpriest ~ Divine Power						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:As a free action, once per day, a warpriest can call on the power of her faith and surround herself with an aura of positive or negative energy. A good warpriest (or a neutral warpriest who worships a good deity) wields positive energy, while evil warpriests (and neutral warpriests who worship evil deities) use negative energy. Neutral warpriests of neutral deities can do one or the other (player's choice), but once that choice is made, it cannot be reversed. Th e warpriest's divine power lasts for 1 round, with the effects noted below.	DESC:&nl;Minor Healing: If the warpriest channels positive energy, allies can use a standard action to touch her and heal damage equal to the warpriest's Charisma modifier + 1 (minimum 1 point). If the warpriest is unwilling to heal the ally for any reason, the ally must make a melee touch attack against the warpriest to be successfully healed. While the aura lasts, the warpriest can also use a standard action to impart the same healing effect to herself or to another creature. If the recipient is unwilling, the warpriest must make a melee touch attack to deliver the effect, or can combine the touch with an unarmed attack or with a natural weapon attack (if attacking creatures such as undead who are damaged by healing energy), but not with a weapon attack or a spell. If the warpriest channels negative energy, this ability deals damage equal to the warpriest's Charisma bonus (if any) +1, with the warpriest able to deal that damage or allow creatures healed by negative energy (such as undead) to touch her as above.	DESC:&nl;Light Healing: Th is ability functions as minor healing, except that the warpriest heals or inflicts 1d8 points of damage plus her positive Charisma modifier.	DESC:&nl;Moderate Healing: As minor healing, except that the warpriest heals or inflicts 2d8 points of damage plus twice her Charisma bonus (if any).	DESC:&nl;Serious Healing: As minor healing, except that the warpriest heals or inflicts 3d8 points of damage plus twice her positive Charisma bonus (if any).	DESC:&nl;Critical Healing: As minor healing, except that the warpriest heals or inflicts 4d8 points of damage plus twice her positive Charisma bonus (if any).						SOURCEPAGE:p.39
Divine Deflection			KEY:Warpriest ~ Divine Deflection					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural						DESC:Starting at 2nd level, the warpriest receives a deflection bonus to Armor Class when using her divine power ability so long as she doesn't wear heavy armor or use a tower shield. If the warpriest channels positive energy, the defection bonus applies only to attacks from evil creatures. If the warpriest channels negative energy, the defection bonus applies only to attacks from good creatures. Th is bonus increases by +1 for every three levels attained in this class (+2 at 5th, +3 at 8th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 14th, +6 at 17th, and finally +7 at 20th).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Turn or Rebuke Undead		KEY:Warpriest ~ Turn or Rebuke Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DEFINE:AllowExtraTurning|0	DESC:When a warpriest reaches 7th level, she gains the ability to turn or rebuke undead, usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of six levels lower would (see Turn or Rebuke Undead in Chapter Eight: Combat of the PHB). A good warpriest (or a neutral warpriest who worships a good deity) has the supernatural ability to turn undead. An evil warpriest (or a neutral warpriest who worships evil deities) can rebuke such creatures. A neutral warpriest of a neutral deity (or without a deity) must turn undead if she chose to cure wounds with her divine power at 1st level, and must rebuke undead if she chose to inflict wounds.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		BONUS:VAR|AllowExtraTurning|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.41
Weapon Specialization		KEY:Warpriest ~ Weapon Specialization				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warpriest Class Feature.SpecialQuality									DESC:At 10th level, the warpriest gains Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat, but only in her deity's favored weapon. The warpriest need not have Weapon Focus in this weapon to gain this feat, though if she does, she may select Greater Weapon Focus and Greater Weapon Specialization when she meets the prerequisites for these feats. If the warpriest already has Weapon Specialization in her deity's weapon, say through multiclassing into the fighter or psychic warrior classes, the warpriest may select any other feat instead, though she must meet the prerequisites as normal for this substitution feat.
