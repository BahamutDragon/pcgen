Armored Caster				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	DESC:You are skilled at weilding magic energies even while wearing armor.	BENEFIT:When wearing armor, you reduce the chance for arcane spell failure by -10%% (to a minimum of 5%%).
Crushing Charge				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.53	DESC:You can grind your foes underfoot with your powerful charge attacks.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, base attack bonus +10.	PREABILITY:2,CATEGORY=FEAT,Improved Bull Rush,Power Attack	PRETOTALAB:10	BENEFIT:If you hit a foe with your charge attack, you can immediately try to enter that foe's square and attempt to overrun him (provided you have sufficient movement available). The overrun attempt is resolved normally (including allowing your opponent an attack of opportunity and a chance to step aside). If your opponent blocks and your overrun attempts knocks him prone, you deal damage according to your size:	BENEFIT: 1|PRESIZEEQ:F	BENEFIT: 1d2|PRESIZEEQ:D	BENEFIT: 1d3|PRESIZEEQ:T	BENEFIT: 1d4|PRESIZEEQ:S	BENEFIT: 1d6|PRESIZEEQ:M	BENEFIT: 1d8|PRESIZEEQ:L	BENEFIT: 2d6|PRESIZEEQ:H	BENEFIT: 2d8|PRESIZEEQ:G	BENEFIT: 4d6|PRESIZEEQ:C	BENEFIT:&nl; If your charge attack drops your foe (by reducing his hit pints to 0 or lower, by knocking him prone, or by otherwise leaving him helpless) you can continue the straight line of your charge through your foe's space (provided you have sufficient movement to do so). If your base attack bonus allows you to make multiple attacks, you can continue making attacks as you charge until you run out of attacks or movement. Special: If you have the Mounted Combat feat, you can use Crushing Charge while making a mounted charge. Your mount makes the opposed Strength check to resolve the overrun, and if it knocks your foe prone, it deals damage according to its size as noted above. If you also have the Trample feat, its eff ects stack with this feat, with your mount dealing damage according to its size and making a free hoof attack as well. Your mount stops moving after one opponent has been overrun unless you make a DC 20 Ride check. If you continue making Ride checks, you can continue overrunning foes until your mount runs out of movement or you run out of attacks, but the Ride check DC increases by 2 for each additional attack you make. If you use this feat with natural weapons, your base attack bonus determines the maximum number of foes you can charge. You can use each of your natural weapons once during any series of attacks you make with this feat, but if you run out of natural weapons before running out of attacks, you must switch to a manufactured weapon (if you have one in hand or can draw one using the Quick Draw feat) or stop attacking.
Coordinated Melee Attack		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:You gain bonuses to your melee attacks when you and your allies gang up on an opponent.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Int 11, base attack bonus +1.	PRESTAT:1,INT=11	PRETOTALAB:1	BENEFIT:If you and at least two allies who also have this feat attack the same opponent in melee, you each gain a +2 bonus on your attack rolls. For each point of your Intelligence bonus, you gain an additional +1 bonus for each extra ally in the attack. You and your allies must all be within 30 feet of each other, you must have line of sight to each other, and you must all attack on the same initiative (typically by having all allies delay until the lowest initiative in the group). Special: In a unit battle (see Chapter Seven), you gain a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls if you and at least 2 allies who also have this feat attack the same enemy unit. In this case, additional allies don't increase your bonus.
Fighting Withdrawal			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:You can keep attacking while trying to pull out of combat.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Int 13, Combat Expertise.	PRESTAT:1,INT=13	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Expertise	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can make a single melee attack against one adjacent foe and then move up to your speed. As with the withdraw action, the first square you leave is not considered threatened, but if your attack hits, your movement this round does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the target. If you're allowed only a standard action or a move action during your turn, you can still make a fighting withdrawal but you can move only one-half speed. Normal: Without this feat, withdrawing from melee combat is a full-round action (or a standard action if you can take only a standard or move action during your turn), and you cannot attack while withdrawing. Special: In a unit battle, you can order the unit to attack any foe in melee contact with the unit and then withdraw from melee contact (see Orders, page 78). Th e unit cannot make another attack in the same turn.
Frightful Charge				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:Your charge is so frightening that foes flee before you.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Cha 11, base attack bonus +5, Intimidate 3 ranks.	PRESTAT:1,CHA=11	PRETOTALAB:5	PRESKILL:1,Intimidate=3	BENEFIT:As part of your charge attack, you can make an Intimidate check at a +2 bonus against the target of the charge and any other foes adjacent to you at the end of the charge. Foes that fail their level checks by 4 or less become shaken for 1 round, while foes who fail by 5 or more become frightened for 1d4 rounds and immediately flee from you along a route of their choice. A fleeing creature moves its speed, but this movement doesn't count against the creature's movement for its next turn. As well, this movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from you, but it might from any other creatures that threaten the fleeing creature's escape route. As well, if the target of your charge flees, you can continue the straight line of your charge if it would bring you into position to attack another foe. You can make another Intimidate check to shake or frighten the new target and any adjacent foes, but this counts as another use of the feat. You can use this feat a maximum of three times per day + your Charisma modifier. Special: In a unit battle, this feat allows you to force any unit you charge to make a morale check (normally a single charging creature forces a unit to make a morale check only if it is at least two size categories larger than the creatures in the unit). Compare your Intimidate check result with the unit's morale check result to determine results (see Morale on page 91). Frightful Charge can be selected as a fighter bonus feat.
Improved Coordinated Melee Attack	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:With aid from your allies, you can make an extra melee attack against a foe.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Int 11, Combat Reflexes, base attack bonus +5.	PRESTAT:1,INT=11	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Combat Reflexes	PRETOTALAB:5	BENEFIT:As the Coordinated Melee Attack feat, except if you or any of your allies hit the foe you attack, you can make an attack of opportunity against the foe. Th is counts against the total number of attacks of opportunity you can make during your turn. Special: Th is feat does not stack with the opportunist class feature.
Rapid Sniping				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:You can quickly conceal yourself when sniping with a ranged weapon.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dex 13, Hide 5 ranks, base attack bonus +6.	PRESTAT:1,DEX=13	PRESKILL:1,Hide=5	PRETOTALAB:6	BENEFIT:If you begin your turn hidden at least 30 feet away from your target, you can take the full attack action and then hide again as a free action (though you take a -10 penalty on the Hide check). Normal: When sniping, you hide as a move action, which allow allows you only a single attack with the attack action.
Share Lesser Divination			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.54	DESC:When you cast a low-level divination spell, nearby allies also gain the benefits of the spell.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Spell Focus (divination).	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Spell Focus (Divination)	BENEFIT:When you cast a divination spell of 3rd level or lower, allies within 30 feet of you learn what the spell reveals to you exactly as you learn it. For example, your allies could see what you see with the see invisibility spell or learn what you learn about magical auras revealed by detect magic. You can share only one divination spell with your allies at a time. If you have more than one divination spell active at the same time, you decide which spell to share as a free action. Upon casting the spell, you must decide which allies will share the spell, but you can change that decision each round as a free action. You must have line of sight and line of eff ect to each ally you wish to share a spell with, and allies which move more than 30 feet away from you, break line of sight, or break line of eff ect lose the shared spell (though you can use a free action to share the spell with that ally again). Special: In a unit battle, this feat allows you to share divination spells of 3rd level or lower with allies in the same space (though you must still have line of sight and line of eff ect to those allies).
Taunt						CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:You can make a foe's temper get the better of her.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Bluff 3 ranks.	PRESKILL:1,Bluff=3	BENEFIT:As a standard action, you can attempt to provoke a single foe within 30 feet of you into foolish anger. You make a Bluff check opposed by a special Sense Motive check from your foe, who adds her base attack bonus or her base Will save bonus to the check, whichever is higher. If the check succeeds, your foe becomes angry and takes a -2 penalty to AC, a -4 penalty on attack rolls against you, and a -2 penalty on attack rolls against any other target until the end of her next turn. If the foe is a spellcaster, she must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast any spell in her next turn. If the check fails, the character uses a standard action attempting to cast the spell but does not lose it. Th is ability is mind-aff ecting and language-dependent. Any penalties that would apply to a feint attempt apply to your Bluff check.
Thread Focus				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:Choose a thread, such as the Th read of Air. Spells in that thread that you cast are more potent than normal/	PRETEXT:Prerequisite: Int 13	PRESTAT:1,INT=13	BENEFIT:You cast all spells within the selected thread at +1 caster level. Special: You may select this feat multiple times. Its eff ects do not stack. Each time you select this feat, choose a new thread.
Wrath of the Faithful			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.55	DESC:You can use the forces of positive or negative energy to bolster your allies.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, Extra Turning.	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (religion)=5	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Extra Turning	BENEFIT:As a full-round action, you can make a turning attempt to bolster allies within a 50-foot-radius burst centered on you. Allies must have at least one alignment component in common with you and no opposing elements to be aff ected (for example, if you're lawful good, you can bolster allies who are lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good). To determine which allies you aff ect, make a turning check as though bolstering undead (see Chapter Eight: Combat in the PHB), calculating how many Hit Dice worth of allies you can bolster and the maximum Hit Dice (character level) of allies that can be aff ected. If you can't bolster all allies within range, you choose which ones are aff ected (subject to the Hit Dice limits from your tuning check and turning damage rolls). A bolstered ally gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks, plus a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class. Th e eff ect lasts 1 round + 1 round per point of your positive Charisma modifier.
