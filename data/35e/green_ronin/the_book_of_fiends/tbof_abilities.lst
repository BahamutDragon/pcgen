Fascination		KEY:Qlippoth Traits ~ Fascination	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Race Trait.Qlippoth Traits.SpecialQuality	DESC:As a standard action, qlippoth may change their coloration and posture to create a mind-boggling display  of shifting colors and forms that overloads the senses, rendering enemies helpless. Anyone within 30 feet who witnesses this effect must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the qlippoth's Hit Dice + the qlippoth's Charisma modifier) or be rendered helpless  for 2d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. Potential victims can attempt to avert their eyes by viewing the qlippoth through a mirrored surface, tracking its shadow, or using some similar trick. Each round, such opponents have a 50%% chance to not need to make a saving throw against the fascination attack. Opponents who cannot see the creature at all, due to closed eyes, the use of a blindfold, and so on, treat the qlippoth as if it has total concealment.	SOURCEPAGE:p.7

Weapon and Armor Proficiency				KEY:Thaumaturge ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thaumaturge Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality				DESC:Thaumaturges are proficient with all simple weapons plus the rapier. They are not proficient with any type of armor or with shields. Some demon princes have favored weapons, and many thaumaturges consider it a point of pride to wield the chosen weapon of their patron. A thaumaturge whose patron's favored weapon is a martial weapon and who chooses War as a domain receives the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat related to that weapon for free, as well as the Weapon Focus feat related to that weapon. See Chapter 5: Feats in the PHB for more information.																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Demonic Patrons, Domains, and Domain Spells	KEY:Thaumaturge ~ Demonic Patrons				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thaumaturge Class Feature.Class Feature			VISIBLE:DISPLAY	DESC:Choose a demonic patron for your thaumaturge. A list of thirty-one available patrons appears in Table 2-2: Demonic Patrons. A thaumaturge's chosen patron determines his motivations, ambitions, and the details of his obedience ritual. Refer to Chapter 3: Those Who Rule for complete details on most of these demon princes. When you have chosen a patron and an alignment for your thaumaturge, choose two from among the patron's domains for your thaumaturge's domains. You can only select a demon prince's alignment domain (Chaos or Evil) if your thaumaturge's alignment matches that domain. Each domain gives your thaumaturge access to a domain spell at each spell level, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. Your thaumaturge gets the granted power of all the domains selected. With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a thaumaturge prepares one or the other each day. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a thaumaturge can only prepare it in his domain slot. Domain spells and granted powers are detailed in Chapter 11: Spells of the PHB. Additional domains and granted powers can be found starting on page 17.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Thaumaturge Demonic Patrons|1	SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells		KEY:Thaumaturge ~ Alignment Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thaumaturge Class Feature.Class Feature			VISIBLE:DISPLAY	DESC:A thaumaturge cannot cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or to his chosen patron's (always chaotic evil).																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Bonus Language						KEY:Thaumaturge ~ Bonus Language				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thaumaturge Class Feature.Class Feature			VISIBLE:DISPLAY	DESC:In addition to the bonus languages available to a thaumaturge according to the rules for his race, all thaumaturges may learn Abyssal, the language of demons.																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Soulbound							KEY:Thaumaturge ~ Soulbound					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Thaumaturge Class Feature.Class Feature			VISIBLE:DISPLAY	DESC:The agreement that grants the thaumaturge his power also binds his soul to the fate of his chosen patron. Upon death, the thaumaturge's soul travels  to the home layer of that demon prince (regardless of whether or not the thaumaturge is himself chaotic evil). Only resurrection or true resurrection can return the soul to its mortal host, but barring such magic, the thaumaturge serves forever at the whim of his Abyssal lord. The soul might be consumed or destroyed, or even elevated to a position of respect and power (though always, of course, subservient to the demon prince). However, it is never released for any reason. Finally, soulbound characters always detect as evil, regardless of their actual alignment. The only way to change this aura is through magic.																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.10
