BONUS:VAR|WildEmpathy|CL	SOURCEPAGE:WoW pg. 72	DESC: Greater Power - Wild Empathy (Su): This greater power can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The healer rolls 1d20 + her path level + her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly (see Table 1-5: Influencing Attitude). To use wild empathy, the healer and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A healer can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intellect score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.
