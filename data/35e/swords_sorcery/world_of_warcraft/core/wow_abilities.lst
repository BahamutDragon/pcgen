This provides a Forsaken with numerous undead traits:	DESC:&nl;No Stamina score. Forsaken do not possess Stamina scores and gain no bonus hit points per Hit Die.	DESC:&nl;Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns and morale effects).	DESC:&nl;Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease and death effects.	DESC:&nl;Not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability drain or energy drain.

DESC:&nl;Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless).	DESC:&nl;Uses her Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.	DESC:&nl;Not at risk of death from massive damage. Unlike other undead, a Forsaken is not destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less. Instead, at 0 hit points a Forsaken is disabled. She can perform only one move action or standard action each round but does not risk further damage from strenuous activity. Between -1 and -9 hit points, the Forsaken is down. She is unconscious and cannot act, but she does not risk further damage (unless her enemies attack her or some other unfortunate event befalls her). At -10 hit points, the Forsaken is destroyed.	DESC:&nl;Not affected by raise dead and reincarnate spells or abilities. Resurrection and true resurrection can affect Forsaken. These spells return a destroyed Forsaken to her undead life; the Scourge's curse makes it virtually impossible to bring a Forsaken back to life as the creature she was before she died.

Arcane Corruption	KEY:Arcanist ~ Arcane Corruption	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The arcane energy that a necromancer or warlock uses will corrupt her. For every 5 levels of necromancer or warlock the character has, her alignment takes one step toward an evil alignment in line with her current alignment (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). For instance, if Higgins the human necromancer is lawful neutral at 1st level, at 5th level his alignment will shift to Lawful Evil. (For a more detailed arcane corruption variant rules system, see Magic & Mayhem.)
Arcane Path		KEY:Arcanist ~ Arcane Path		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Arcanists take levels in one of three "paths" (mage, necromancer or warlock), with each path casting spells from its own spell list and gaining special abilities that reinforce and enhance its particular brand of magic. Each path also faces certain restrictions when learning and casting spells from the spell list of another path (in the case of multiclassing).	DESC:&nl; All arcanists have these class features based on their chosen paths:	DESC:&nl; An arcanist can cast one additional spell per spell level per day from his specific spell list. A multiclassed arcanist must choose the path spell list for his additional spell; the path spell list need not be the same for each spell level. Thus, the arcanist receives only one additional spell per spell level per day, regardless of how many paths in which he has levels.	DESC:&nl; The save DCs of spells from the arcanist's path spell lists are increased by +1.	DESC:&nl; The arcanist receives a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells from his path spell list(s).	DESC:&nl; An arcanist acquires special abilities, called "arcana," at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and 16th level according to his path, as noted in Table 3-3: The Arcanist and described below.	DESC:&nl; Forbidden Arts: While all arcanists can cast spells from the general arcanist spell list, they face certain restrictions when casting spells from another path's spell list. They cast spells from another path's spell list with a -2 caster level penalty (minimum caster level 1st, but these penalties stack with those imposed by arcane addiction). The save DCs of such spells are reduced by -2, and there is a 2% chance per spell level of spell failure when casting spells from another path's spell list. Arcanists cannot learn spells from another path's spell list unless they have at least one level in that path. (See Chapter 16 for spell lists.) These restrictions apply to all but the arcanist's current path, which is the path in which she most recently took a level.
Scribe Scroll	KEY:Arcanist ~ Scribe Scroll		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, an arcanist gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.
Bonus Feat		KEY:Arcanist ~ Bonus Feat		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th level, an arcanist gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat or an item creation feat. The arcanist must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

# Mage Path:
Summon Familiar		KEY:Mage Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A mage can obtain a familiar. A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a mage. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar. A familiar also grants special abilities to its master, as indicated on Table 3-5. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other. Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level. See the "Familiar Basics" sidebar for more details on summoning familiars.
Call Elemental		KEY:Mage Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Once per day, the mage can summon an air, earth, fire or water elemental as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability is similar to summon monster, save that the duration is equal to 5 minutes per point of the mage's Intellect modifier. The elemental's size depends on the mage's level, as shown on the following table. The mage can use this ability twice per day at 12th level and three times per day at 20th level.
Enhanced Counterspell	KEY:Mage Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Mages understand the workings of arcane energy so well that they can counter most magic with great effectiveness. When attempting to counter a spell, a mage adds her arcanist path level to her counterspell check. In addition, the mage may counter a spell with any other spell she has prepared as long as it is the same level of the spell being countered and the spell being used to counter is from the same school of magic. Necromancy or conjuration (summoning) spells cannot be counterspelled in this manner by mages. Mages must use dispel magic to counter spells from those schools.
Arcane Adept		KEY:Mage Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A mage's dedication to and natural predilection for one of her schools of specialization becomes more entrenched. The mage chooses either evocation or transmutation as a preferred school. She casts spells from this preferred school at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Fire and Frost		KEY:Mage Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The mages of Kirin Tor first mastered the arts of casting spells using the elements of ice and fire. Mages may memorize an additional spell per level as long as it has the cold or fire elemental descriptor. This additional spell is cast with the effects of the Maximize Spell feat; however, the spell's level does not change. This ability stacks with the effects of the Maximize Spell feat, which does change the spell's level.

# Necromancer Path
Death Touch		KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:By wielding the forces of undeath, the necromancer draws vitality from the living. Death touch is a death effect. The necromancer must succeed on a melee touch attack against a living creature (using the rules for touch spells). When he touches, roll 1d6 per necromancer level he possesses. If the total at least equals the creature's current hit points, it dies (no save). The necromancer can use this ability once per day at 1st level, twice per day at 9th level, and three times per day at 18th level .
Death Resistance	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer becomes immune to all death spells and magical death effects. This immunity does not protect the necromancer from other sorts of attacks such as hit point loss, poison, petrification or other effects even if they might be lethal.
Animate Dead	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer may animate undead creatures using the vile magic at his disposal. This ability functions like the spell of the same name, but with the following exceptions. The necromancer may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his necromancer levels divided by 2 (1/ day at 1st level). The limit of undead the necromancer can control is equal to 2 Hit Dice per level. The amount of undead controlled by this ability counts toward the number that can be controlled with the animate dead spell as normally cast by the necromancer.
Dark Arts		KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Necromancers are skilled in wielding magic that causes pain, suffering and death. Mastering the dark arts allows the necromancer to cast spells from the necromancy school at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Create Undead	KEY:Necromancer Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The necromancer's knowledge of undeath reaches such unsurpassed depths that he can create powerful undead. He can use this ability like create undead twice per day or like create greater undead once per day. The ability is cast at the necromancer's path level.

# Warlock Path:
Fel Companion	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 1st Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 1st level, the warlock gains a fel companion. The warlock can summon the fel companion and dismiss it at any time so that he may summon a new one. The fel companion must be an evil outsider with a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than the warlock's arcanist path level (to a maximum of 10 HD). Should the fel companion die while in service to the warlock, the warlock must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save, at +1 DC for each HD of the companion. If the saving throw fails, the warlock loses 400 XP per warlock level; success reduces the loss to half of that amount. In addition, the warlock must make a DC 15 Will save or take 1d6 points of Stamina damage as the companion's sudden loss tears away part of the warlock's life force. A warlock can obtain another fel companion by performing a ceremony of summoning. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp per HD of the creature summoned. The creature serves as a willing companion and servant. Dismissing a fel companion is a free action, and a dismissed creature immediately returns to its plane of origin.
Summoner		KEY:Warlock Path ~ 4th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock receives the Augment Summoning feat for free. At 6th level, all conjuration (summoning) spells cast by the warlock have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat is applied to them. The level of an augmented conjuration (summoning) spell does not change; this ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell's level (see Chapter 6: Feats).
Enslave Outsider	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 8th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A warlock is adept at convincing outsiders to do his bidding. When a warlock casts lesser planar binding, planar binding, or greater planar binding, he can add his ranks in any one relevant Knowledge skill (the planes, especially the Emerald Dream and the Twisting Nether; demons; the Burning Legion, and so forth) or in Spellcraft, whichever is higher, to the caster level check or the Charisma check made to keep the outsider trapped.
Demonologist	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 12th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The craft of conjuration is the primary focus of the warlock, and in taking on the mantle of a demonologist the warlock sacrifices knowledge in other areas of arcane practice. The warlock casts conjuration (summoning) spells at +1 caster level, and the save DC for such spells increases by +2.
Demon Mastery	KEY:Warlock Path ~ 16th Level		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Arcanist Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The warlock has learned the compacts and rites necessary to bind a demonic creature to his will. The warlock rebukes and controls outsiders the same as an evil priest rebukes or commands undead. Use the warlock's arcanist path levels to determine the equivalent of a turning check, and apply the relevant outsider Hit Dice to the undead HD chart (see Chapter 12: Combat, "Turn or Rebuke Undead"). The warlock may also bolster outsiders he controls in the same way that an evil priest bolsters undead. The warlock can attempt to control or rebuke outsiders a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier; he may attempt to bolster outsiders that he did not summon himself.



###Block: Barbarian
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Barbarian ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor and shields (except tower shields).
Fast Movement			KEY:Barbarian ~ Fast Movement				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load he carries or armor he wears.
Illiteracy				KEY:Barbarian ~ Illiteracy				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak. A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he already had.
Rage					KEY:Barbarian ~ Rage					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Stamina and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Stamina increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Stamina score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Agility- or Intellectbased skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration; nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the barbarian's (newly improved) Stamina modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Agility, cannot charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below). A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Barbarian ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.63	DESC:At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Agility bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flatfooted or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Agility bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Trap Sense				KEY:Barbarian ~ Trap Sense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Barbarian ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to backstab the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If the barbarian already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank him.
Damage Reduction			KEY:Barbarian ~ Damage Reduction			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time a weapon or a natural attack deals damage to him. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by +1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
Greater Rage			KEY:Barbarian ~ Greater Rage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Stamina during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.
Indomitable Will			KEY:Barbarian ~ Indomitable Will			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.
Tireless Rage			KEY:Barbarian ~ Tireless Rage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.
Mighty Rage				KEY:Barbarian ~ Mighty Rage				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Barbarian Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.64	DESC:At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Stamina during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency			KEY:Healer ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:Healers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are proficient with light armor only.
Spells						KEY:Healer ~ Spells				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A healer casts divine spells, which are drawn from the healer spell list and the individual spell lists for each path. However, her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see "Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells," below. A healer must choose and prepare her spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a healer must have a Spirit score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a healer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the healer's Spirit modifier. Like other spellcasters, a healer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell slot allotment is given on Table 3-9: Healer Spell Slots per Day (her total healer level, regardless of path, is used to determine her spell slots per day). In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Spirit score. Healers meditate or pray for their spells. Each healer must spend 1 minute in quiet contemplation or supplication per level of spell being prepared to regain her daily allotment of spells. A healer may prepare and cast any spell on the healer spell list as well as the spell list of her specific path, if she can cast spells of that level, but she must meditate while preparing them.
Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells	KEY:Healer ~ Alignment Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A healer can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own. Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
Domain Spells					KEY:Healer ~ Domain Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.66	DESC:A healer gains a domain (or greater and lesser domains) belonging to her path and gains those domain abilities in addition to abilities normally available to the healer's path. In addition, she may prepare an additional spell of each level she can cast from her domain(s), and she receives an additional spell slot at each level that can only be used for a domain spell.
Healer's Path					KEY:Healer ~ Healer's Path			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Healers take levels in one of three "paths" (druid, priest or shaman), with each path honoring a specific philosophy and form of worship. The spells that healers cast and the special abilities they gain reinforce and distinguish the aims and beliefs of each path. All healers have these class features based on their chosen path:
Spontaneous Casting				KEY:Healer ~ Spontaneous Casting		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Healers can channel stored spell energy into casting spells that are not prepared. The healer can "lose" any prepared spell slot that is not a domain spell in order to cast certain spells of the same spell level or lower (see the description of each path below for specific details).
Turn or Rebuke					KEY:Healer ~ Turn or Rebuke			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:A healer has the power to affect certain creatures depending on her path and her alignment by focusing the power of her faith through a holy symbol or some other sacred item. Each path can turn or rebuke specific types of creatures. See the description of each path, below, for details. A healer can make a number of turn or rebuke attempts per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Healers with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) receive a +2 bonus on their turn or rebuke checks. See "Turning and Rebuking Undead" in Chapter 12: Combat.
Domains						KEY:Healer ~ Domains				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:Healers gain access to domains related either to the path or faith they follow. Domains grant healers special powers depending on their level of access. As well, healers can prepare an additional domain spell of each spell level they can cast, and they receive an additional spell slot at each level that can only be used for a domain spell. See Table 3-8: The Healer for when healers gain access to domains. Each domain grants special powers depending on whether a healer has lesser or greater access to it. Lesser access allows a healer to cast spells of up to 3rd level in a domain, while greater access allows a healer to cast any spell in a domain. Healers cast any spell on the healer spell list and on the spell list for their specific paths (see Chapter 16: Spell Lists), but they prepare an additional spell per spell level only from the domains to which they have access. When a healer has access to two domains (starting at 10th level), she must choose from which domain to prepare an additional spell for a particular spell level. See "Healer Domains," below, for descriptions of lesser and greater powers in each domain, as well as the lists of spells available to each domain.
Brew Potion						KEY:Healer ~ Brew Potion			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 1st level, a healer gains Brew Potion as a bonus feat.
Bonus Feat						KEY:Healer ~ Bonus Feat				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.67	DESC:At 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th level, a healer gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat or Spell Focus. The healer must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

Strider		KEY:Druid Path ~ Strider		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:The druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him, however. The druid also leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. He may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
Animal Companion	KEY:Druid Path ~ Animal Companion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, eagle, hawk, owl, pony, raven, snake (Small or Medium viper) or wolf. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted in the "Druid's Animal Companion" sidebar. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on Table 3-10. If a druid releases his companion from service, he may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished. A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see the "Alternative Animal Companions" sidebar). Should he select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated for the appropriate list from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on Table 3-10: Animal Companion Abilities by Master Level to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, he can't have that animal as a companion.)
Wild Shape		KEY:Druid Path ~ Wild Shape		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:The druid gains the ability to turn himself into a large raven or bird of prey. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until he changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. A druid loses his ability to speak while in animal form (because he is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make), but he can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as his new form. A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th and 18th level. In addition, he gains the ability to take the shape of a nightsaber cat at 8th level, a dire bear at 11th level, and an ancient at 15th level. (The nightsaber cat and the ancient are found in the Manual of Monsters.)
Dreamwalker		KEY:Druid Path ~ Dreamwalker		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	DESC:The druid may enter the Emerald Dream once per day, provided he is in a forested or wild area. This ability does not work in cities or blighted lands. Travel to and from the Emerald Dream functions like the spell plane shift. See "World of Warcraft" in the Introduction for a description of the Emerald Dream.
Group Stride	KEY:Druid Path ~ Group Stride		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:The druid can bestow the effects of the strider ability upon a number of beings of Small to Large size traveling with him. As long as the companions travel with the druid, they leave no tracks or trail, unless the druid chooses. The druid may exclude specific individuals from the effects of this special ability. This ability can affect a number of individuals equal to 6 + the druid's Spirit modifier.
Greater Dreamwalk	KEY:Druid Path ~ Greater Dreamwalk	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:The druid may choose to bring a number of companions equal to his Spirit modifier with him into the Emerald Dream when using his dreamwalker ability.
Timeless Body	KEY:Druid Path ~ Timeless Body	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	DESC:After attaining 16th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties he may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses for aging still accrue (see Table 7-3: Aging Effects), and the druid is considered effectively immortal. The druid cannot die of old age.

Augur				KEY:Shaman Path ~ Augur				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:The gift of the sight is a curse for many, but the shaman has long since mastered the ways of readings omens, signs and portents. Using the skill bestowed upon him by the spirits, the shaman can see into the spirit world and prophesy. He has the ability to cast the spell augury once per day as a spell-like ability; his caster level equals his shaman path level.
Flametongue/Frostbrand	KEY:Shaman Path ~ Flametongue/Frostbrand	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A shaman learns to capture an elemental spirit within a weapon he wields. By sacrificing any prepared spell slot of 1st level or higher, a shaman can imbue a weapon with either the flaming or frost special weapon properties. A weapon cannot bear both elemental weapon properties at once, and it loses its special property if it leaves the shaman's hands. A shaman can imbue a weapon this way once per day. Doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The property lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + his Spirit modifier (minimum 1 round). This property can be suppressed for 1d4 rounds by a dispel magic targeted on the weapon. The shaman gains an additional use of this ability per day at 8th and 12th level. A flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. A frost weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit.
Ghostwolf			KEY:Shaman Path ~ Ghostwolf			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:The shaman gains the ability to turn himself into a large wolf with a ghostly white pelt. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per shaman level, or until the shaman changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.
Purge				KEY:Shaman Path ~ Purge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:The shaman has learned how to snuff out the threads of magic that fuel spells empowering other creatures. The shaman can make a dispel check (1d20 + shaman's caster level, maximum +10) against any beneficial transmutation spell currently in effect on a target (e.g., bull's strength). The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If the shaman succeeds, the spell is dispelled; if he fails, the spell remains in effect, and the shaman cannot make another purge attempt against that specific spell (though he can attempt to dispel other transmutation spells in effect on a target, if any).
Rebirth			KEY:Shaman Path ~ Rebirth			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Healer Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.72	DESC:By sacrificing a prepared spell slot of 5th level or higher, the shaman can bring a dead comrade back to life. This ability functions exactly like the spell resurrection, with the following exceptions. The slain comrade cannot have been dead for more than 8 hours and must have the same affiliation or alignment as the shaman. A shaman may do this once per day at 16th level and twice per day at 20th level.

Sting					KEY:Hunter ~ Sting					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:A hunter can conjure poisons and apply them to projectiles as he fires or throws them. Three times per day, before making an attack roll with a ranged weapon, the hunter can declare that the attack is a sting of any type he knows. If the attack hits and deals damage, the poison takes effect (the exact effects depend on the sting's type, as described below). The hunter can use a sting three times per day at 1st level and one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. If the attack misses, the sting has no effect but is still used up. Creatures immune to poison are immune to stings.
Serpent Sting			KEY:Hunter ~ Serpent Sting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:The attack deals 1 additional point of damage, and the poison deals 1 point of damage each round for a number of rounds equal to the hunter's class level. Scorpid Sting: The target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the hunter's class level + the hunter's Spirit modifier) or lose 1d4 points of Strength and 1d4 points of Agility for a number of rounds equal to the hunter's class level. Viper Sting: The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the hunter's class level + the hunter's Spirit modifier) or be unable to cast spells for one full round. This sting has no effect on non-spellcasters.
Aspects				KEY:Hunter ~ Aspects					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.74	DESC:At 3rd level, a hunter's connection to the wilds allows him to adopt the natural attacks and defenses of the natural world. By mimicking certain aspects of a creature's behavior, the hunter gains animalistic abilities that appear impossible. A hunter may adopt only one aspect at a time. Switching aspects is a free action, though the hunter can switch aspects only once per round and only on his turn. The hunter can use any aspect he knows any number of times per day, and the aspect's bonuses last until the hunter switches aspects. No overt signs indicate that an aspect is active, although the hunter's behavior slightly. For example, a hunter adopting the aspect of the monkey moves with a lanky stride, arms swinging, but when he adopts the aspect of the hawk he makes sudden movements and his keen eyes dart about. A hunter can choose to have no aspect active if he wishes.	DESC:&nl:Aspect of the Monkey: The hunter gains evasion. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. The hunter can use evasion only if he is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless hunter (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.	DESC:&nl:Aspect of the Hawk: The hunter easily perceives his opponents' vulnerabilities. He gains +1 insight bonus on ranged weapon damage rolls for every three hunter levels he possesses, to a maximum of +5 at 15th level.	DESC:&nl:Aspect of the Beast: The hunter moves with the grace of an animal, allowing him to pass through natural terrain without leaving a trail and making him impossible to track. In addition, the hunter may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Magically manipulated thorns, briars and overgrown areas still affect him, however.	DESC:&nl:Aspect of the Cheetah: The hunter mimics the cheetah's legendary swiftness. His base movement rate increases by 5 feet for every five hunter levels he possesses.	DESC:&nl:Aspect of the Pack: The hunter reads his companions' movements with preternatural instinct, moving to support their attacks. When the hunter and an ally are both adjacent to an enemy, the ally is considered to be flanking that enemy.	DESC:&nl:Aspect of the Wilds: The hunter becomes deeply in tune with nature, granting him protection from the world's dangers. He gains a +4 insight bonus on all saving throws.
Tame Animal				KEY:Hunter ~ Tame Animal				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 5th level, the hunter gains a supernatural bond with animals that allows him to interact with them on a spiritual level. A hunter may attempt to tame any animal whose Hit Dice are equal to or less than his hunter level minus two. (A 10th-level hunter can attempt to tame an animal with up to 8 Hit Dice, for instance.) The hunter uses both natural and supernatural means to compel the creature to become his ally. To do this, the hunter must be within 30 feet of the creature and they must be able to see and hear each other. The attempt takes one round per Hit Die of the target. At the end of this time, the hunter must make a Handle Animal check (DC 18 + the creature's Hit Dice + the creature's Charisma bonus). He takes a -2 penalty on this check for every creature in the area (including PCs) that appears threatening to the target. If the check fails, the creature's attitude toward the hunter does not change, but the hunter cannot attempt to tame that creature again for 24 hours. If the hunter succeeds, the creature becomes the hunter's companion, and gains several benefits (see "The Hunter's Companion" sidebar). A hunter can have only one such companion at a time, and can release it whenever he wishes. If his companion is slain or released, he cannot attempt to tame another for 24 hours. If the hunter wounds or threatens a creature, he cannot attempt to tame that creature for 24 hours. Once tamed, a creature is loyal to the hunter and, if the hunter treats it well, serves him faithfully.
Eagle Eye				KEY:Hunter ~ Eagle Eye					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 7th level, a hunter's sight improves. The range increments for all ranged weapons he wields increase by 150%. (This ability stacks with the Far Shot feat.) He gains a +2 bonus on Spot checks, and his Spot checks take a -1 penalty for every 20 feet of distance between himself and the target, instead of -1 for every 10 feet (see Chapter 5: Skills).
Tame Magical Beast		KEY:Hunter ~ Tame Magical Beast			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Hunter Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.76	DESC:At 14th level, the hunter can tame magical beasts just as he can tame animals; however, he takes a -4 penalty on his Handle Animal checks to do so.

She must declare her intent to use holy strike before she makes her attack roll. If she hits, she deals 1d6 extra points of holy damage, +1 additional point of holy damage per paladin level. Her weapon is considered good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If the paladin misses with her holy strike, the strike has no effect but is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and at every 5 levels thereafter, the paladin may use holy strike one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 3-11: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.
Divine Grace			KEY:Paladin ~ Divine Grace				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma modifier on all saving throws.
Auras					KEY:Paladin ~ Auras					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.77	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin gains an aura. The Holy Light manifests around her in a tangible field and provides benefits to her and her allies. The aura extends from the paladin in a radius equal to 5 feet per point of Charisma modifier (minimum 5 feet) and affects the paladin and all allies within this area. Activating an aura is a free action, and the paladin can have only one aura active at a time. The aura lasts for one round per paladin level. At 3rd level, the paladin gains aura of might and can activate an aura once per day; she gains more auras and can activate them more often as she gains levels, as shown on Table 3??11. (The paladin's aura of good is persistent and does not count against her use of auras per day.) The paladin can also use a hero point to activate an aura that does not count against her auras per day. If she does so, the aura's radius doubles. When the paladin activates an aura, she can activate any aura she knows. For instance, a 6th-level paladin can activate an aura twice per day. In one day, she can activate a devotion aura twice, or an aura of might twice, or a devotion aura once and an aura of might once. When an aura is active, a colored glow wreathes the paladin and a circle of energy pulses at her feet. (The color depends on the aura.) Light of the same color dimly illuminates each affected ally. The aura provides shadowy illumination within its area. Some auras mimic spells of the same name; these auras' effects do not stack with the spells'.		DESC:&nl;Aura of Might: The paladin and her allies receive a +1 sacred bonus on damage rolls for every three paladin levels, to a maximum of +5 at 15th level.	DESC:&nl;Devotion Aura: The paladin and her allies receive a +1 deflection bonus to AC for every three paladin levels, to a maximum of +5 at 15th level.	DESC:&nl;Healing Aura: The paladin and her allies gain fast healing 1.	DESC:&nl;Retribution Aura: Any creature that deals damage with a melee attack to the paladin or one of her allies takes 2d4 points of holy damage, +1 point per the paladin's Charisma bonus (if any). The base damage increases to 3d4 at 15th level and 4d4 at 20th level.	DESC:&nl;Resistance Aura: The paladin and her allies gain spell resistance equal to 5 + the paladin's level.	DESC:&nl;Aura of Wisdom: Whenever the paladin or one of her allies casts a spell while within the aura, the paladin makes a Spirit check (DC 10 + twice the spell's level). If successful, the ally casts the spell but the spell slot is not expended. A natural roll of 5 or less on this check always fails.
Divine Health			KEY:Paladin ~ Divine Health				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.
Turn Undead				KEY:Paladin ~ Turn Undead				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a priest of 3 levels lower would.
Lay on Hands			KEY:Paladin ~ Lay on Hands				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.78	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, the paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. This is a powerful ability that drains all of the paladin's remaining spell slots. The target heals a number of hit points equal to 5 per level of each spell slot lost in this way. For example, if the paladin used her lay on hands ability and lost one 3rd-level, two 2nd-level, and four 1st-level spell slots, she lost eleven spell slot levels. The target regains 55 hit points. Using lay on hands is a standard action. Alternatively, the paladin can use lay on hands to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin deals 5 points of holy damage per level of each spell slot lost. The undead creature may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + the paladin's level + the paladin's Charisma modifier) to halve the damage. If the paladin attempts to use lay on hands and misses, the ability has no effect. The paladin may try again in the next round
Spells				KEY:Paladin ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. To cast a spell, a paladin must have a Spirit score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's Spirit modifier. Like other spellcasters, a paladin expends spell slots to cast her spells. Her base daily spell slots are given on Table 3-12: Paladin Spell Slots per Day. In addition, she receives bonus spell slots per day if she has a high Spirit score. When Table 3-12 indicates that the paladin gets 0 spell slots per day, she gains only the bonus spell slot to which she is entitled based on her Spirit score. Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.
Crusader Strike			KEY:Paladin ~ Crusader Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:At 5th level, a paladin can string together multiple holy strikes in a shining display  of holy fervor. If she hits a creature with more than one holy strike, each holy strike beyond the first deals additional damage equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) times the number of successful holy strikes against that creature. For example, Valdania is a 10th-level paladin with a Charisma of 17. If she hits a creature with two holy strikes, the second strike deals +3 extra damage. If she hits the same creature with a third holy strike, that strike deals +6 extra damage.
Fist of Justice			KEY:Paladin ~ Fist of Justice				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:At 7th level, a paladin gains Bash as a bonus feat and can use it with slashing or piercing weapons.
Code of Conduct			KEY:Paladin ~ Code of Conduct				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:A paladin must be of good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use her help for evil ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.
Associates				KEY:Paladin ~ Associates				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Paladin Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.79	DESC:While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers or cohorts who are of good alignment.

###Block: Rogue
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Rogue ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.80	DESC:Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus hand cross-bows, saps, short-bows, short swords and warblades. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.
Backstab				KEY:Rogue ~ Backstab					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:The rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied its Agility bonus to AC (whether the target actually has an Agility bonus or not) or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every 2 rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a backstab, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as backstabs only if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a backstab that deals non-lethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal non-lethal damage in a backstab, not even with the usual -4 penalty. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to backstabs. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot backstab while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
Trapfinding				KEY:Rogue ~ Trapfinding					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a DC higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of at least 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.
Evasion				KEY:Rogue ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Trap Sense				KEY:Rogue ~ Trap Sense					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level. Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Rogue ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Agility bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Agility bonus to AC if immobilized. If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Rogue ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.81	DESC:A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another rogue the ability to backstab the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Special Abilities			KEY:Rogue ~ Special Abilities				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:On attaining 3rd level, and at every three levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th and 18th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.
#
Crippling Strike			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Crippling Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:A rogue with this ability can backstab opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her backstabs also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day. The rogue may use this ability once per day for every three levels of rogue.
Finishing Strike			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Finishing Strike				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:As a full attack action, a rogue can make an attack against a target, and then follow up that attack with a deadly blow. This combination strike requires that the first melee attack hits the target successfully and does damage. The rogue may then make a second attack, which is rolled using the rogue's normal attack bonus. If the second attack hits, the attack also deals backstab damage to the enemy. The finishing strike must be declared before the first attack roll is made. This may only affect creatures normally susceptible to backstabs. A rogue may perform a finishing strike once per day, and gains an additional use per day at 10th, 15th and 20th level.
Improved Evasion			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Improved Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:This ability works like evasion, except that the rogue henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
Opportunist				KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Opportunist					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round. Skill Mastery: The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, he selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his Intellect modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, he may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills to master each time.
Spell Stopper			KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Spell Stopper				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	DESC:The rogue can attempt to interrupt a spell being cast by delivering a swift kick to the spellcaster in question. He must ready an action to interrupt a spell, or make an attack of opportunity against the spellcaster. While such an attack cannot deal backstab damage, the damage dealt is doubled for purposes of determining the DC of the spellcaster's Concentration check. The rogue may use this ability once per day for every three levels of rogue.
Sprint				KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Sprint					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:The rogue can move at a brisk pace, and still retain the ability to fight. A rogue with sprint adds +10 feet (2 squares) to his movement rate for every five levels of rogue the character possesses. The character may use sprint twice per day, and the ability lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to the character's Stamina modifier.
Stalk					KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Stalk						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:Remaining quiet and in hiding may be fine, but sometimes the rogue has to move and remain unseen. Stalking allows a rogue to travel past unaware sentries or other creatures. A rogue may use the stalk power a number of times per day equal to half his level. This ability has the same effects as invisibility with the following exceptions. The rogue must make a Stealth check with a DC equal to (10 + character level or Hit Dice + Spirit modifier + Intellect modifier) of any creature or person he stalks within 5 feet of in order to maintain his unseen presence. A rogue may stalk for as long as he wants, but he may not move faster than 10 feet per round while doing so. If the rogue moves faster than 10 feet or takes any action other than a free action while stalking, the rogue becomes visible. Rogues may not begin stalking while anyone within 30 feet is directly observing them.
Feat					KEY:Rogue Special Abilities ~ Feat						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Rogue Special Abilities.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:A rogue may gain a feat in place of a special ability.

###Block: Scout

Wild Healing			KEY:Scout ~ Wild Healing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	DESC:At 2nd level, a scout with 5 ranks in Survival can use natural materials found in the wilderness to heal wounds. The scout makes a DC 15 Survival check representing 1 hour of searching for and preparing roots, rare leaves, berries and other such materials for a natural brew or poultice. Once the subject ingests or applies the concoction (as appropriate), the scout makes a DC 10 Heal check. The subject recovers 1 hit point for every point by which the result exceeds 10. Wild healing affects a single subject per attempt, and the same subject benefits from the concoction only once per day. In addition, the scout gains a +5 compe-tence bonus on the Heal check at 6th level. This bonus applies only to Heal checks made for wild healing, and increases by +5 for every four scout levels thereafter (+10 at 10th level, +15 at 14th level, +20 at 18th level).
Woodland Stride			KEY:Scout ~ Woodland Stride				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 3rd level, a scout may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her, however.
Trackless Step			KEY:Scout ~ Trackless Step				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 4th level, a scout leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
Uncanny Dodge			KEY:Scout ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a scout retains her Agility bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. She still loses her Agility bonus to AC if helpless, however. If a scout already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a scout with at least two levels of barbarian, for example), she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead (see below).
Trap Sense				KEY:Scout ~ Trap Sense					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 5th level, a scout gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. This bonus increases by +1 for every three scout levels thereafter (+2 at 8th, +3 at 11th, +4 at 14th, +5 at 17th and +6 at 20th).
Locate Object			KEY:Scout ~ Locate Object				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:At 6th level, the scout can cast locate object once per day as a spell-like ability, as if she were a divine spellcaster of her class level.
Improved Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Scout ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Starting at 7th level, the scout can no longer be flanked; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies a rogue the ability to backstab the scout by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has scout levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
Swift Tracker			KEY:Scout ~ Swift Tracker				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.84	DESC:Beginning at 8th level, a scout can move at her normal speed while following tracks without taking the standard -5 penalty.

Evasion				KEY:Scout ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:At 12th level, a scout can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a burning hands spell), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the scout is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless scout (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Commune with Nature		KEY:Scout ~ Commune with Nature			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Scout Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.85	DESC:At 13th level, a scout can cast commune with nature once per day as a spelllike ability, as if she were a divine spellcaster of her class level.

Bonus Feats				KEY:Tinker ~ Bonus Feats				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:A tinker begins play with a bonus feat in addition to the feat received by all 1st-level characters. This feat must be a technology feat (see Chapter 6: Feats), or it may be an Exotic Weapon Proficiency that allows the tinker to wield a technological weapon (with the exception of firearms). The tinker also receives a bonus feat at 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th and 20th). A tinker must meet all prerequisites for his bonus feats.
Packrat				KEY:Tinker ~ Packrat					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.86	DESC:Tinkers tend to carry about packs and pouches full of heavy tools, spare parts and inventions both finished and incomplete. In doing so, they quickly develop the ability to shoulder casually otherwise crushing burdens. A tinker of 2nd level or higher calculates his carrying capacity as if he possessed 5 bonus points of Strength.
Scavenge				KEY:Tinker ~ Scavenge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:A tinker of 2nd level or higher can put together devices out of random piles of spare parts or whatever wires and gears he happens to be carrying in his pockets at the time. A tinker who succeeds at a Search check with a DC equal to 15 + the intended device's overall Technology Score (TS) can gather random materials sufficient to substitute for raw materials equal to half the tinker's level x 50 gp.
Cobble				KEY:Tinker ~ Cobble					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:Tinkers prefer to spend days, weeks or even months constructing the devices they design. When adventuring, though, tinkers are often forced to throw together a device more quickly. A tinker of 3rd level or higher can make Craft (technological device) checks for progress on a device's construction once per hour, rather than the normal once per week (see Chapter 11 on the device construction process). However, after the device is complete, the device's Malfunction Rating is increased by +5. Further, it will continue to increase by +1 each time the device is operated, and no repair or upgrade can decrease it. At 3rd level, the tinker may use the cobble ability once per week. Each five levels thereafter (8th, 13th and 18th), the tinker may use the ability one additional time, to a maximum of four times at 18th level.
Bomb Bouncing			KEY:Tinker ~ Bomb Bouncing				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 4th level, a tinker learns an esoteric technique developed by mad goblin tinkers and passed along to their brethren - the art of bomb throwing. When throwing a grenade-like weapon, a tinker with the bomb bouncing ability imparts a spin to the object that doubles the thrown object's range increment.
Evasion				KEY:Tinker ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:Beginning at 4th level, a tinker gains the evasion ability and can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a tinker with the evasion ability makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a burning hands spell or an exploding phlogiston boiler), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the tinker is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless tinker (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
Coolness Under Fire		KEY:Tinker ~ Coolness Under Fire			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.87	DESC:At 5th level, a tinker has employed his skills in dangerous situations often enough that he learns how to remain calm in combat even when operating complex controls or working to repair delicate machinery. Once per day, the tinker can take 10 on any roll that involves the construction, operation or repair of a technological device, even when circumstances would otherwise prevent it. This ability cannot be used for attack rolls, so the tinker cannot take 10 when operating a weapon such as a blunderbuss or a steam saw. For each two tinker levels achieved beyond 5th level, a tinker can use the coolness under fire ability one additional time per day, to a maximum of eight times per day at 19th level.
Energy Resistance			KEY:Tinker ~ Energy Resistance			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:Tinkers are exposed to raw and powerful energies in the course of their work, and often develop a degree of resistance to one kind or another. Upon reaching 6th level, a tinker may select a single type of energy - acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic - and gain 5 points of resistance to that type of energy. Whenever the tinker would take damage of that energy type (whether from a natural or magical source), the damage is reduced by 5 points before being applied to the tinker's hit points. At 12th level, 16th level and 20th level, the tinker gains an additional 5 points of energy resistance. This resistance may be of the same type, or spread across multiple energy types. As it is not a supernatural or spell-like ability, a tinker's energy resistance stacks with resistance gained from spells such as protection from energy and resist energy.
Improved Evasion			KEY:Tinker ~ Improved Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Tinker Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:At 14th level, a tinker's evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a burning hands spell or exploding device, but henceforth he takes only half damage even on a failed save. As always, a helpless tinker (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

###Block: Warrior
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Warrior ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:A warrior is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium and light) and shields (including tower shields).
Bonus Feats				KEY:Warrior ~ Bonus Feats					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warrior Class Feature.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.88	DESC:At 1st level, a warrior gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets (and the bonus feat granted to a human character). The warrior gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two warrior levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as warrior bonus feats (see Chapter 6: Feats). A warrior must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets when advancing levels. A warrior is not limited to the list of warrior bonus feats when choosing feats earned by advancing in level.
