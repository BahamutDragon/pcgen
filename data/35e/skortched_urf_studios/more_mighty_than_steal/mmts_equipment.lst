Ink of Summoning					TYPE:Gear.Writing Equipment			SOURCEPAGE:p.2	SPROP:Ink of Summoning is a powerful substance that can be used to call a specific creature to you. Write the name of a specific creature along with any titles onto a page with Ink of Summoning, then burn the page. As the page is consumed the creature whose name appears on the page is called before you on a failed Will save (DC 19). If you are not specific enough in your naming, the Ink can summon the wrong person or even no one at all (DM's discretion). This magic of the Ink of Summoning only functions on the same plane of existence as the subject. If you use the subject's true name then no Will save is allowed. A creature called by the ink is not under your control. A vial of Ink of Summoning contains enough ink for only one use. Moderate conjuration; CL 9th	COST:2400
