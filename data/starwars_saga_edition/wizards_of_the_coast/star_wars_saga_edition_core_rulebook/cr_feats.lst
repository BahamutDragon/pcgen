Bantha Rush				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Soldier																																											PRESTAT:1,STR=13												DESC:You can shove your opponents around the battlefield to gain a tactical advantage.																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.82				BENEFIT: After making a successful melee attack against an opponent up to one size category larger than you, you can choose to move that opponent 1 square in any direction as a free action.

Burst Fire				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.AttackOption															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Heavy Weapons Proficiency																																				DESC:Take a -5 penalty on an autofire attack to gain +2 dice damage.	DESC:When using a ranged weapon in autofire mode, you can fire a short burst at a single foe.																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.82				BENEFIT: When using a ranged weapon with autofire capability in autofire mode, you may fire a short burst as a single attack against a single target. You take a -5 penalty on the attack roll but deal +2 dice of damage. For example, a weapon that deals 3dlO points of damage deals Sd10 points of damage instead. The effects of this feat do not stack with the extra damage provided by the Deadeye or Rapid Shot feat. Special: Firing a burst expends five shots and can only be done if the weapon has at least five shots remaining. Normal: Autofire uses ten shots, targets a 2-square-bY-2-square area, and can't be aimed at a specific target. Without this feat, if you attempt an autofire attack at a specific target, it simply counts as a normal attack and all the extra shots are wasted. If you do not have a Strength of 13 or higher, increase the penalty on attacks to -10 when using this feat with non-vehicle weapons.
Careful Shot			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Scout.Soldier															PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Point Blank Shot																																					DESC:You are particularly skilled at aiming your attacks.

Charging Fire			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Soldier																																																									DESC:You are able to make ranged attacks while charging.																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.82				BENEFIT: When you charge, you may make a ranged attack instead of a melee attack at the end of your movement. Unlike a normal charge, your momentum does not help overcome your target, so you gain no bonus on attack roll. As with a normal charge, you still take a -2 penalty to your Reflex Defense. Normal: You can make a single melee attack with a +2 bonus, on your attack roll at the end of a charge.																																																																																														PRETOTALAB:4
Cleave				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.Jedi.Soldier.AttackOption													PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack																								PRESTAT:1,STR=13												DESC:You can follow through with a powerful melee attack.																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.83				BENEFIT: If you deal an opponent enough damage to reduce its hit points to 0, you get an immediate extra melee attack against another opponent within your reach.
