SOURCELONG:Babylon 5	SOURCESHORT:B5
# Entry Date: June 6, 2012


Ability Focus (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have honed your telepathic talent and can now use
telepathic abilities of a particular Discipline as if they were
second nature to you.
Benefit: Choose a single telepathic Discipline. You now gain
a +2 competence bonus to all Telepathy checks made when
using abilities in this Discipline.
Special: This feat may be selected multiple times. Its effects
do not stack - instead, a new telepathic Discipline is selected
each time.

Adaptive Mind (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Having spent much time with alien races and their strange
minds no longer hold any fear for you. Your telepathic
abilities now have as much an effect upon them as they do
members of your own species.
Prerequisite: Telepathy 6 ranks.
Benefit: You suffer no penalty for using telepathic abilities on
races other than your own.
Normal: Telepathy checks normally face a -4 penalty when
used on members of a different race to the telepath.

Alertness	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are quick to notice and react to unexpected events.
Prerequisite: Improved Initiative.
Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus to all Notice checks and may
retain your Dexterity bonus to Defence, even when flatfooted.
You still count as being flat-footed, however, for the
purposes of Opportunity effects and other rules that are only
ative when you are flat-footed.
Normal: Flat-footed characters lose their Dexterity bonus to
Defence Value.

Alien Anatomy	CATEGORY:FEAT
Having made a detailed study of many different species from
all over the galaxy, your medical knowledge now extends to
alien biologies.
Prerequisite: Medical 6 ranks.
Benefit: You reduce the penalty for making Medical checks
on alien species by 2. If you have 6 ranks in Knowledge
(specific culture), you no longer suffer a penalty at all with
the specified race.
Normal: Characters attempting to use the Medical skill on
a species alien to their own normally suffer a -4 penalty (or a
-2 penalty if they have 4 ranks in Knowledge (specific culture
)).

Alien Empathy	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have dealt with many types of alien on a social and
professional level and that has broadened your understanding
of communicating with and understanding these other races.
Prerequisite: Sense Motive 6 ranks.
Benefit: You reduce the penalty for making Sense Motive
checks on alien species by 2. If you have 4 ranks in Knowledge
(specific culture), you no longer suffer a penalty at all with the
specified race.
Normal: Characters attempting to use the Sense Motive skill
on a species alien to their own normally suffer a -4 penalty
(or a -2 penalty if they have 4 ranks in Knowledge (specific
culture)).
Armour Familiarity	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are used to wearing restrictive clothing and armour, such
as spacesuits, and such outfits do not hinder you as much as
others.
Benefit: You decrease armour check penalty of any armour,
such as a pressure suit, by 2. Note that this also makes it
quicker to don armour. An armour check penalty due to
other circumstances (such as a Drazi with Dense Scales) is not
affected by this feat.
Normal: Characters suffer a stiff armour check penalty to
Acrobatics, Athletics, Drive, Pilot and Stealth checks.
Bimitha Adept (Abbai)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are an adept in the Abbai martial art of Bimitha,
which enhances your racial predilection for personal
defence.
Prerequisite: Wisdom 13.
Benefit: You receive a +2 bonus
(rather than +1 bonus) when
fighting defensively or engaging in total defence. Also, you
no longer suffer the Abbai racial -2 penalty to Initiative.
Normal: Abbai receive only a +1 bonus when fighting
defensively or engaging in total defence and suffer a -2
penalty to Initiative.
Blind-Fight	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are adept at fighting in the darkness.
Benefit: In close combat, every time the character misses
because of concealment, the character can re-roll the miss
chance roll one time to see if the character actually hits. The
character also takes only half the usual penalty to speed for
being unable to see. Darkness and poor visibility in general
reduces the character's speed to three-quarters of normal,
instead of one-half.
Blood Oath (Narn)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Narn believe they have a keen sense of justice and when an
individual or his family is wronged, they often take the Chon-
Kar - the Blood Oath. This vow is normally taken for the
most heinous of crimes, such as murder or treason, and once
committed to the Chon-Kar, a Narn will do everything in
his power to track down and kill the people responsible for
the injustice. This is perfectly legal in Narn society, though
other races often have laws that may cause the fulfilment of
the Blood Oath itself illegal, in their eyes at least.
Prerequisite: Must have suffered a great injustice.
Benefit: Those that take this feat will feel their blood boil
and anger rise whenever the target of the Blood Oath is close
by. Upon selecting this feat, you must choose a particular
individual or small group who has wronged you, your family
or your race. When involved in combat with this individual,
you will receive a +2 morale bonus to all
attack and damage rolls. As soon as the individual has been killed or otherwise brought to justice,
the Blood Oath is fulfilled. However, the Narn may declare
a new Blood Oath against a new target, as long as that target
has also committed a great injustice.
Special: You may select this feat multiple times, with each
allowing you to select an additional target for the Chon-Kar.
Blood Rage (Narn)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Few Narn are noted for their patience or temperance but some
have been known to fly into berserk rages while engaging in
combat. Racing at the enemy, they are heedless of their own
lives and as their blood boils within their veins, they gain
almost supernatural strength that allows them to overcome
any enemy.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: When in any dangerous or life-threatening situation,
you can fly into a berserk rage as a free action, gaining
phenomenal strength and endurance. Once per day, you can
enter the Blood Rage. You immediately gain a temporary
+4 bonus to Strength and Constitution and a temporary +2
morale bonus to Will saves. The Constitution bonus will
increase your hit points by +2. However, you also become far
more reckless and so suffer a temporary -2 penalty to Defence
Value. The Blood Rage lasts for a number of rounds equal
to 3 + your (newly improved) Constitution modifier. At the
end of the Blood Rage, you lose all temporary bonuses and
penalties. In addition, you will be fatigued.
Brawler	CATEGORY:FEAT
You can hold your own in a bar-fight or brawl.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: You are considered to be armed even when unarmed
- that is, you do not provoke attacks or opportunity from
armed opponents when you attack them while unarmed.
However, you still get an attack of opportunity against any
opponent who makes an unarmed attack on you. In addition,
your unarmed strikes can deal lethal or nonlethal damage,
at your option. You also gain a +2 bonus to bull rush and
grapple checks.
Normal: A character without the Brawler or Martial Arts feats
provokes attacks of opportunity when attacking unarmed and
can only deal nonlethal damage.
Combat Expertise	CATEGORY:FEAT
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: When the character uses the attack action or the
full attack action in personal combat, the character can take
a penalty of up to -5 on his attack rolls and add the same
number (up to +5) as a dodge bonus to his Defence Value.
This number may not exceed the character's base attack
bonus. The changes to attack rolls and Defence Value last
until the character's next action.
Normal: A character without the Combat Expertise feat can
fight defensively to take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and gain
a +2 dodge bonus to Defence.
Combat Telepath (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are used to using your telepathic talent in situations of
intense danger and pressure. Even while shells and blasts fly
past or while engaged in vicious hand-to-hand combat, your
mind remains clear and unsullied, prepared to implement
your telepathic abilities at any time.
Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus to all Concentration checks
made to use and maintain telepathic abilities while in
combat.
Contact	CATEGORY:FEAT
You know the value of friends and favours and have cultivated
one particular relationship in order to provide you with great
benefits.
Benefit: You gain one contact, as described in the rules for
Influence (see page 35).
Special: This feat may be selected multiple times. Its effects
do not stack but instead a new contact is gained each time the
feat is taken.
Data Access	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are trained to access and comprehend huge amounts of
data very rapidly. You have an almost inhuman ability to
locate and analyse the information you search for.
Prerequisites: Wisdom 13, Computer Use 4 ranks.
Benefit: When using your Computer Use skill, the time
required for any action is halved. You may also reduce the
DC of checks to find files by 5.

Dense Scales (Drazi)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Some Drazi are born with abnormally thick scales that
continue to develop and harden as adulthood is reached.
They limit mobility but can provide a much greater level of
protection.
Prerequisite: This feat must be selected at 1st character level.
Benefit: The natural Damage Reduction of your scales is
increased to 2. However, you gain a natural armour check
penalty of -1, which stacks with the armour check penalty of
any armour worn.
Normal: Drazi normally gain natural Damage Reduction 1
from their scales.
Devoted Friend	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have strong ties to a friend or relative and have already
experienced hardship or adventure together - above all
else, this is the one person you can always rely upon during
adversity.
Prerequisite: At least one contact.
Benefit: Your devoted friend is one of your contacts (pick
one). Your devoted friend has 10 points of Influence in their
field (rather than 6) and can give the character a +4 bonus to
Influence checks made within their field of Influence (rather
than +2). Also, unlike a regular contact, a devoted friend
will physically interpose themselves between the character
and mortal danger. It takes a tremendous amount to cause a
devoted friend to betray you. Note that on occasion, however,
the devoted friend will also ask favours of the character and
expect them to be fulfilled.
Normal: A contact only has 6 points of Influence in their
field, can only give the character a +2 bonus to Influence
checks and will not risk themselves for the character.
Die Hard	CATEGORY:FEAT
Unusually resilient, you refuse to accept the inevitable and
can cling on to life long after others would have simply given
up.
Prerequisites: Endurance, Toughness.
Benefit: You automatically stabilise when reduced to -1 to
-9 hit points and gain a +4 bonus to the Fortitude save to
recover from such terrible injuries.
Normal: You have only a percentage chance of stabilising
when reduced to -1 to -9 hit points.
Dodge	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are especially good at avoiding attacks,
as long as you are not caught flatfooted
or unaware.
Prerequisite: Dexterity 13.
Benefit: You gain a +1 dodge bonus to Defence Value. This
Defence Value bonus applies only to personal combat.
Dogfighter	CATEGORY:FEAT
Your advanced spacecraft skills enable you to easily set up and
avoid targeting runs.
Prerequisites: Pilot 6 ranks, Spacecraft Proficiency.
Benefit: When executing a Targeting Run! order, you receive
a +4 competence bonus on the Pilot check. You also receive
this bonus when making an opposed Pilot check to resist a
Targeting Run! or perform an He's In Your Six! or Pivot! order.
Special: This feat only applies when the character is piloting
a solo space/aircraft.
Drazi Tackle	CATEGORY:FEAT
Named because it exemplifies a typical Drazi approach to
unarmed combat, those skilled in tackling others can often
treat targets as little more than bowling pins.
Prerequisites: Athletics 6 ranks, Brawler.
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus to bull rush checks. You do not
provoke an attack of opportunity when you try to bull rush
an opponent. Bull rush targets may not choose to avoid the
character. Also, if the attacker exceeds the target's Strength
check by 5 or more, he may choose to either:
G Push the target to one side (the target is moved to
the 5-foot by 5-foot space either to the left or right of
their current position and the attacker continues in the
direction of the bull rush as normal).
G Knocking the target down and move over them (the
target becomes prone automatically and the attacker
continues in the direction of the bull rush as normal).
G Knock the target backwards and stay in the target's
original space (the target will still move 5 feet in the
direction of the bull rush for every 5 points by which
the attacker' Strength check exceeded the target's).
Normal: Successful bull rushes can only knock the target
backwards and the attacker must move with the target for the
knockback distance to be greater than one 5-foot by 5-foot
space.
Elite Commander	CATEGORY:FEAT
Your skills and instincts for commanding flying craft are
virtually unparalleled.
Prerequisites: 9th character level, Spacecraft Proficiency,
Veteran Commander.
Benefit: You may issue four orders each turn when you are
in command of a space/aircraft (but not solo space/aircraft).
You also gain a +2 competence bonus to Knowledge (tactics)
checks (superseding the +1 bonus for Veteran Commander).
If you are in command of a craft nominated to be the flagship
of a fleet, craft executing the Join Fleet! order to join your fleet
automatically succeed in their Operations (piloting) checks
to do so.
Elite GROPOS	CATEGORY:FEAT
Your skills and instincts for commanding surface vehicles are
virtually unparalleled.
Prerequisites: 9th character level, Surface Vehicle Proficiency,
Veteran GROPOS.	CATEGORY:FEAT
Benefit: You may issue four orders each turn when you are in
command of a surface vehicle. You also gain a +2 competence
bonus to Knowledge (tactics) checks (superseding the +1
bonus for Veteran GROPOS).
If you are in command of a surface vehicle nominated to be
the lead vehicle of a battle group or battalion, craft executing
the Join Battle Group! or Join Battalion! orders to join you
automatically succeed in their Drive or Operations (driving)
checks to do so.
Elite Pilot	CATEGORY:FEAT
Your skills and instincts for piloting small air and space craft
are virtually unparalleled.
Prerequisites: 9th character level, Spacecraft Proficiency,
Veteran Pilot.	CATEGORY:FEAT
Benefit: You may issue four orders each turn when you are
in command of a solo space/aircraft. You also gain a +2
competence bonus to Knowledge (tactics) checks (superseding
the +1 bonus for Veteran Pilot).
If you are in command of a solo craft nominated to be the
wing commander of a wing, solo craft executing the Join
Wing! order to join your wing automatically succeed in their
Pilot checks to do so.
Endurance	CATEGORY:FEAT
You can withstand pain and hardship.
Benefit: The character gains a +4 bonus on the following
checks and saves: Athletics checks to increase a character's
hourly mileage when hiking, hourly Athletics checks to avoid
becoming fatigued when swimming, Constitution checks to
hold the character's breath or resist suffocation/drowning,
Constitution checks to avoid damage from starvation or
thirst, Fortitude saves to avoid damage from hot or cold
environments and Will saves to resist torture and pain. They
increase the number of hours they may hike by four.
Enhanced Speed (Minbari)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Like many of your race, you are exceptionally quick and have
an athletic physiology.
Benefit: Your base speed is increased to 40 feet. This also
gives you a +4 bonus to most Athletics checks made for
jumping.
Evasive Action	CATEGORY:FEAT
Having trained long and hard in spacecraft manoeuvres, you
can make it very difficult for an enemy to find the optimum
position from which to attack you.
Prerequisites: Pilot 6 ranks, Spacecraft Proficiency.
Benefit: You gain a +4 competence bonus on Pilot checks
when executing the Defensive Position or Extreme Measures!
orders.
Special: This feat only applies when the character is piloting
a solo space/aircraft.
Eye for Quality (Brakiri)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You can see the true value in most objects, and can readily
tell a good deal from a bad one through nothing more than
instinct and long experience.
Prerequisite: Skill Focus (Appraise).
Benefit: Appraise checks may usually be made in just one full
round action. If the item you are examining is disguised in
some way, it may take five rounds to get a feel for its apparent
value. Even if you fail a Appraise check, you will accurately guess the item's value to between 80% to 120% of its actual
value.
Normal: Appraise checks normally take one minute to make
and failure estimates the value to between 50% to 150% of
its actual value.
Exotic Weapon Proficiency	CATEGORY:FEAT
The character can wield a rare weapon, one which few can
master, such as the Minbari denn'bok.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: Choose one exotic weapon. You may use that weapon
without penalty.
Normal: If a character attempts to use a weapon he is not
proficient in, he suffers a -4 penalty to all attack rolls.
Family Ka'Toc (Narn)	CATEGORY:FEAT
As someone skilled in its use, you have inherited your family's
ka'toc. With this honour comes a dire responsibility to keep
disgrace from ever tainting the blade in its service to all
Narn.
Prerequisite: Weapon Focus (ka'toc).
Benefit: You receive a ka'toc and the legacy of tradition that
comes with it. When wielding this particular ka'toc, you gain
a +2 bonus to damage rolls, a +2 bonus to attack rolls to resist
being disarmed and a +1 morale bonus to Will saves. If the
blade is ever lost, you must struggle tirelessly to recover it or
face the greatest dishonour in the eyes of fellow Narn. If the
ka'toc is destroyed, this feat is lost and replaced by a Blood
Oath against the individual responsible. Once the Chon-Kar
is satisfied, you may either select a new target for the Blood
Oath or regain this feat by buying or forging a new ka'toc.
Far Shot	CATEGORY:FEAT
You can hit distant targets easily.
Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot.
Benefit: When the character uses a personal ranged weapon,
each range increment beyond the first only applies a -1
penalty to the attack roll.
Fire Control	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have learnt how to fire weapons from craft effectively and
can easily compensate for the often great speeds involved.
Prerequisites: Operations (gunnery) 4 ranks and Operations
(sensors) 4 ranks.
Benefit: You gain a +4 competence bonus to any Operations
(sensors) checks to perform the Lock Weapons order and to
hold on to a lock (if the target executes a Shake The Lock!
order).
Special: You may only apply this feat when the character is
in a space/aircraft if you also have the Spacecraft Proficiency
feat.
You may only apply this feat when the character is in a surface
vehicle if you also have the Surface Vehicle Proficiency feat.
Fluency	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have learnt how to speak another language fluently.
Benefit: You need not make Linguistics checks to
communicate with other speakers of the language. Note that
you may still have trouble with some concepts or words and
native speakers will still be able to detect that you are not a
native, (unless you succeed at a Linguistics check opposed by
their Sense Motive check).
You gain a +2 bonus to any Knowledge (specific culture)
checks for cultures whose language you speak. All races are
fluent in their starting languages and therefore receive this +2
bonus for Knowledge checks relating to their own culture and
any other whose language they are fluent in.
Special: You may only apply the +2 bonus to Knowledge
(Minbari) checks concerned with the caste whose language
you can speak.
The Minbari religious caste language of Adrenato and the
Centauri tongue are especially well suited to equivocation;
characters fluent in those languages gain a +4 circumstance
bonus when using them to send a secret message with the
Bluff skill.
Some languages can only bespoken by their native race.
Becoming fluent in these languages only allows comprehension
and possibly writing (if the language possesses a written
form). Examples of languages that can be understood but
not spoken by most races are Pak'ma'ra and Gaim. These two
races also suffer in that they cannot speak
languages other than their native tongue. These races must normally use translators in order to
be understood by aliens.
Fluency in Abbai includes fluency in the underwater language,
Burai. This language can only pronounced by Abbai and only
when the speakers and listener are underwater.
Gestalt (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have learnt how to draw upon the psychic reserves of
other telepaths, feeding their strength into your own abilities
to form an unstoppable wave of mental force.
Prerequisite: P5.
Benefit: You may draw upon the mental energies of any
willing telepath (those with a P-Rating of 1 or higher) as a
free action that is holding hands with you (forming a chain or
circle as necessary).
Only you need possess the Gestalt feat, it is not necessary for
the other telepaths to have it. Those telepaths aiding you
must succeed on a DC 10 Telepathy check and spend a full
round action doing so. For every telepath willingly aiding
you, you may add +1 to the DC of any Will save required to
resist telepathic ability you use.
In addition, you and every other member of the Gestalt gain
a +1 morale bonus per member (including yourself ) on Will
saves.
Normal: Telepaths may not aid each other with their telepathic
abilities.
Greater Gestalt (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Your ability to access other telepath's reserves of power is
nearly limitless.
Prerequisites: P10, Gestalt.
Benefit: As Gestalt, except for willing telepaths need only be
within 10 feet of yourself in order to aid you. Any telepath
involved in the Greater Gestalt may choose to offset some or
all telepathic damage they suffer onto one or more of other
telepaths.
Normal: Telepaths may not aid each other with their telepathic
abilities. Telepaths with Gestalt must be holding hands for it
to succeed and may not shunt telepathic damage.
Great Fortitude	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are physically healthy and tough.
Benefit: The character gets a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving
throws.
Harm's Way	CATEGORY:FEAT
Ever alert, you have dedicated your life to the preservation
of others and find it impossible to stand idle when danger
threatens the innocent.
Prerequisites: Alertness, Improved Initiative.
Benefit: You can physically interpose yourself between
another character and any incoming attacks. You must be
within 5 feet of the targeted character to do this and readied
in anticipation of the incoming attack. Your readied action
interrupts the attack and automatically causes the attack to be
made against yourself, rather than the intended target.
Hobby	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have developed a hobby outside your normal career
path.
Benefit: You may select any one skill. From this point on,
that skill will always be regarded as a class skill, no matter
which character class(es) you advance in.
Special: You may select this feat a number of times. Each
time this feat is selected, a new cross-class skill is chosen.
Improved Critical	CATEGORY:FEAT
Choose one type of weapon. You are especially lethal when
using that weapon.
Prerequisites: Weapon Focus (specific weapon), base attack
bonus +8.
Benefit: When using the weapon you selected, your threat
range is doubled.
For Example: A knife normally has a threat range of 19-20.
This means that any attack roll where the d20 comes up as a 19
or 20 is a threat - a possible critical hit. If you have Weapon
Focus (knife), the knife's threat ranged is doubled. This makes its
new threat range 17-20 - any attack roll where the d20 comes
up as a 17, 18, 19 or 20 is a threat.
Special: You can gain Improved Critical multiple times. The
effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to
a new type of weapon.
Improved Feint	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are an expert at feinting in combat.
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1, Combat Expertise.
Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus to all checks made to attempt or
resist feinting in combat. You may also feint as a move action
rather than an attack action.

Improved Fire Control	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are an expert at firing mounted weapons and maintaining
a lock.
Prerequisites: Operations (gunnery) 8 ranks and Operations
(sensors) 8 ranks, Fire Control
Benefit: You gain a +8 competence bonus to any Operations
(sensors) checks to perform the Lock Weapons order and to
hold on to a lock (if the target executes a Shake The Lock!
order). Note that this bonus replaces the +4 competence
bonus of Fire Control.
Special: You may only apply this feat when the character is
in a space/aircraft if you also have the Spacecraft Proficiency
feat.
You may only apply this feat when the character is in a surface
vehicle if you also have the Surface Vehicle Proficiency feat.

You are especially quick to react to dangerous situations.
Benefit: The character gains a +4 bonus on Initiative checks.
Improved Two-Weapon Fighting

Weapon Fighting, .
Benefit: The character gets a second attack with his offhand
weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.
Normal: Without this feat, a character can only get a single
extra attack with an off-hand weapon.
Independently Wealthy	CATEGORY:FEAT
Having come from a wealthy family or due to a successful
entrepreneurial enterprise, you have accumulated a great deal
of independent income.
Benefit: You immediately gain 1,000 credits. In addition,
you gain a regular income of 1,000 credits at the end of every
month.
Special: You must have the Games Master's permission to
select this feat.
You may select this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.
Inspirational Combatant	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have fought in firefights on innumerable
occasions and your calm demeanour is an example
to others.
Prerequisite: Nerves of Steel.
Benefit: Those with at least one
level of soldier, Ranger or officer can also ignore suppression
rules if they are within line of sight of you.
Iron Will	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are mentally resilient and stubbornly resist attempts to
sway you.
Benefit: The character gets a +2 bonus on all Will saving
throws.
Latent Telepath	CATEGORY:FEAT
While not a true telepath in the true sense, you have an
expanded consciousness that acts almost like a sixth sense.
Prerequisite: This feat must be selected at 1st character level.
Benefit: You have an effective P-Rating of 0 and are not
considered a true mundane. While you cannot actively use
any telepathic abilities, you will know instantly when someone
is attempting to use an ability on you.
In addition, you may use an extremely weak version of the
surface scan ability that detects the rough emotions of a single
person within 10 feet. This requires a full round action and a
Concentration check (DC 16).
Legendary Commander	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are a legend in your own time, rivalling the commanding
genius of such notables as John Sheridan.
Prerequisites: 13th character level, Spacecraft Proficiency,
Elite Commander, Veteran Commander.

of a fleet, craft executing the Join Fleet! order to join your fleet

to do so.
If you are in command of a craft nominated as the flagship of
a fleet, all craft (including your own) within the fleet gain a
+1 morale bonus to attack rolls and skill checks (a +1 morale
bonus to BAB and Training).
Legendary GROPOS	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are a legend in your own time, rivalling the commanding
genius of such notables as General
Franklin.
Prerequisites: 13th character level, Surface Vehicle Proficiency,
Elite GROPOS, Veteran GROPOS.
Benefit: You may issue five orders each turn when you are in
command of a surface vehicle. You also gain a +3 competence

Lightning Reflexes
You react remarkably quickly to changes in your
environment.
Benefit: The character gets a +2 bonus on all Reflex saving
throws.
Lightning Reload	CATEGORY:FEAT
Intense training and practice allow you to reload weapons at a
rapid rate, barely cutting into your firing time.
Benefit: You can reload any pistol or rifle weapon as a free
action, so long as the spare magazine or cap is immediately
at hand.

Liturgies of the Heart (Narn)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Your oratory skills, pure adherence to your convictions and
inspirational examples can touch the reverence of other Narn
deeply, strengthening their resolve in the times of greatest
hardship.
Prerequisites: Charisma 13, Priestly Devotion.
Benefit: As Priestly Devotion, except that every Narn who
can hear your words also gains the Priestly Devotion bonuses

You are trained in a particular school of martial artists, such
as tae kwon doe, karate or an alien style such as that used by
the Minbari.
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1.
Benefit: You are considered to be armed even when unarmed
- that is, you do not provoke attacks or opportunity from
armed opponents when you attack them while unarmed.
However, you still get an attack of opportunity against
any opponent who makes an unarmed attack on
you. In addition, your unarmed strikes can deal
lethal or nonlethal damage, at your option.
You also gain a +2 bonus to disarm
and trip checks.
Normal: A character without the Brawler or Martial Arts feats
provokes attacks of opportunity when attacking unarmed and
can only deal nonlethal damage.
Meditation (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
It is a little known fact that the slightest distraction can disrupt
a delicate telepathic talent. Many telepaths will therefore
spend time in any area where they expect to use their abilities,
feeling the acoustics and auras created by furnishings, walls
and technological devices. In doing so, they can vastly
improve the chances of success when employing their talent.
Prerequisite: Wisdom 13.
Benefit: By spending at least ten minutes meditating in
an area, which may not be larger than 30 feet by 30 feet,
the Telepath can more easily implement his telepathic
abilities. Meditation is therefore generally only used before
interrogations, ambushes, council meetings and other planned
encounters.
If the preparations are correctly made, then the telepath gains
a circumstance bonus to all Telepathy checks made within
that area for the next hour. This circumstance bonus is equal
to the telepath's Wisdom bonus.
Mental Fortress (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Channelling your mental defences into an all but impenetrable
shield, you are able to place a barrier between your mind and
telepathic abilities designed to injure or harm.
Prerequisite: P6.
Benefit: As long as your mind shield is active, you gain
Damage Reduction 2 against any telepathic damage caused by
another telepath interfering with your mind. This Damage
Reduction will not reduce damage caused by the telepath
exerting mental effort.
Normal: Telepathic damage ignores Damage Reduction.
Might Makes Right (Drazi)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have always believed that the strong have the natural right
to dominate the weak and refuse to succumb to adversity.
This grants you great surety of purpose.
Prerequisite: Constitution 13.
Benefit: Your utter refusal to succumb to weakness allows
you to carry on when others would otherwise fall. When
reduced to -1 to -9 hit points, you may automatically stay
conscious. You also gain a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks
made to demoralise opponents.

Mindshredder (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have been trained in advanced attack and disruption
methods, making you a perfect telepathic killer. With a single
thought, you can cripple an enemy.
Prerequisite: P8.
Benefit: Whenever you cause telepathic damage to another,
increase the damage by +2.
Natural Athlete	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have developed your athletic potential and find many
tasks easier as a result.
Prerequisite: Athletics 4 ranks.
Benefit: You do not become flat-footed when balancing
or climbing. You automatically succeed at Reflex saves to
catch onto edges when jumping and Athletics checks to drag
yourself up from dangling. You can also 'kip up' (stand up) as
a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Nerves of Steel	CATEGORY:FEAT
Utterly unshakeable in the midst of great danger, you can
remain calm at all times, focussing your energy and effort into
battling your enemies.
Benefit: You ignore the rules for being caught in suppression
during a firefight. You also gain a +1 competence bonus to
Concentration checks.
Noble Birth (Centauri)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Born into a good family, you have known little other than
privilege and responsibility in your life.
Prerequisite: This feat must be selected at 1st character level.
Benefit: You bear a minor noble rank - nothing fancy but
one that can certainly benefit you through life. Just being of
recognisable noble birth grants a +1 bonus to all Charismabased
checks made when dealing with other Centauri. In
addition, you gain 1d4 Influence (Centauri Royal Court).
Perfection of Toil (Minbari)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Your reverent attention to detail makes your work some of the
finest to be found in its field.
Prerequisites: Must be worker caste, Concentration 8 ranks,
Profession 13 ranks.
Benefit: Choose one Profession skill the Minbari has 13
ranks in. You may Take 20 when using this skill and it only
takes you ten times as long to do so.
Special: This feat may be selected multiple times. Its effects
do not stack but a new Profession skill may be selected each
time.
Point Blank Shot	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are skilled at hitting targets at close range.
Benefit: The character gets a +1 bonus on attack and damage
rolls with personal ranged weapons against opponents within
30 feet.
Precise Shot	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are able to focus your ranged attacks. As long as you can
see part of your target, you are likely to hit it.
Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6, Point Blank Shot.
Benefit: If you spend three consecutive full round actions
aiming (see page 170) with any personal ranged weapon, you
can ignore cover when using personal ranged weapons. Total
cover is still effective.
Normal: A target gains a +4 bonus to Defence Value if he has
cover relative to the attacker.
Prehensile Tentacles (Centauri)	CATEGORY:FEAT
A few male Centauri take the time and patience to learn how
to grasp small objects with their tentacle-like appendages.
This takes a great deal of practice to be of any practical use
beyond sexual activity but some Centauri find great value in
having additional manipulative organs.
Prerequisite: Must be male.
Benefit: By loosening your clothes, you can extend the two
primary tentacles from your torso, up to a range of 5 feet.
They can be used to grip or stick to small objects of up to
one pound in weight. Fine manipulation of the object (such
as pulling the trigger of a small weapon) is not possible but
you can, for example, flick switches or pull objects closer to
you. When using these tentacles, you gain a +2 bonus to
Subterfuge checks when using sleight of hand. You also gain a
+4 bonus to any checks during sex with a female Centauri.
Priestly Devotion (Narn)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have studied one of the books written by a renowned
Narn spiritual leader of the past and can readily find strength
in its words.

Knowledge (philosophy) 4 ranks.
Benefit: You can draw upon your faith to accomplish things
other Narn cannot. Once per day, you can recite a passage
from memory, learned during your religious studies, as
a standard action. For a number of rounds equal to your
Wisdom bonus, you gain a +2 morale bonus to Fortitude or
Will saving throws and any skill checks.

Resist Scan	CATEGORY:FEAT
While not a telepath yourself, you have spent many hours
practising to resist their scans and mental intrusions. By
running continuous rhymes through your head and
performing complex mathematical calculations, you can
effectively create a mental barrier that many telepaths will
have difficulty breaking through.
Prerequisites: May not have P-Rating of 1 or higher, Iron
Will.
Benefit: As a free action, you may concentrate to resist
telepathic abilities that target you. You receive a +2 competence
bonus to all Will saves made to resist telepathic abilities being
used upon you. Any Intelligence or Wisdom-based checks
suffer a -1 penalty while concentrating in this way.
Run	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are exceptionally fast and nimble when sprinting.
Benefit: When running, you move five times your normal
speed (if unencumbered) or four times your speed (if
encumbered). If you make a jump after a running
start (see the Athletics skill), you gain a +4 bonus
on your Athletics check. You are not flat-footed
while running.
Normal: You move four times your speed while running (or
three times when encumbered) and you are flat-footed.
Silent Tread (Minbari)	CATEGORY:FEAT
Through long years of meditative exercises, certain members
of the Minbari religious caste have developed the ability to
move with utter silence, making it almost impossible to detect
their approach.
Prerequisites: Must be religious caste, Concentration 4 ranks,
Stealth 4 ranks.
Benefit: So long as you move at one half of your base speed or
less and are unencumbered and not suffering from an armour
check penalty, you can move in virtual silence. You can Take
20 on Stealth checks for moving silently in these circumstances
(it takes no extra time for you to Take 20 in this case).
Sixth Sense	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have developed a sixth sense, feeling distinctly
uncomfortable as the hairs rise on the back of your neck
whenever someone takes aim at you or flanks you.
Prerequisite: Alertness, Improved Initiative.
Benefit: You know when someone is taking
aim at you, even if you cannot see your opponent. Note that this feat only lets you know when
someone is aiming at you and no information as to your
opponent's location or what weapon they are using may be
gained. Those taking aiming actions on you only receive half
their usual bonus (+1 to attack per aiming action rather than
+2). Opponents who flank you do not gain the usual +2
bonus to attack rolls.
Normal: You will not necessarily know when someone is
targeting you with aiming actions and they receive a +2 bonus
to attack rolls against you per consecutive aiming action.
Flanking opponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls that target
you.
Skill Focus	CATEGORY:FEAT
You are a master of a specific skill.
Benefit: Select one skill, such as Acrobatics, Knowledge
(biology) or Medical. You gain a +3 bonus to all checks made
with that skill. Telepathy may not be selected with Skill Focus
- instead, see the Ability Focus feat.

do not stack - instead, another skill is chosen each time.
Spacecraft Dodge	CATEGORY:FEAT

spacecraft. In addition, you no longer suffer a gravity penalty
to Dexterity in low, very low or microgravity (see page 289).
Normal: Non-proficient spacefarers suffer a -4 penalty to
most checks and rolls while in a spacecraft and may only issue
one order per turn if in command of a craft.
Stench (Pak'ma'ra)	CATEGORY:FEAT
You smell really, really, really bad - enough to throw those
around you off. Other Pak'ma'ra find this scent attractive,
however.
Prerequisite: This feat must be selected at 1st character level.
Benefit: Any character coming within ten feet of you must
make a Concentration check (DC 10 + your Constitution
modifier). If this Concentration check is failed, the character
suffers a -2 penalty to all skill checks and attack rolls this
round. Characters suffering from your stench may attempt
this check every round in order to overcome their nausea.
Pak'ma'ra need not make Concentration checks and you gain
a +1 bonus to all Charisma-based checks made when dealing
with Pak'ma'ra within ten feet.

command of a surface vehicle. When driving in poor visibility,
you reduce your vehicle's speed by 10#% rather than 25%%.
Normal: Non-proficient drivers and vehicle commanders may
only issue one order per turn if in command of a vehicle.
Synergist (Telepathy)	CATEGORY:FEAT
The telepathic talent is a difficult one to comprehend and
control and most gifted individuals may spend their entire
lives trying to master it. However, a tiny fraction of telepaths
seem born to wield their abilities with superlative skill and
can rapidly crush any defence their enemies try to mount by
blasting them with a rapid succession of attacks and thrusts.
Prerequisites: P5, Concentration 13 ranks, Telepathy 13
ranks.
Benefit: Attempting to initiate a telepathic ability while
retaining control of another increases the DC of the second
Telepathy check by +2 (rather than +4). Concentration
checks to maintain either ability have their DC increased by
+2 (rather than +4).
Normal: Normal telepaths attempting to initiate a telepathic
ability while retaining control of another increase the DC of
the second Telepathy check by +4. Concentration checks to
maintain either ability have their DC increased by +4.
Telepath	CATEGORY:FEAT
You have definite telepathic potential.
Prerequisite: This feat must be selected at 1st character level.

Two-Weapon Fighting	CATEGORY:FEAT
You can fight with a weapon in each hand. You can make one
extra attack each round with the second weapon.

Benefit: Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two
weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand
lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.
You can also draw two light weapons in the time it normally
takes to draw one. Also, this feat allows the character to use
a close combat weapon in one hand and a ranged weapon in
the other.
Normal: If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you
can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When
fighting in this way you suffer a -6 penalty with your regular
attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty
to the attack with your off-hand. If your off-hand weapon is
light the penalties are reduced by 2 each. Both weapons must
be of the same type (either both ranged weapons or both close
combat weapons).

the feat is taken, a new weapon is selected.

loss of the flagship warcruiser Dark Star to the Humans still a
stain on your people's honour.
