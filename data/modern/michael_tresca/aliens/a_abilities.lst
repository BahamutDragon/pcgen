#Aliens possess the following traits:
� Acid Blood (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:All Aliens, from facehugger to adult, have acidic blood. For any physical attack causing damage to an Alien, there is a chance for "splash damage" from the acid blood. Count only that damage which gets through damage reduction. Use the amount of damage done in the attack as the DC for the save of the melee weapon doing the damage modified as necessary if a masterwork or magical weapon. Use the amount of damage done in the attack as the DC for the Reflex saving throw for all those within 5 feet of the creature hit. Modify the DC and subsequent damage by 1/2 if using bludgeoning or piercing weapons. Double the DC and damage if the Alien is above the victim. Damage from acid splash is 1d6 per 6 points of damage inflicted by an attack causing a splash (round down) for a maximum of 10d6. Armor and possessions must be checked on a failure. Any item must make a save vs. the DC of the amount of damage inflicted. A masterwork weapon gets a bonus of +5 to the save. Failure destroys the item. Floor and surroundings must be checked as well for results of acid damage.																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Blindsight (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Using non-visual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, Aliens maneuver and fight as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though the Alien must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability's range extends to 60 feet. The Alien does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Blindsight is continuous, and the Alien need do nothing to use it.																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Invisibility (Ex)								KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Because Aliens do not generate body heat because they do not have any external cellular activity. They do not show up on thermal sensors.																																																																																																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Breath Weapon (Ex)								KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Adult Aliens (drones and praetorians) can spit acid three times a day. Such breath weapons allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing Alien's racial HD + breathing Alien's Con modifier). Failure to save also causes the target to be dazed for 1d4 rounds. Aliens are immune to their own breath weapon.																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.
#98
� Climb (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:All Aliens have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. The Alien must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 even if rushed or threatened while climbing. The Alien climbs at the given speed while climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb it moves at double the given climb speed (or its base land speed, whichever is lower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Aliens cannot run while climbing. An Alien retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a climbing Alien.																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Energy Resistance (Ex)							KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Aliens have cold resistance 5. Due to the conductive nature of their blood, they are also capable of being electrocuted. Aliens have electrical resistance 5.																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Fear Attraction (Ex)								KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Alien adults (drones and praetorians) that detect fear using their Sense Fear ability become excited. Fearful prey stimulates them to make especially messy kills. The Alien gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and -2 to Armor Class until its victim is no longer afraid (e.g., dead, flees the area, drives off the Alien, etc.). The Alien cannot end its rage voluntarily.																																																																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Frightful Presence (Ex)							KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:This special quality makes an Alien's very presence unsettling to foes. It takes effect automatically when the Alien performs some sort of dramatic action (such as charging, attacking, or snarling). Opponents within range who witness the action may become frightened. The range is 30 feet, and the duration is 5d6 rounds. This ability affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the Alien. An affected opponent can resist the effects with a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 frightful Alien's racial HD + frightful creature's Cha modifier). Increases the DC by 2 per additional Alien praetorian, worker, or Queen within 50 feet. If a chestburster emerges from a body, it can use its frightful presence power with a +5 circumstance penalty to the save. An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to that same Alien's frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Hive Mind (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:All Aliens within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No Alien in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Improved Grab (Ex)								KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:If an Alien hits with its tail, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. No initial touch attack is required. This ability works for any humanoid creature up to Large size (even in the case of facehuggers). The Alien has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tail to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a -20 penalty on grapple checks, but is not considered grappled itself; the Alien does not lose its Dexterity bonus to Defense, still threatens an area, and can use its remaining attacks against other opponents. A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the Alien also has the constrict special attack. If the Alien does not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well. When an Alien gets a hold after an improved grab attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can even move (possibly carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the opponent's weight.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Poison (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Any creature hit by a tail attack from an adult Alien must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d2 hours. The Fortitude save DC against a poison attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 Alien's racial HD + Alien's Con modifier. It can poison up to 18 times a day. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown. Aliens are immune to their own poison.

� Pounce (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:When an Alien makes a charge, it can follow with a full attack.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Psychic Vulnerability (Su)							KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Due to the subjugation of Aliens to their Queen, weakened Aliens can have their actions influenced by a mind in an exalted state (using psionics, for example). Aliens receive a -1 morale penalty to all Will saves against psionic F/X for every 8 hit points lost. If the Alien heals, these penalties disappear.																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Resin (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Alien adults (drones and praetorians) often wait in their hive and then lower themselves silently on silk strands to leap onto prey passing beneath. A single strand is strong enough to support the Alien and one creature of the same size. Aliens can release a strand eight times per day, even at opponents. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 20 feet, with a range increment of 5 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the Alien. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst it with a Strength check. Both are standard actions whose DCs are given in the table below. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. Attempts to escape or burst the cocoon gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has the hit points given on the table, and cocoons have damage reduction 5/fire. An adult Alien can move across its own resin at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching the resin. Resin blocks all transmissions and signals, including radio transmissions. Size Escape Artist DC Break DC Hit Points Drone 12 16 6 Praetorian 13 17 12																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Scent (Ex)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:This special quality allows an Alien to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Aliens can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. The Alien can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When an Alien detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed-only its presence somewhere within range. The Alien can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the Alien comes within 5 feet of the source, the Alien pinpoints the source's location. An Alien with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Aliens tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.												SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Sense Fear (Su)									KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:An adult Alien can sense fear in prey up to 25 ft. away.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.
� Tremorsense (Ex)								KEY:xxx ~					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:xxx Race Ability.Race Ability.SpecialQuality		DESC:Aliens are sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground, up to 60 feet. They can also sense the location of creatures moving through water.
