Awesome Blow			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Str 25, Power Attack, Improved Bull Rush, size Large or larger.																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:As a standard action, the creature may choose to subtract 4 from its melee attack roll and deliver an awesome blow. If the creature hits a corporeal opponent smaller than itself with an awesome blow, its opponent must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the attacking creature's choice and fall prone. The attacking creature can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the attacking creature than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in the space adjacent to the obstacle.

Normal: Characters without this feat in light gravity take a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks. All items weigh half as much.

Characters with no special training have a hard time moving, much less fighting, in low gravity.

SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:The character's attacks with improvised weapons deal more damage.

Virgin				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: If you don't know, ask your parents.																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.17	BENEFIT:So long as the character retains his or her virginity, he receives a +2 morale bonus to all saving throws. Characters who lose their virginity immediately lose this feat and become Jason-bait.
Zero-G Maneuvering		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PRETEXT:Prerequisites: Dex 13+, Low-G Maneuvering							DESC:The character is practiced at moving and fighting effectively in micro gravity (less than .1 G, also called "zero G"). The character is practiced at moving and fighting effectively in micro gravity. Characters with no special training will be spending all their time trying to stay oriented. If a character without experience or training in micro gravity gets involved in a fight, he doesn't stand much of a chance. Even if his opponent doesn't kill him, the character could send him spinning off into infinity by not adjusting for the recoil of his weapon.	SOURCEPAGE:p.18	BENEFIT:The character operates in these environments with no penalty to Attack or Skill checks, and is able to deal with weapons that have recoil more effectively. The character must still make a Reflex Save to use a weapon with Recoil, but he suffers only half the normal Recoil penalty to his Save, and is only considered Flat- Footed if he fails, not prone. Normal: Characters without this feat move at 1/4 Speed, suffer -6 to Attack and Skill checks, modified by their Dex Modifier. Also, if the character is using a weapon with a Recoil Rating, he must make a Reflex Save each round he attacks with that weapon (DC 15, modified by the weapon's Recoil), or be considered prone, floating away in a random direction each round until he is able to either grab onto a solid object or make a Balance check (DC as above +5) to right himself. Also, if the character is forced to make a Reflex save for any reason and fails, he suffers the above result.
