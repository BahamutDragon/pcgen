# Ability Name			Unique Key						SORTKEY				Category of Ability		Type							Define						Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											Modify VAR																			Source Page
Psychic (Adaptation)		KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Adaptation		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_A		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput	DESC:You can adapt your body to survive in hostile environments. Reqirements: Psychometabolism feat Check: Whenever you are required to make a Fortitude save or Constitution check to resist the eff ects of the environment, you can make an Adaptation check instead, using your psychic ability to improve your ability to withstand diff erent environments. Note that Adaptation does not help you against anything that requires a Reflex saving throw or anything other than an environmental condition. It does not, for example, protect against falling damage or catching on fire (both of which require Reflex saves). Special: You can't take 10 or take 20 on Adaptation checks. Time: Adaptation is a free action. Strain: 1 per check.
Psychic (Apport)			KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Apport			SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_A		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:You can teleport a target as a standard action. Distance is not a factor. The base DC is 10, modified by the object's mass, its familiarity to you, and the familiarity of the destination. For example, apporting a 10-pound object (DC +0) that is in your line of sight (DC +0) to a destination in your line of sight (DC +0), such as apporting an opponent's weapon into your hand, is DC 10. Apporting the same object in your line of sight to a somewhat familiar destination (DC +15) is DC 25. If the object is out of your line of sight and only somewhat familiar, the DC is increased to 40, and so forth. Generally, the DC of apporting an adult human is +10 for mass, plus familia rity modifiers. Unwilling creatures get a Reflex saving throw to resist apportation of themselves or any object they are wearing, carrying, or holding. A successful save means there is no effect. You must apport an entire object, not simply part of it, although unattached materials may be left behind. For example, you can apport a rope or p air of manacles without affecting the creature bound by them. Targets cannot be apported inside other solid objects: attempts to do so Simply fail, although the Gamemaster may permit the apported target to appear in the nearest open space to the desired destination. &nl; [Special] You can take 10 on an Apport check, but you can't take 20.&nl; [Time] Apport is a standard action.&nl; [Strain] 1 plus familiarity and mass modifiers.

Psychic (Blink Teleport)	KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Blink Teleport		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_B		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:No Check. You can rapidly "blink" in and out of an area, appearing and disappearing from reality. Attacks have a 50%% miss chance against you while you are blinking and you suffer only half damage from area attacks. You strike as an invisible creature, with a +2 attack bonus and deny your target his Dexterity bonus to AC. &nl; Time - Blink Teleport is a move action. You can blink for a number of rounds equal to half your Blink Teleport ranks (rounded up). To continue blinking, take an additional move action and pay the strain cost for the skill again.&nl; Strain 3																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.24
Psychic (Body Control)		KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Body Control		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_B		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:You have mental control over your body. Check: You can make a Body Control check for a number of different tasks, described below.	DESC:&nl; Sleep normally despite distractions 5	DESC:&nl; Sleep normally despite difficult distractions 10	DESC:&nl; Slow breathing to half normal rate 10	DESC:&nl; Ignore pain or injury 10+ damage dealt	DESC:&nl; Body awareness 15	DESC:&nl; Speed recovery 15	DESC:&nl; Slow breathing to one-quarter normal rate 15	DESC:&nl; Feign death and delay poison 20	DESC:&nl; Overcome disease Disease's DC	DESC:&nl; Overcome poison Poison's DC 	DESC:&nl; Sleeping: A successful Body Control check allows you to sleep in difficult conditions, including bad weather, noise, buzzing insects, and so forth.	DESC:&nl; Slow Breathing: You can deliberately slow your rate of breathing so that you consume less air, vital in situations where there is only a limited amount of breathable air available.	DESC:&nl; Ignore Pain: You can ignore the eff ects of pain or injury while awake or asleep. If you choose, nothing can wake you, as long as you make a successful Body Control check.	DESC:&nl; Body Awareness: Conversely, you can become very aware of your body while asleep or concentrating. Th is allows you to sense if you are touched or moved in any way while using Remote Viewing, for example. If you are damaged, subtract the amount of damage dealt from the DC of the Body Control check.	DESC:&nl; Speed Recovery: You can speed your natural recovery process, regaining hit points at twice the normal rate (or level x 2 hp per day's rest).	DESC:&nl; Feign Death: By exerting supreme control over your body, you can enter a deep trance almost indistinguishable from death. A Spot check with a DC equal to your Body Control check is required to determine that you are still alive. Effects that detect life still work normally on you. While in this state, you also suspend the effects of any disease or poison in your system for as long as you remain in the trance.	DESC:&nl; Overcome Disease or Poison: By concentrating for a full round, you can substitute your Body Control skill check for your Fortitude saving throw against a disease or poison in your system. Th is usually means you can only use Body Control against the secondary eff ects of a disease or poison, unless it is slow acting and you are warned soon enough to use Body Control to resist the initial eff ects (in the GM's judgment). Special: You can take 10 on Body Control checks, but you can't take 20. Time: Body Control is a full-round action. The effects last as long as you concentrate. Strain: DC divided by 5.
Psychic (Empathy)			KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Empathy			SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_E		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:An Empathy check allows you to determine the emotional state of the subject. The target gets to make a Will save to resist your attempt. Whether you succeed or fail, the subject does not know that you are reading his emotions. If the target's save fails, you get a general idea of his emotions and mood. This grants you a psychic bonus on the next skill check you make against the subject within the next 10 rounds (1 minute) using any of the following interaction skills - Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Perform, or Sense Motive. &nl; Special - You can take 10 when making an Empathy check but you can't take 20. Time - Empathy is a free action. The bonus lasts 10 rounds (1 minute) or until you make an interaction skill check against the target. &nl; Strain 1 &nl; [Up to 4 / +1]&nl; [5-14 / +2]&nl; [15-24 /+3]&nl; [25-34 / +4]&nl; [35+ / +5]																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.29
Psychic (Mental Contact)	KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Mental Contact		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_M		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:You can make psychic contact with another mind. The base DC is 10, modified by fami liarity. If the subject has a Psychic Shield, you have to make a Mental Contact check to overcome it. An unwilling subject gets a Will saving throw to avoid contact. If the save is successful, no contact is made. If you do not want the subject to know that you are making mental contact, you can make a Mental Contact check against the subject's Wisdom, Psychic Sense, or Psychic Shield check (whichever has the highest bonus). If you win, the subject is unaware of your attempt. If the subject wins, he is aware of your attempt (whether you succeed or fail). While you are in mental contact with another creature, the two of you can communicate at the rate of normal speech, "hearing" each other's transmitted thoughts. You can also send a single visual image each round instead of speaking. Both you and the subject can choose to lie or omit information; you're "speaking" to each other telepathically, not reading each other's thoughts. Mental contact is two-way, meaning that you are in mental contact with the subject for purposes of his psychic skills and vice versa. If a friendly mental contact turns hostile, the subject can make a Will saving throw or Psychic Shield check to break contact. Once the subject has failed a Will save to eject the intruder from his mind, he can't break the contact. The intruder is in his mind until he chooses to break contact or some outside force interferes, such as a distraction or another psychic skill such as Psychic Shield or Psychic Static. If your mental contact is broken, any other psychic skills you are maintaining that require mental contact are also broken.																					SOURCEPAGE:p.31

Psychic (Psychic Shield)	KEY:Psychic Skill ~ Psychic Shield		SORTKEY:Psychic Skill_Ps	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Psychic.SkillOutput								DESC:When you are the target of any psychic skill that grants a Will saving throw, you can make a Psychic Shield skill check instead. The attacker must make a skill check using the attacking psychic skill. If your check result is higher, the attack fails. If the attacker's result is higher, the psychic skill affects you normally, but you still get a normal saving throw. You may choose to voluntarily lower your Psychic Shield as a free action (and can raise it again as a free action as well). Otherwise, your shield is assumed to always be active, even if you are unconscious or sleeping.
