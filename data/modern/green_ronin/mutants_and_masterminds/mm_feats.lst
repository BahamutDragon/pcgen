The GM will typically make Detect checks for you, informing you when you sense something.
Durability				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Super																																						PRETEXT:Damage Save Bonus +1 or higher					DESC:You're hard to seriously hurt or kill.																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:Any lethal damage with a damage bonus equal to or less than your Damage save bonus becomes stun damage instead, meaning that the damage cannot disable you, only knock you unconscious.
Extra Limb				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Super																																																	DESC:You have one or more extra limbs.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:You have one or more additional limbs. They may be arms, legs, tentacles, or even prehensile hair. You can get wings with this super-feat, but they do not convey the ability to fly (for that, you'll want Flight with the Restricted (wings) flaw as explained in Chapter 5). While your extra limbs don't allow you to perform any additional actions In a round, they do allow you to perform actions not possible for normal people, such as pinning someone with two arms then hitting him with another, hanging upside down by a prehensile tail, or attacking someone directly behind you With your prehensile hair. Your extra limbs have the same Strength and Dexterity as your normal limbs. Only one limb can be your "good hand" the rest are considered "off hand."

Identity Change			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Super																																																	DESC:You can switch between your super identity and normal identity at will.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:You have Ihe ability to switch between your costumed "super" identity and your "normal" identity at will, taking only a half action to do so.

You are Immune to any harm from that condition and automatically succeed on ability checks Of saving throws against it (see The Environment, p. 142). Attacks based on the condition still affect you, but you always take only stun damage from them, not lethal damage. So, for example, if you have Immunity (fire), you don't need to make constitution checks to avoid fatigue or damage even while swimming through molten lava. If you are struck with a flame blast, you would still need to make a normal Damage save, but you'd only take stun damage even if the blast would normally inflict lethal damage. Gamemasters can allow players to come up with Immunities other than the ones listed here, but should keep in mind that Immunity generally applies to environmental conditions, not specific attacks. A character cannot be Immune to Dazzle attacks, for example (that is the Sensory Protection power, p. 8O). Special: You can take thia feat multiple times.

SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:You can see through solid objects like an x-ray. While using Penetration Vision, objects appear transparent to you.

Power Immunity			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Super																																																	DESC:You are Immune to the effects of your powers. even if they're Wielded by someone else!																													SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:You cannot be harmed or affected by your own powers in any way. This includes having your attacks reflected back at you and provides complete protection against attacks by others who have mimicked or transferred your powers to them, so long as the attack in question uses a power stolen from you.

Power Stunt				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Super																																																	DESC:You can use one of your powers in an enhanced or unusual way.																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.51	BENEFIT:A power stunt either grants you a bonus when using one of your powers under particular Circumstances or it allows you to use a power in a different way than normal, expanding the power's flexibility.

If successful, you sense me use of the psionic power. The DC of the check increases by +1 for every 10 feet of distance between you and the user or the target or the psionic power (whichever is closer to you). If you are targeted by a psionic power, a successful Sense motive check allows you to know the Identity of your attacker (if you are familiar with him or her). Special: At the GM's discretion, this feat can apply to other power sources. With each source requiring a separate feat.
Radio Hearing			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Super	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Radio Hearing																										PRESTAT:1,WIS=13																	DESC:You can broadcast radio signals.

SOURCEPAGE:p.52	BENEFIT:You can hear radio and television broadcasts as if you were a living radio receiver.

Scent					CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Super																														PRESTAT:1,WIS=13																	DESC:You have an extraordinarily heightened sense of smell.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.52	BENEFIT:You can detect approaching aeatures. Sniff out hidden foes. and track by sense of smell alone. You can Identity familiar scents the same way most people identify familiar sights. You can detect the presence of creatures within 30 feet by sense of smell. If a creature is upwind, this distance is doubled to 60 feet. If downwind. It IS halved to 15 feet The Telescopic Sense (smell) power doubles these distances per rank (see p. 88). Particularly strong scents (in the GM's estimation) may be detected at double or triple your normal range. Detecting a scent requlles a spot check (DC 10). The exact location of the scent is not revealed - only its presence somewhere within range. A half action allows you to note the direction of the scent If the source is within 5 feet of you, you can pinpoint Its exact Ioca· tIOn. Note that this means you ignore the effects of being unable to see a creature (because of Cover or Invisibility) so long as you are within 5 feet. You can follow tracks using your sense of smell, making a Survival check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the type of surface). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's scent is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. This ability otherwise works like the Track feat, except that you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
