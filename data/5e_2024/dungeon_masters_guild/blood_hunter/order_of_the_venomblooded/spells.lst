Challenger's Mark		INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip		SCHOOL:Enchantment				CASTTIME:1 action												RANGE:5 feet	COMPS:V, S	DURATION:1 round			DESC:As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you exchange a moment of silent, instinctive communication that expresses your personal challenge. Before the beginning of your next turn, if the target willingly moves more than 30 feet away from you or attacks a creature besides you, it immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the spell ends. This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target, and the damage the target suffers for moving more than 30 feet away from you increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.
Create Poison		INFO:SpellLevel|1st level	SCHOOL:transmutation	DESCRIPTOR:ritual	CASTTIME:1 action												RANGE:Self (one vessel on your person)	COMPS:V, S, M (a small bottle or other container that can holds a draught of water)	DURATION:Instantaneous		DESC:You use some combination of scavenged substances, focused meditation, and magic to transform the water in a container you have on your person into a one dose of improvised poison. The dose of improvised poison you create can be applied to one weapon, up to three pieces of ammunition, or up to three separate portions of food or drink. Once applied, the poison retains potency until someone must roll a saving throw against it, or for 1 minute, after which point it dries or dissolves. If a creature is struck with the poisoned weapon or ammunition, or if it ingests the poisoned food or drink, it must make a Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 minute and take 1d8 poison damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested. Creatures that succeed on their save take half damage, but suffer no other effects. This poison you create can only be used by you, and has no value if you try to sell it. If you cast this spell again, any doses of poison you have previously created with this spell instantly become water again. Otherwise, poison doses created with this spell retain their potency until the next time you finish a long rest, at which point they return to being water. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional dose of poison for every two levels above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the poison gains an extra effect: if a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4.
Greater Water to Poison	INFO:SpellLevel|5th level	SCHOOL:transmutation				CASTTIME:1 action												RANGE:30 feet	COMPS:V, S, M (a serpent's tooth)	DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:You transform any large quantity of water within a 10 foot cube centered on a point you choose into a deadly poison. This spell only affects bodies of water of at least 10 gallons or more within the affected area, not separate smaller quantities of water. It can also be liquid that is mostly water (such as blood, sewage, or wine), but a living creature's vital fluids cannot be affected. Any creature with its head one of its breathing passages (such as a humanoid's nose or mouth) currently submerged into water you have transformed with this spell must make a make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of any turn in which they are so submerged. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for the duration, and they take 4d8 poison damage. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. On a success, the creature can choose to spit the water out and take no damage, or continue to swallow it and take half damage. If the creature failed its save, at the start of each of the creature's turns before the spell ends, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 poison damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. Creatures who do not need to save against the spell but who are within 5 feet of the transformed water can use an action to apply poison to one weapon, piece of ammunition, or portions of food or drink. Once applied, the poison retains potency for the duration of the spell or until someone must save against it. If a creature is struck with the poisoned weapon or ammunition, or if it ingests the poisoned food or drink, it must make a Constitution save or be poisoned for the duration and take 1d8 poison damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. Creatures that succeed on their save take half damage, but suffer no other effects. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature who is drinking at the same time, and the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
Lesser Water to Poison	INFO:SpellLevel|4th level	SCHOOL:transmutation				CASTTIME:1 reaction, which you take when a creature within 30 feet of you drinks	RANGE:30 feet	COMPS:S, M (a vessel of water or a beverage which is partially water, with which you make a toasting gesture to the target as you both drink)	DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:Waiting for just the right moment, you transform the water someone is drinking into deadly poison. The quantity of water does not matter, just that the target drinks more than a sip. It can also be a beverage that is partially water (such as wine, beer, or juice). The creature who drinks makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for the duration, and they take 4d8 poison damage. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. On a success, the creature can choose to spit the water out and take no damage, or continue to swallow it and take half damage. If the creature failed its save, at the start of each of the creature's turns before the spell ends, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d8 poison damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature who is drinking at the same time, and the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
Reaver's Touch		INFO:SpellLevel|Cantrip		SCHOOL:Necromancy					CASTTIME:1 action												RANGE:Touch	COMPS:V, S	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:Your touch drains a target's life energy, allowing you to empower yourself via the ritual sacrifice of animals and other creatures, or by striking your opponents in combat. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack if your target is a beast. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage inflicted (rounded up). The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
