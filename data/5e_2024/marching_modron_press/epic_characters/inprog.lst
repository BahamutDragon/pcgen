# Rogue - 32
Epic Flavor
Before starting an epic game, you might want to consider

Fate's Benison

you. Work with your DM to find a suitable benison for your
rogue.
Fate's Benison
d6 Effect
1 Light isn't reflected from you like from other creatures,
causing your intricate features to be slightly blurred and
making you harder to identify.
2 Lady Luck favors you and you seem to always land on your
feet. For example, when gambling, at worst you break even,
when walking in a random direction, you always seem to
pick a direction that brings you closer to your goal.
3 When you land a killing blow, fate manifests a peculiarity.
For example, the fatal wound could somehow always
appear in a particular shape, or the slain creature could
always remain standing (while dead) for an additional
round before falling to the ground.
4 If a creature that doesn't know you well learns of your
name and doesn't write it down, it Inexplicably forgets the
name after 24 hours.

means. Hardly noticing it yourself, you adopt local dialects
and mannerisms, making it impossible to discern where
you grew up or to pick you out from a crowd.
6 Your deeds aren't attributed to you, but rather to
a legendary rogue - a persona of almost mythical
proportions. This persona is known by a mystical name
such as "the Silence" or "the Sudden Blade". If you can
convince another that you are this legendary rogue, you
may be able to reap the benefits (or become a target).

persona.

Intensify Spell
Beginning at 24th level, you gain the ability to intensify your
offensive spells. Using this feature, all variable, numeric effects
of a spell are maximized, then doubled. An intensified
spell deals twice maximum damage, cures twice the maximum
number of hit points, affects twice the maximum number
of targets, and so forth, as appropriate. Saving throws
and opposed rolls are not affected. An intensified spell uses
up all spell slots of the spell's actual level, but a minimum of
three, and once you use this feature, you immediately gain
one level of exhaustion.
For example, you could cast the fireball spell using all of
your 5th level spell slots (but a minimum of three), to deal
120 fire damage in a 40-foot radius, rather than 10d6 fire
damage in a 20-foot radius if you had used just a single 5th
level spell slot.
An intensified spell can't be interrupted by spells or effects
such as the counterspell spell.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long
rest before you can do so again.
Weave Conduit
Tapping into the Weave comes as easily to you as flicking a
finger. With some effort, you can cause the Weave spill forth
from within you, manifesting as violent arcane energy that
crackles outwards from you in all directions.
Starting at 30th level, by spending 5 sorcery points (no
action required), you can become a weave conduit until the
start of your next turn. For the duration, you are no longer
limited to casting only one spell on your turns and each
creature that starts or ends its turn within 5 feet of you
takes 2d12 force damage and is pushed 15 feet away from
you in a straight line. In addition, you can use all Metamagic
options, including ones you haven't learned, and you
can empower a single spell with any number of Metamagic
options.
You can extend the duration on a subsequent turn by expending
3 additional sorcery points at the start of that turn.
