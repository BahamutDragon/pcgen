# Ability Name					Unique Key							Category of Ability		Type															Description																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	Ability																																																																			Bonus to Ability Pool					Modify VAR					Source Page		List of Known Class Spells by Level
Level 1: Spellcasting				KEY:Cleric ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods themselves, flowing from them into the world. As a cleric, you are a conduit for that power. You combine your will with your deity's and manifest it as miraculous effects. The gods do not grant this power lightly or to everyone who seeks it, but only to those they choose to fulfill a high calling of service to their aims. Harnessing and channeling divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. You might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but ultimately your ability to cast cleric spells relies on your intuitive understanding of your deity's wishes, your ability to attune yourself to the god's presence, and your zeal to impose your combined wills on the world. Benefit: You can cast a number of cleric spells per day based on the number of spell slots you receive for your cleric level, as noted in the Cleric Spells per Day table. You can also cast cantrips, which you gain from the Deity feature. Wisdom is your magic ability score. Spell Preparation: You must prepare your spells before casting them. After a long rest, you regain all your spell slots, and you can prepare a number of spells by spending time in prayer. You can prepare a number of spells equal to 1 + your cleric level, choosing any spell you wish from the cleric spells you can cast. You will usually want to prepare at least one spell of each level you can cast. Preparing your spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least one minute per spell level for each spell you prepare. Casting a Spell: When you cast a spell, choose one of your prepared spells and use a spell slot of that spell's level or higher. Some spells have improved effects when they are cast at higher levels. After you cast the spell, you lose the use of that slot until you prepare spells again, but you still have the spell prepared. You can use your spell slots to cast any combination of spells you have prepared, as long as you respect the limit on spells you can cast of a specific level. For example, if you have bless and cure wounds prepared and have two 1st-level spell slots available, you can cast each spell once or cast one of those spells twice. Rituals: You can cast any spell you have prepared as a ritual, provided that the spell has a ritual version. Saving Throw DCs: When a cleric spell that you cast calls for a saving throw, the save DC equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + the spellcasting bonus for your level, as noted in the Cleric table.
Level 1: Channel Divinity			KEY:Cleric ~ Channel Divinity				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:You have the ability to perform miracles by acting as a conduit for raw divine power. When you do so, you channel energy directly from your deity, using it to fuel exceptional magical effects. Benefit: You can channel divinity once per day. Your deity choice determines how you can channel divinity. As you gain levels, you gain additional uses of this feature each day, as noted in the Cleric table. When you channel divinity, you choose an option granted by your deity and gain its benefits. Each channel divinity option explains how to use it. Here are the most common options.

A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. If you are at least 11th level, the damage increases to 6d8.
Trickster's Boon					KEY:Channel Divinity ~ Trickster's Boon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.ClericChannelDivinity			DESC:As an action, you can expend a use of your channel divinity to cast the mirror image spell.

When you do so, each undead creature within 25 feet of you that has hit points equal to or less than twice your cleric level is destroyed. Each remaining undead creature within 25 feet of you that has hit points equal to or less than five times your cleric level is turned. A turned creature is affected for 1 minute or until it takes damage from an attack or a spell. It must spend its turns trying to get as far away from you as it can. It cannot willingly move within 25 feet of you (unless there is nowhere else it can move), it cannot take reactions, and it can use its actions only to hustle or to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

Level 1: Deity					KEY:Cleric ~ Deity					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:The deity you serve or the philosophical system you adopt grants you access to divine magic and is the source of the magical energy you need to cast spells. Your dedicated service to your deity or philosophy is what makes you a cleric, and this service influences not just your capabilities but the core of your being. Benefit: Choose a deity from the options presented in this section. (Your DM might offer different or additional options.) Your choice of deity grants you various special abilities, including spells that are associated with the god's domain of influence. If you have a domain spell that does not appear on the cleric's spell list, the spell is, nonetheless, a cleric spell for you. The deity choices are iconic appellations rather than specific deity names. Depending on your DM's campaign, these deities might have many different names. In effect, each deity presented here is a template that can be used for a number of gods from myth and various D&amp;D worlds. Similarly, a given deity from myth or from a D&amp;D setting could encompass multiple options from this section. Your choice might reflect a focus on only one aspect of that deity, which might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to that deity. Thus, two clerics serving the same sun god might make different choices for the purpose of this class feature. One character might choose the Lightbringer option and another could choose the Protector option, assuming both options relate to the same god. [SELECT A DEITY FROM THE DOMAIN TAB]

The Arcanist					KEY:Deity ~ The Arcanist				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:In a world rife with magical power and populated by wizards, dragons, and other magical beings, the Arcanist is the god who shepherds, teaches, and sometimes even embodies that power. This god is often also a deity of knowledge and learning, but in some pantheons those domains are separate. The nature and personality of the Arcanist typically reflects a culture's attitude toward the practice of magic-a kindly Arcanist reflects a positive view of the role of magic in the world where wizards are often kindly sages, while an Arcanist who is grim and secretive might emerge in a culture where magic is shunned or outlawed, practiced by witches and dark sorcerers. Hecate of the Olympian pantheon is a dark expression of the Arcanist. In the Pharaonic pantheon, Isis is an Arcanist revered at a popular level with countless charms and prayers, while Thoth, as god of knowledge, also represents the hidden mysteries of the universe, the understanding of which is expressed as magical power. In the Asgardian pantheon, Odin sacrificed an eye to gain the same kind of knowledge of hidden mysteries, while Freya is the goddess of enchantments and illusions. Mystra is the goddess of magic in the FORGOTTEN REALMSR pantheon, whose essence is the Weave that provides magic to the world, and Azuth is patron of wizards specifically. Among the gods of GREYHAWKR, Boccob is a god of knowledge and magic, while Wee Jas is a darker god of death and necromancy. The DRAGONLANCER pantheon has three gods of magic, corresponding to the three moons: good Solinari, neutral Lunitari, and evil Nuitari. These three gods are rarely worshiped, however. The Arcanist is most often neutral, but can have any alignment depending on the deity's attitude toward magic.	DESC:&nl; Cantrips: You know the mage armor cantrip, plus two other cantrips of your choice from the cleric's or wizard's cantrip list.	DESC:&nl; Disciple of Magic: You can use magic items that normally require you to be a wizard to use them.	DESC:&nl; Domain Spells: At 1st level and when you gain the ability to cast 2nd---, 3rd---, 4th---, and 5th---level cleric spells, choose a wizard spell of the same spell level. The chosen spell counts as a domain spell for you. You always have it prepared, and it does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

The Lifegiver					KEY:Deity ~ The Lifegiver				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:The Lifegiver takes a variety of forms, all of them involving growth, fertility, and healing. This deity is usually female and is sometimes an earth mother, a forest sprite, or a great ocean or river. The Lifegiver might appear as Demeter of the Olympian pantheon, Isis of the Pharaonic pantheon, Frigga of the Asgardian pantheon, Chauntea of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Beory of GREYHAWK, or Mishakal of DRAGONLANCE. As a devotee of life, you can foster health and healing in the people you attend. Your prayers can cause wounds to close and sickness to fade. Your divine patron urges you to cleanse the world of suffering and to provide aid to those in need. Life springs up and blooms around the paragons of your faith. Stories tell of blessed clerics who live for centuries without suffering aches, ills, or the ravages of age. Some are said to be able to heal with a glance, to cause withered crops to spring back to life where they walk, and to dull the physical and emotional pain of anyone who sees them. The Lifegiver is most often lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good.
The Lightbringer					KEY:Deity ~ The Lightbringer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:The Lightbringer is a sun deity, whose followers are infused with radiant light and the power of the sun's searing heat. This deity is sometimes the ruler of a pantheon and is often portrayed as the sun itself or a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. The sun's daily course means that the Lightbringer can embody principles of rebirth or renewal, but some sun deities are the sun at high noon, looking down upon the mortal world to pronounce judgment and burn away evil. The Lightbringer models Apollo of the Olympian pantheon, Re-Horakhty of the Pharaonic pantheon (also called Ra or Horus-Re), Frey and Odur of the Asgardian pantheon, Pelor and Pholtus of GREYHAWK, and Lathander and Amaunator of the FORGOTTEN REALMS. The Lightbringer entrusts you with the sun's power so you can become a beacon of light in a darkened world. You bring light wherever you go, chasing away shadows and burning away darkness. Your prayers can bring forth sunlight, which you might focus into burning rays or let loose to shine its wholesome light. The most devoted and enlightened followers of the Lightbringer shine with their own inner light. Creatures of darkness and death cower in the presence of the mightiest of your faith, unable to bear the brightness of their countenance. The Lightbringer is most often lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, or lawful neutral.
The Protector					KEY:Deity ~ The Protector				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:The Protector is a god of defensive strength, an unyielding force that guards against the forces of evil. Sometimes the Protector is a martial deity, usually male, who stands as the ideal for sentinels and paladins. Other times the Protector is primarily a god of community, often female, who embodies the community's cohesiveness and responsibility to protect and care for each other. Examples of the first aspect include Athena of the Olympian pantheon, Heimdall of the Asgardian pantheon, Heironeous or Mayaheine of GREYHAWK, Helm of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Paladine of DRAGONLANCE, and Moradin, god of dwarves. Examples of the community aspect of the Protector include Hestia of the Olympian pantheon, Hathor of the Pharaonic pantheon, Frigga of the Asgardian pantheon, Eldath of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Berei or Merikka of GREYHAWK, and Yondalla, goddess of halflings. The Protector entrusts you with the strength and endurance to protect the innocent so that you can become a beacon of hope in a darkened world. You protect the weak from the wicked, and nothing stirs your righteous fury so much as witnessing harm brought to those your god calls you to protect. The most devoted and enlightened followers of the Protector are bulwarks of defense in a violent world. Many seek to take the fight to the enemy, delving into dungeons to root out threats before they can spread. On the edge of civilization, the Protector's clerics organize defenses, train local militias, and bring justice to a lawless land. The Protector is most often lawful good, neutral good, or lawful neutral.
The Reaper						KEY:Deity ~ The Reaper					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:A figure of grim countenance and sinister reputation, the Reaper is a deity of death, the end of the cycle of life, and the decay of all things. This deity is typically a creature of doom and evil and often a patron of necromancers and the undead, but in some pantheons the Reaper merely represents the natural end of life and is an enemy of the undead. The Reaper is analogous to Hel of the Asgardian pantheon, Hades of the Olympian pantheon, Anubis or Osiris of the Pharaonic pantheon, Myrkul or Kelemvor of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Nerull or Wee Jas of GREYHAWK, or Morgion of DRAGONLANCE. As a follower of the Reaper, you spread the power of death through the land. If you are not evil, you tend to the dead and dying, ensuring that their souls pass to their rightful rewards. If you are evil, you raise the undead to do your bidding, and you spread fear and death wherever you go. Clerics of the Reaper can spread death with a touch, claiming the souls of the weak in their deity's name. The undead cow before their might, and they face either a swift destruction or a compulsion to obey the cleric's dictates. The Reaper is most often neutral, lawful neutral, or neutral evil.
The Stormcaller					KEY:Deity ~ The Stormcaller				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:The ferocious Stormcaller is a deity of thunder, lightning, and storms, and often also of war, physical might, and courage. Most often, the Stormcaller is a barbaric deity, commonly male, with a fury and physical prowess to match the raw power of the storm. In some pantheons, the Stormcaller is a ruler of the gods whose domain is the whole sky, and who is often known for swift, violent justice delivered via thunderbolt. In the pantheons of seafaring people, the Stormcaller is often an ocean deity and patron of sailors. Zeus of the Olympian pantheon is an example of a Stormcaller who rules the gods and the sky, while Thor of the Asgardian pantheon is the headstrong son of the sky god. Set of the Pharaonic pantheon is a god of destructive storms, while the FORGOTTEN REALMS pantheon includes three "Gods of Fury" who rule storms: Talos the Storm Lord, Auril the Frostmaiden, and Umberlee the Sea Queen. Like Umberlee, Procan of GREYHAWK and Zeboim of DRAGONLANCE are sea deities who are appeased to abate the fury of storms. As a follower of the Stormcaller, you call down lightning and thunder to smite your foes. The most accomplished followers of the Stormcaller command storms. Good clerics of the Stormcaller are tireless champions who wage war against evil. In comparison, the evil aspect of the Stormcaller is a bully whose followers dominate the weak and defenseless. The Stormcaller is most often chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil.
The Trickster					KEY:Deity ~ The Trickster				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:The Trickster is a god of trickery and thieves, a mischief-maker and instigator who stands as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. Unlike most other deities, the Trickster is often portrayed as an animal, such as a raven or a fox, as well as a shapechanger who can adopt any form at will. The Trickster is often also a god of luck, either good or bad. Examples of the Trickster include Hermes of the Olympian pantheon, Bes of the Pharaonic pantheon, Loki of the Asgardian pantheon, Beshaba or Tymora of the FORGOTTEN REALMS, Olidammara or Zagyg of GREYHAWK, and Garl Glittergold, god of gnomes. As a follower of the Trickster, you see the world as a grand game, which you play to get what you want. Subterfuge, pranks, and theft are often the tools you use, rather than direct confrontation. Of all the deities, the Trickster covers the widest moral ground. A chaotic good expression of the Trickster is a liberator and freedom fighter. The evil form of the Trickster delights in murder and wealth gained by any means. Standing in the middle of these two extremes, the chaotic neutral expression of this god is a capricious free spirit. The Trickster is most often chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil.
The Warbringer					KEY:Deity ~ The Warbringer				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Diety Selection				DESC:War has many manifestations. It can be glorious, making heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, mortals' worst traits writ large on the battlefield, with acts of cruelty, malice, and cowardice eclipsing those instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the Warbringer watches over warriors and rewards them for great bravery. Many pantheons have two gods that fill the role of the Warbringer, representing opposite ideals of warfare: Athena and Ares of the Olympian pantheon, the brothers Heironeous and Hextor of GREYHAWK, and Tyr and Tempus of the FORGOTTEN REALMS. The Warbringer attracts a wide range of individuals. You might be a courageous hero, a bold champion who inspires others to fight the good fight. Or you might see the battlefield as your temple and offer violence as prayers to your deity. Whatever your connection to warfare, you excel in battle and improve those who fight at your side. Paragons of your faith grow more and more like the deity they serve or the ideal of warfare they uphold. Most tales of the legendary followers of the Warbringer portray them as powerful generals or war chiefs, leading hordes in conquest or mustering armies to drive off invaders. They are often said to inspire courage or berserk fury in those who fight beside them. The shout of such a cleric can strike terror in enemies, and tales are told of battles won without a single blow struck, as armies quailed and fled before the wrath of a mighty champion of the Warbringer.

Level 1: Spellcasting				KEY:Druid ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:As a druid, you learn divine spells through prayer and ancient rites and draw on the primal strength of nature itself. You use this power to protect the wilderness, driving away those who would despoil it and fortifying those who would protect it. Benefit: You can cast a number of druid spells per day based on the number of spell slots you receive for your druid level, as noted in the Druid Spells per Day table. You can also cast cantrips. Wisdom is your magic ability. Cantrips: Your choice of druid circle determines the cantrips available to you. Spell Preparation: You must prepare your spells before casting them. After a long rest, you regain all your spell slots, and you can prepare a number of druid spells equal to 1 + your druid level. You can choose any spell from the druid's spell list, provided you can cast druid spells of that level. You will usually want to prepare at least one spell of each level you can cast. Preparing your spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least one minute per spell level for each spell you prepare. Casting a Spell: When you cast a spell, choose one of your prepared spells and use a spell slot of that spell's level or higher. Some spells have improved effects when they are cast at higher levels. After you cast the spell, you lose the use of that slot until you prepare spells again, but you still have the spell prepared. You can use your spell slots to cast any combination of spells you have prepared, as long as you respect the limit on spells you can cast of a specific level. For example, if you have entangle and animal friendship prepared and have two 1st- level spell slots available, you can cast each spell once or cast one of those spells twice. Rituals: You can cast any druid spell you have prepared as a ritual, provided that the spell has a ritual version. Saving Throw DCs: When a druid spell that you cast calls for a saving throw, the save DC equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + the spellcasting bonus for your level, as noted in the Druid table.
Level 1: Druid Lore				KEY:Druid ~ Druid Lore					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:The wilderness is your home. You have acquired the skills needed to survive off the land. Benefit: You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall natural lore. In addition, you know the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden signs for other druids. A hidden sign is a written message up to twenty words long. You and others who know this language automatically spot such messages. Others spot the messages' presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom check but cannot decipher it without magic.
Level 1: Wild Shape				KEY:Druid ~ Wild Shape					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Druid Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality							DESC:A druid learns that life is an elaborate web of energy that binds all creatures together. This knowledge allows you to assume new forms simply by using your magic to express your life energy in a new way. Benefit: Once per day, you can use your action to magically transform into another creature. Alternatively, you can transform as part of another action, provided that action doesn't involve casting a spell or activating a magic item. As you gain levels, you gain additional uses of this feature per day, as noted in the Druid table. At 1st-level, you have access to the shape of the hound. As you gain levels, you gain additional shapes that you can change into, as noted in the Druid table. When you transform, you choose from the creature options available to you and assume that creature's shape for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier + your druid level (minimum of 2 hours), after which time you revert to normal (use your Constitution modifier, not the creature's). You can use your action to revert to your normal shape earlier. You automatically revert to normal if you drop to 0 hit points or fewer or if you die. While you are in the creature's shape, the following rules apply. . Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature. You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. . Transforming into or out of the creature's shape has no effect on your hit points, even if the shape's Constitution score is different from yours. . You cannot cast spells or take any other actions that require hands or speech. Transforming does not break your concentration, however, on a spell you cast beforehand. . Your gear is subsumed by the creature's shape, so you cannot access it. You cannot activate a magic item on your person, but a magic item that confers a passive effect, such as a ring of protection, continues to do so.

Tall wolfhounds are popular in Celtic lands, jackals are prevalent in Pharaonic regions and near DARKSUN city-states, mastiffs guard the castle gates of many lords in GREYHAWK, and plains wolves range all across the FORGOTTEN REALMS. A hound form provides you with natural weaponry and a better chance of finding what would otherwise remain hidden.

Level 1: Spellcasting			KEY:Wizard ~ Spellcasting				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality					DESC: Arcane magic permeates the cosmos. Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, it draws many students who seek to master its mysteries, and some who aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. You have chosen the wizard's path to magical mastery, an approach requiring keen intellect and mental discipline to master the complex formulas used to apprehend arcane power and focus it into spells. As a wizard's apprentice, you compile a spellbook, which contains the spells taught by your master, your notes on how to wield magic safely, and the mystical formulas you have discovered in libraries. Your spellbook contains all the arcane knowledge you need to prepare your spells. Benefit: You can cast a number of wizard spells per day based on the number of spell slots you receive for your wizard level, as noted in the Wizard Spells per Day table. You can also cast cantrips, which you gain from the Tradition of Wizardry feature. Intelligence is your magic ability score. Spellbook: You have a spellbook containing the wizard spells that you know, other than your cantrips. The book starts with three 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard's spell list. Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add one spell to your spellbook. You choose the spell from the wizard's spell list, and it must be of a level that you can cast, as noted in the Wizard Spells per Day table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar). Spell Preparation: You must prepare your spells before casting them. After a long rest, you regain all your spell slots, and you can prepare spells from your spellbook. You can prepare a number of spells equal to 1 + your wizard level. You will usually want to prepare at least one spell of each level that you can cast. Preparing a spell requires you to study your spellbook and memorize the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell, taking at least one minute per spell level for each spell you prepare. If your spellbook is unavailable when you prepare spells, you can prepare only the spells that you prepared the day before. Casting a Spell: When you cast a spell, choose one of your prepared spells and expend a spell slot of that spell's level or higher. Some spells have improved effects when they are cast at higher levels. After you cast the spell, you lose the use of the slot you expended until you prepare spells again, but you still have the spell prepared. You can use your spell slots to cast any combination of spells you have prepared, as long as you respect the limit on spells you can cast of a specific level. For example, if you have burning hands and thunderwave prepared and have two 1st-level spell slots available, you can cast each spell once or cast one of those spells twice. Rituals: You can cast any spell you have prepared as a ritual, provided that the spell has a ritual version. Saving Throw DCs: When a wizard spell that you cast or a wizard feature that you use calls for a saving throw, the save DC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier + the spellcasting bonus for your level, as noted in the Wizard table.

Scholarly Wizardry			KEY:Tradition of Wizardry ~ Scholarly Wizardry	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Tradition of Wizardry	DESC:You learned your magic in an environment of intense study, relentless practice, and peer- reviewed scholarship. Though other wizards have mastered certain specializations, wizards of the scholarly tradition can master nearly any spell. The first magical academies were founded by elves while the human race was in its infancy, and many of these institutions still exist. Some of them admit humans and members of other races, and some do not. Humans have founded their own academies, and some rival the ancient elven ones-not least because they are more open to innovation and experimentation. When you cast spells, your utterances and gesticulations are smooth, proficient, and economical. Your meticulous spellcasting reveals the proud tradition of your scholastic craft. When people in the worlds of D&amp;D speak of wizards, they usually mean practitioners of scholarly wizardry. Wizards themselves sometimes refer to members of this tradition as scholastics. Cantrips: You learn four cantrips of your choice, chosen from the wizard's cantrip list. Spell Preparation: You can prepare one extra wizard spell at each level you can cast when you prepare spells. Spell Research: You start with an additional 1st-level wizard spell in your spellbook, and you learn two wizard spells every time you gain a level, instead of one. Ritual Caster: You can cast any spell in your spellbook as a ritual, provided that the spell has a ritual version.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.
School of Evocation			KEY:Tradition of Wizardry ~ School of Evocation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Tradition of Wizardry	DESC:You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects. Spells like burning hands, lightning bolt, and cone of cold live within your domain. You evoke the elemental powers of the Inner Planes of existence, creating magical effects that can deal serious damage to your enemies. Spells that deal with bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid all fall under your expertise. Evocation specialists are usually called evokers and are among the most common wizards employed by armies and other military forces. Cantrips: You learn one evocation cantrip, plus two other cantrips of your choice, chosen from the wizard's cantrip list. Spell Tactician: When you cast an evocation spell that deals damage to all creatures within an area of effect, you can pick a number of creatures in the area up to the spell's level + 1. The chosen creatures take no damage from the spell during this turn, but they are not protected from any of the spell's other effects, including damage dealt by the spell in a later turn. Scion of the Inner Planes: When you gain this feature, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. You gain resistance to that damage type. In addition, when you roll damage of that type for any of your spells, treat any 1 that you roll as a 2.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.
School of Illusion			KEY:Tradition of Wizardry ~ School of Illusion	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Tradition of Wizardry	DESC:You study magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but when combined with a keen mind, illusions can bring an entire kingdom to its knees. You might have studied under a private tutor, perhaps a disgraced scholastic or a roguish scoundrel, or in a small group of likeminded wizards. Among the gnomes, however, study of illusion is every bit as formal as the scholarly tradition is among humans and elves. Illusionists have something of a sinister reputation, owing to their penchant for trickery. Some illusionists revel in others' suspicion, casting themselves as mysterious figures. Other illusionists prefer to keep a low profile and might never reveal their study of this tradition. Cantrips: You learn one illusion cantrip, plus two other cantrips of your choice, chosen from the wizard's cantrip list. Arcane Deception: The DC for an ability check or a saving throw against any illusion spell you cast is increased by 2. Detect Illusions: You have advantage on saving throws and ability checks against illusion spells and other magical illusions. Additionally, when you are conscious and able to take actions, you automatically detect the presence of invisible creatures within 30 feet of you. You become aware of the creature's presence, though it remains invisible to you.

Ambusher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:You have trained in hit-and-run tactics and excel at maximizing the benefits of surprise. Your abilities help you get the drop on your enemies, make the most of hiding, and fight on the run. These abilities are usually earned through hard- won experience. You might have grown up in the shadow of a great evil that made regular forays into your homelands. Faced with an overwhelming foe, you learned from a young age to set traps, wait in ambush, and defeat a much more powerful enemy by using your knowledge of your homeland to your advantage. Or you might have been a bandit or raider yourself, but given up that life for a career on the right side of the law.

Defender			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:Through conscious effort or menacing presence, you command attention on the battlefield. You protect those who cannot protect themselves, often putting yourself at great risk by intercepting enemies' attacks. Alert, wary, and often selfless, you stand as a bulwark against the tide of enemy combatants. Defenders arise from many different backgrounds and professions. You might have been a professional soldier, having learned techniques from fighting in military formations. Alternatively, you could be a valiant knight, and the act of protection arises from a singular commitment to a chivalric code.

Hedge Magician		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:You are a self-taught magic user, colloquially referred to as a hedge magician. You learned magic on your own, teaching yourself using lore you managed to scrounge and constant trial and error-not to mention a healthy dose of what can best be described as mystic insight. The abilities you gain as you progress along this path include learning to combine material components to create potions, securing the assistance of a helpful spirit, internalizing the basic formulas of the simplest spells, then learning how to defend yourself from other magicians who might come calling. You might be a hermit, teaching yourself the basics of magic while exiled from civilization. Alternatively, you might be one of the cunning folk (or a witch, depending on how the local villagers feel about you), learning magic according to ancient rites and teachings handed down over the generations.

Many spellcasters train in the art of metamagic in order to get the most out of their spells. You understand better than anyone else how to twist your spells to get the desired effect, surprising your foes with your versatility. You likely spent some time studying magical theory, for example as a student in a wizard's academy or a scholar in a magical library. Alternatively, you might have learned how to manipulate your spells through painful trial and error, leaving you with scars of failed experiments.

You know how to conjure magical healing to seal wounds and purge the body of poisons. Your ministrations bring hope to the hopeless, health to the sick, and perhaps even life to the dying. You might have been an apprentice to a village herb gatherer, a wise one who tended to the villagers' ills. Or perhaps you learned at the side of a wealthy family's personal physician. You could have served as a medic in a military company, aiding injured soldiers while battle raged around you. Or perhaps you are an initiate of a deity such as the Lifegiver, charged with offering healing wherever it is needed.

Polearm Master		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:Polearms, such as glaives, halberds, and other reach weapons, are typically the weapon of choice for well-armed masses of infantry. Their length allows tightly packed ranks of warriors to deliver many attacks at once, and they also excel at creating defensive formations against larger creatures. You have trained with polearms, likely as part of a militia or other military unit, and have learned to apply what you know to the small, desperate skirmishes that adventurers face. Many adventuring fighters with a background as mercenaries practice this specialty.

You prefer using the biggest weapon you can find to deliver the most devastating blows possible. You likely trained in a mercenary company or other group that focused on battling large creatures. Hill giants and ogres rely on their endurance to overwhelm their foes. Your training has taught you to bring such foes down.

They have perfected their techniques with ranged weapons, letting them launch missile after missile with incredible speed and precision. While many sharpshooters favor bows, some use thrown weapons, slings, and even crossbows. As a sharpshooter, you may be an archer in the king's army, a crossbow-toting assassin ever- ready for assignment, or a hunter whose life and livelihood depend on your ability to bring down prey with a streaking arrow.

Skirmisher			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:The best way to avoid being a target is to never stand still. You know that being fast, mobile, and slippery is sure to guarantee your enduring safety. Likewise, your speed catches your enemies off- guard, allowing you to slip in, strike, and then retreat before your enemies have a chance to pin you down. You might be a scout, used to traveling over long distances and evading danger instead of confronting it head-on. Alternatively, you might have lived as a street urchin, where your ability to move quickly through dangerous areas saved you from being snatched up by the city watch, or worse, having your meager possessions stolen by other street toughs.

Skulker			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:A subtle approach sometimes is the best way to deal with a powerful opponent or a touchy situation. Why trouble the giants guarding an enormous ruby when you can slip in and take it without disturbing them? Your approach makes things easier for everyone. You're a master of stealth, hiding in circumstances that others would find impossible and learning to avoid the common mistakes that scouts and sneak-thieves make to give themselves away. The life of an adventurer is probably not all that different from what you did before. You might have been a scout, sneaking up on enemy forces to learn details of their movements or sabotage their supplies. Perhaps you were a messenger tasked with crossing dangerous regions where it was better to avoid predators than to fight them. Or you might have been a pickpocket or a spy, using your stealth for unsavory ends.

While others allow their skills to grow organically, you make a point of mastering your skills. As you progress along this path, you have the opportunity to learn more skills and to increase your proficiency with those you have. Think about what environment might have fostered this devotion. Are you a dabbler in many varied skills, or deeply invested in a few key skills? Are you a sage seeking to increase the breadth and depth of your knowledge? Or perhaps you're a charlatan who wants to be able to convincingly adopt many new identities.

Survivor			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:You are tough. You not only stand up to wounds that would fell a lesser adventurer, but also continue to push forward when others would need to stop for rest. You have a deep reserve of health that gives you the ability to recover more quickly than most people. You likely had a harsh life before becoming an adventurer. You might have lived in an extreme environment, such as a tundra or a desert, where survival was a daily challenge. Perhaps you are an escaped slave who had to endure terrible conditions, or a prisoner on the run. Or your exceptional endurance could be supernatural in nature, the result of a fey blessing at your birth or a drop of giant blood in your ancestry.

Swashbuckler		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:Elegant weapons are the mark of a civilized warrior, someone for whom precision and panache are elements of skill, not simple flourishes. Your style is all about fluidity, quick reactions, and being nimble enough to step away when things grow too dangerous. You likely grew up in a city, since weapons such as the rapier are products of a civilized realm. You might also have been trained by a skilled tutor, one hired by your parents or guardian in hopes of teaching you the skills you need to defend yourself.

Two-Weapon Fighter	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Specialty	DESC:The art of fighting with two weapons can be difficult to master, but you have both the grace and the skill to pull off such a complex fighting style. Switching from offense to defense and back again, you keep your enemies unbalanced by striking from two directions at once, weaving your weapons in a complex pattern to turn aside strikes and set up swift counterattacks.
