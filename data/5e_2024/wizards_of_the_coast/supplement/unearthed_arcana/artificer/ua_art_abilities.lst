Select a Large beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The servant uses that beast's game statistics, but it can look however you like, as long as its form is appropriate for its statistics. It has the following modifications: &nl; It is a construct instead of a beast. &nl; It can't be charmed. &nl; It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. &nl; It gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet if it doesn't have it already. &nl; It understands the languages you can speak when you create it, but it can't speak. &nl; If you are the target of a melee attack and the servant is within 5 feet of the attacker, you can use your reaction to command the servant to respond, using its reaction to make a melee attack against the attacker. &nlThe servant obeys your orders to the best of its ability. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own. If the servant is killed, it can be returned to life via normal means, such as with the revivify spell. In addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair a slain servant if you have access to its body. It returns to life with 1 hit point at the end of the rest.
