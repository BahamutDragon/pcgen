It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. Thepromise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually requiredto rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure.Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. Somesavants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single schoolof magic, seeing them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic.Other savants are generous teachers, countering ignorance and deception with deep knowledge and good humor.
