Deflect Attack	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	PREABILITY:3,CATEGORY=FEAT,Power Attack,Sunder,Expertise	PRESTAT:2,STR=13,INT=13	DESC:You can be more aggressive when fighting defensively.	SOURCEPAGE:p.8	BENEFIT:When you are Fighting Defensively, your opponent provokes an Attack of Opportunity just before attacking you. Since you are Fighting Defensively, your Attack of Opportunity has a -4 penalty to attack. If the opponent attacks you with a weapon, your Attack of Opportunity can only be used as a Sunder attack against the weapon that is used to attack you. If the opponent attacks you with an unarmed attack or a natural weapon, you attack the unarmed strike or natural weapon, effectively making an Attack of Opportunity against your opponent. If your attack actually damages the opponent's weapon (or the opponent, in the case of an unarmed strike or natural weapon), subtract the damage dealt to the weapon or opponent from the damage you would sustain from their attack. In this way, it is possible to negate the damage from an opponent's attack.
