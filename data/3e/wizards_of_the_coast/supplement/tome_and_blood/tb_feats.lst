PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Spell Focus in the school chosen.	BENEFIT:Add +2 to your saving throws against spells of the chosen school. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.
Arcane Preparation	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	DESC:You can prepare an arcane spell ahead of time as a wizard does.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:You must be able to cast spells as a bard or sorcerer before you can take this feat.	BENEFIT:Each day, you are able to prepare one or more spells as a wizard does. If you are a sorcerer or a bard, this means that you can prepare a spell with a metamagic feat ahead of time, instead of casting it as a full-round action. The prepared spell remains in your mind and occupies one of your spell slots until you cast it or change it. A prepared spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats.

PRETEXT:Prerequisite:You must be able to cast spells as a bard or sorcerer before you can take this feat.	PRECLASS:1,TYPE=SpontaneousArcaneCaster=1	BENEFIT:Each day, you are able to prepare one or more spells as a wizard does. If you are a sorcerer or a bard, this means that you can prepare a spell with a metamagic feat ahead of time, instead of casting it as a full-round action. The prepared spell remains in your mind and occupies one of your spell slots until you cast it or change it. A prepared spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each time. You can use Energy Admixture to further alter a spell that has already been modified with Energy Substitution. You can also use Energy Admixture to include your chosen energy type with a spell that already uses the same type, in  effect doubling the damage dice.
Energy Substitution	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:You can modify a spell that uses one type of energy to use another type of energy.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Any other metamagic feat, 5 ranks in Knowledge (arcana).	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,TYPE=Metamagic	PRESKILL:1,Knowledge (Arcana)=5	BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can modify a spell with an energy designator to use the chosen type of energy instead. A substituted spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt (see sidebar). A substituted spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times, each time it applies to a different type of energy.	CHOOSE:STRING|Acid|Cold|Electricity|Fire|Sonic	MULT:YES	STACK:NO
Eschew Materials	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:You can cast spells without material components.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Any other metamagic feat.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Feat,TYPE=Metamagic	BENEFIT:An eschewed spell can be cast with no material components. Spells without material components or whose material components cost more than 1 gp are not affected by this feat. An eschewed spell uses up a spell slot of the spell’s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats.
Extra Slot	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:You can cast an extra spell.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Spellcaster level 4th+.	PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=4	BENEFIT:You gain one extra spell slot in your daily allotment. This extra slot can be at any level up to one level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. For example, a 4th-level sorcerer gains either an extra 0-level or 1st-level slot, allowing him to cast any known spell of the chosen level one more time each day. A 4th-level wizard can prepare any extra 0-level or 1st-level spell she knows. Once selected, the extra spell slot never migrates up or down in level. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you gain an extra spell slot at any level up to one level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast.	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE	MULT:YES	STACK:YES	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Extra Spell Slot Choice|1
Extra Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:You can learn one more spell.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Spellcaster level 3rd+.	BENEFIT:You learn one additional spell at any level up to one level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. Thus, a 4th-level sorcerer gains a new 0-level or 1stlevel spell, expanding his repertoire. A 4th-level wizard can likewise learn an extra 0-level or 1st-level spell, but since wizards learn spells far more easily than sorcerers, this feat is of less use to her. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you learn a new spell at any level up to one lower than the highest-level spell you can cast.
Greater Spell Focus	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:Choose a school of magic to which you already have applied the Spell Focus feat. Your magic spells of that school are now even more potent than before.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Spell Focus.	BENEFIT:Add +4 to the DC for all saving throws against spells from the school of magic you select to focus on. This supersedes (does not stack with) the bonus from Spell Focus. Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. It’s effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new school of magic.
Greater Spell Penetration	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:Your spells are especially potent, defeating spell resistance more readily than normal.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Spell Penetration.	BENEFIT:You get a +4 modifier on caster level check to beat a creature’s spell resistance. This supersedes (does not stack with) the bonus from Spell Penetration.
Improved Familiar	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.40	DESC:As long as you are able to acquire a new familiar, you may choose your new familiar from a nonstandard list.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible alignment.	BENEFIT:When choosing a familiar, the following creatures are also available to you. You may choose a familiar with an alignment up to one step away on each of the alignment axes (lawful through chaotic, good through evil).
Innate Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:You have mastered a spell so thoroughly you can now cast it as a spell-like ability.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Quicken Spell, Silent Spell, Still Spell.	BENEFIT:Choose a spell you can cast. You can now cast this spell at will as a spell-like ability once per round, without needing to prepare it. One spell slot eight levels higher than the innate spell is permanently used to power it. If the innate spell has an XP component, you pay the XP cost each time you use the spell-like ability. If the innate spell has a focus, you must have the focus to use the spell-like ability. If the innate spell has a costly material component (see the spell description) you use an item worth 50 times that cost to use as a focus for the spell-like ability. Since an innate spell is a spell-like ability and not an actual spell, a cleric cannot convert it to a cure or an inflict spell. Divine spellcasters who become unable to cast divine spells cannot use divine innate spells. Special: You can choose this feat more than once, selecting another spell each time. You have to pay the costs in spell slots, focuses, and material components for each innate spell you acquire.
Persistent Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:You make one of your spells last all day.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Extend Spell.	BENEFIT:A persistent spell has a duration of 24 hours. The persistent spell must have a personal or a fixed range (for example, comprehend languages or detect magic). Spells of instantaneous duration cannot be affected by this feat, nor can spells whose effect is discharged. You need not concentrate on spells such as detect magic and detect thoughts to be aware of the mere presence or absence of the thing detected, but you must still concentrate to gain additional information as normal. Concentration on such a spell is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
Repeat Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:You can cast a spell that repeats the following round.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Any other metamagic feat.	BENEFIT:A repeated spell is automatically cast again at the beginning of your next turn in the round. No matter where you are, the second spell originates from the same location and affects the same area as the original spell. You cannot use this feat on spells with a touch range. If the original spell designates a target, the repeated spell affects the same target if it is within 30 feet of its original position; otherwise the second spell fails. A repeated spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
Sanctum Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.41	DESC:Your spells have a home ground advantage.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Any other metamagic feat.	BENEFIT:A sanctum spell has an effective spell level one level higher than normal if cast in your sanctum (see Special, below)—but if not cast in the sanctum, it has an effective spell level one level lower than normal. All effects dependent on spell level (such as save DCs or the ability to penetrate a minor globe of invulnerability) are calculated according to the adjusted level. A sanctum spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats. Special: Your sanctum is an area you have previously designated within a 10-foot/level radius from the center. This area can be a particular site, building, or structure. A sanctum can be designated within a larger structure, but its special advantages cut off beyond the maximum area. The designated area must be a site where you have spent a cumulative period of at least three months. Once designated, it takes seven days for the site to become a sanctum. If you designate a new area to be your sanctum, the benefits of the old one immediately fade. You may have only a single sanctum at one time.
Sculpt Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:You can alter the shape of a spell’s area.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Any other metamagic feat.	BENEFIT:You can modify a an area spell by changing the area’s shape. The new area must be chosen from the following list: cylinder (10-foot radius, 30 feet high), 40-foot cone, four 10-foot cubes, or a ball (20-foot-radius spread). The sculpted spell works normally in all respects except for its shape. For example, a lightning bolt spell whose area is changed to a ball deals the same amount of damage, but the lightning ball affects a 20-foot-radius spread. A sculpted spell uses a spell slot one level higher than the spell’s actual level.
Spell Specialization	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:You deal more damage with ray or energy missile spells.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Weapon Focus (ray or energy missile spells), spellcaster level 4th+.	BENEFIT:Your damage-dealing spells that make a ranged touch attack gain a +2 damage modifier. The damage bonus only applies if the target is within 30 feet, because only at that range can you strike precisely enough to hit more effectively. Special: You can gain this feat twice: once for ray spells and once for energy missile spells. Its effects do not stack.
Split Ray	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:You can affect two targets with a single ray.	PRETEXT:Prerequisites:Any other metamagic feat.	BENEFIT:You can split spells that specify a single target and make a ranged touch attack. Only spells that deal damage can be affected by this feat. The split ray affect any two targets that are both within the spell’s range and within 30 feet of each other. Each target takes half as much damage as normally indicated (round down). If desired, you can have both rays attack the same target. A split ray uses up a spell slot of the spell’s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats.
Subdual Substitution	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:You can modify a spell that uses energy to deal damage to deal subdual damage instead.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Any other metamagic feat, 5 ranks in Knowledge (arcana)	BENEFIT:Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can modify a spell with the chosen designator to inflict subdual damage instead of energy damage. The subdual spell works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt. For example, a subdual fireball spell works in the usual way, but the subdual fireball deals subdual damage instead of fire damage. A subdual spell uses a spell slot of the spell’s normal level, modified by any other metamagic feats.
Twin Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:You can cast a spell simultaneously with another spell similar to it.	PRETEXT:Prerequisite:Any other metamagic feat.	BENEFIT:Casting a spell altered by this feat causes the spell to take effect twice on the target, as if you were simultaneously casting the same spell two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the spell (such as targets, shaping an area, and so on) apply to both of the resulting spells. The target suffers all the effects of both spells individually and receives a saving throw for each (if applicable). In some cases, failure of both of the target’s saving throws results in redundant effects, such as a twinning charm person (see Combining Magical Effects on page 153 of the Player’s Handbook), although any ally of the target would have to succeed at two dispel attempts in order to free the target from the charm. As with other metamagic feats, twinning a spell does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling (for example, using an untwinned form of the spell doesn’t negate only half of the twinned spell). A twinned spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
Widen Spell	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Metamagic	SOURCEPAGE:p.42	DESC:You can increase the area of your spells.	BENEFIT:You can alter a burst, emanation, or spread spell to increase its area. Spells that do not have an area of one of these three sorts are not affected by this feat. Any numeric measurements of the spell’s area increase by one-half. For example, a widened fireball spell (which normally produces a 20-foot-radius spread) now fills a 30-foot-radius spread. A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
