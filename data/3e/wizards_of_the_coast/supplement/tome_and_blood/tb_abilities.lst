Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.43	DESC:Acolytes of the skin gain no additional proficiency in any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day			KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Spells per Day							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.43	DESC:At every second level gained in the acolyte of the skin class, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points beyond those he receives from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an acolyte of the skin, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.
Wear Fiend				KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Wear Fiend							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:An acolyte of the skin summons the essence of a fiend to himself and wears it like a second skin. The Ritual of Bonding is painful and not be undertaken lightly. The ritual requires 10 rounds from initiation to completion, and once begun, nothing can halt its progress. The fiendish essence subsumes the caster’s own skin, an agonizing process that deals 1d4 points of damage each round of the ritual—wise candidates keep some cure potions on hand. At the end of the rite, the acolyte’s skin sports an oily, almost unnoticeable sheen. However, as he gains additional levels of the prestige class, his skin darkens, sprouts spikes, and gradually gives the wearer a fiendish visage. The fiendish essence also begins to whisper foul secrets to its wearer, urging him to evil. (The wearer may accept or ignore this advice according to his temperament.) The bonded fiendish skin is for all intents and purposes the character’s own. It grants the acolyte of the skin a +1 natural armor bonus, a +2 inherent modifier to Dexterity, 60-foot darkvision, and the spell-like ability poison once per day as cast by a 16th-level caster. The DM determines the actual nature of the skin, be it demonic, devilish, or some other fiendish creature.
Flame Resistant			KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Flame Resistant							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:At 2nd level, the fiendish skin binds tighter, granting the acolyte fire resistance 20.
Fiendish Glare			KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Fiendish Glare							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:At 3rd level, the acolyte of the skin gains the supernatural ability to unnerve opponents with a ferocious glare once per day. This is not a gaze attack, and the target need not meet the acolyte’s eye. Glaring is a standard action that affects any creature he can see within 100 feet. Opponents must succeed at a Will save (DC  20) or be appalled by the terrible promise of retribution in the acolyte’s eyes, suffering a –2 morale penalty to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for 10 minutes. A creature with 50 or fewer hit points is also stunned for 3d4 rounds, one with 51 to 100 hit points is stunned for 2d4 rounds, and one with 101 to 150 hit points is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A creature with 151 hit points or more is not stunned but still suffers the –2 morale penalty if it fails its saving throw.
Fiendish Knowledge		KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Fiendish Knowledge						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:The fiendish skin whispers promises of great power, and to prove it, reveals a hitherto unknown ability. At 4th and 8th level, the acolyte chooses a bonus feat for which he already meets the prerequisites.
Skin Adaptation			KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Skin Adaptation							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:By 5th level, skin and wearer have grown more comfortable together, as if they had never been separate. The natural armor bonus granted by the fiendish skin increases to +2, the acolyte’s darkvision improves to a 120-foot range, and he can now use poison twice per day as cast by a 16th-level caster. In addition, the acolyte gains an inherent +2 modifier to Constitution.
Cold Resistant			KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Cold Resistant							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:At 6th level, the fiendish skin confers cold resistance 20.
Glare of the Pit			KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Glare of the Pit						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:At 7th level, the acolyte gains the supernatural ability to produce fiery rays from his eyes. Once per day as a standard action, he can project two rays (one from each eye) with a range of 100 feet. He may aim both at one target, or one each at two different targets, by making a ranged touch attack. A ray that hits the target deals 8d6 points of fire damage. If both rays hit the same target, the damage is 16d6.
Summon fiend			KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Summon fiend							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike		SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:At 9th level, the acolyte learns to draw on another power of his fiendish skin. If the skin is demonic, once per day he can attempt to summon a vrock with a 35% chance of success; if devilish, once per day he can attempt to summon a gelugon with a 35% chance of success. The summoned creatures do the acolyte’s bidding but automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A fiend that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. At the DM’s discretion, using this power leaves the acolyte beholden to the summoned fiend.
Symbiosis				KEY:Acolyte of the Skin ~ Symbiosis								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Acolyte of the Skin Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.45	DESC:At 10th level, the fiendish skin and the acolyte are one, and only final death can separate them. His type changes to «outsider», which means (among other things) that he is no longer affected by spells that specifically target humanoids, such as charm person, but he can be hedged out by a magic circle spell against his alignment. Additionally, the acolyte gains damage reduction 20/+1.

# Alienist 
Weapon and Armor Proficiency		KEY:Alienist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:Alienists gain no additional proficiency in any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day				KEY:Alienist ~ Spells per Day							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:When a new alienist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points beyond those he receives from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a alienist, she must decide to which class she adds each level of alienist for purposes of determining spells per day.
Summon Alien				KEY:Alienist ~ Summon Alien							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.SpellLike	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:When an alienist casts any summon monster spell, she summons a "pseudonatural" version of a creature chosen from the appropriate list on page 258 of the Player’s Handbook. For example, by casting summon monster VI, she could summon a pseudonatural rast. This adds the pseudonatural template to the summoned creature (see Pseudonatural Creatures below). If the selected creature would normally be celestial or fiendish, the pseudonatural template replaces that template.
Alien Blessing				KEY:Alienist ~ Alien Blessing							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:An alienist applies a +1 insight bonus on all saving throws, but she permanently loses 2 points of Wisdom.
Metamagic Secret				KEY:Alienist ~ Metamagic Secret						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:The alienist listens to the secret voices whispering from beyond time’s end, and profit thereby. At 3rd and 7th level, she may choose any metamagic feat as a bonus feat.
Mad Certainty				KEY:Alienist ~ Mad Certainty							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:At 4th level, the alienist’s mad certainty in the power of entities beyond the reach of normal space and time lend her an unnatural fortitude. She gains an additional 3 hit points as though from the Toughness feat. However, constantly dwelling on such beings is mentally corrosive, and the alienist’s mind begins to fracture. She develops a phobia against a specified kind of creature, suffering a –2 penalty to saving throws, attack rolls, and Charisma-based skill and ability checks in regard to these creatures. The selected creature gains a +2 morale modifier to AC and saving throws against the phobic alienist. The DM determine the creature feared. Good choices include spiders, snakes, birds, or insects. Beings that share attribute with or those that resemble the selected creature also trigger the phobia.
Pseudonatural Familiar			KEY:Alienist ~ Pseudonatural Familiar					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:On reaching 5th level the alienist’s familiar, if any, gains the pseudonatural template (see Pseudonatural Creatures below) in addition to the powers and abilities normal for a familiar of the appropriate level. This does not replace the familiar— the original slowly takes on pseudonatural aspects, which become fully active at this point. From this point on, newly summoned familiars already possess the pseudonatural template.
Extra Summoning				KEY:Alienist ~ Extra Summoning						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:From 6th level on, the alienist gains one extra spell slot at her highest spell level. This slot can be used only for a summon monster spell. As the alienist becomes able to learn higher-level spells, the extra slot migrates up to the new highest level.
Insane Certainty				KEY:Alienist ~ Insane Certainty						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:At 8th level, the alienist’s mad certainty crystallizes into a truly chilling mania. She gain an additional 3 hit points as though from the Toughness feat, but her phobia likewise intensifies. All penalties and bonuses listed under Mad Certainty for the selected creature increase to –6/+6.
Timeless Body				KEY:Alienist ~ Timeless Body							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:At 9th level, the alienist learns the secret of perpetual youth. She no longer suffers ability penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged (see Table 6-5: Aging Effects on page 93 of the Player’s Handbook). Any penalties she may have already suffered, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, but the alienist is stolen away by horrible entities when her time is up, and she is never seen again.
Transcendence				KEY:Alienist ~ Transcendence							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Alienist Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.46	DESC:At 10th level, the alienist, through long association with alien entities and intensive study of insane secrets, transcends her mortal form and becomes an alien creature. Her type changes to "outsider", which means (among other things) that she is no longer affected by spells that specifically target humanoids, such as charm person, but she can be hedged out by a magic circle spell against her alignment. Additionally, the alienist gains damage reduction 20/+1 and electricity resistance 20. Upon achieving transcendence, the alienist’s appearance undergoes a minor physical change, usually growing a small tentacle or other strange addition or substitution, such as an extra appendage, organ, eye, or enigmatic lump. The alienist can hide this abnormality in a robe or hood, but the alien growth is not under the alienist’s control and sometimes moves, twitches, opens, or otherwise animates of its own accord. Anyone who shares the alienist’s predilection for study of the Far Realms immediately recognizes her transcendent nature, and she gains a +2 circumstance modifier on all Charisma-based skill and ability checks when interacting with such beings. She gains a +2 circumstance modifier on Intimidation checks against all other creatures to whom she reveals her abnormal nature.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Arcane trickster
gain no additional proficiency in any weapon or armor.
Spells per Day: When a new arcane trickster level is
gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had
also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to
before adding the prestige class. He does not, however,
gain any other benefit a character of that class would
have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking
undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points
beyond those he receives from the prestige class, and so
on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.
If a character had more than one spellcasting class
before becoming an arcane trickster, he must decide to
which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining
spells per day.

# 48
Ranged Legerdemain (Su): Using his unique talents,
an arcane trickster can perform one of the following class
skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, or
Pick Pocket. Working at a distance increases the normal
skill check DC by 5, and the arcane trickster cannot take
10 on the check. Any object so manipulated must weigh
5 pounds or less.
The arcane trickster can use ranged legerdemain only
a certain number of times per day as determined by his
level (see Table 3-4: The Arcane Trickster). He can make
only one ranged skill check each day, and only if he has at
least one rank in the skill being used.
Sneak Attack: This is exactly like the rogue ability of
the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6
every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If the
arcane trickster gets a sneak attack modifier from another
source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage
stack.
Impromptu Sneak Attack (Su): Once a day, the
arcane trickster’s unique combination of magical and rogue
skills allows the arcane trickster to declare one melee or
ranged attack the character makes to be a sneak attack
(the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the
impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of
impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to
Armor Class, but only against that attack. The power can
be used against any target, but creatures that are not
subject to critical hits suffer no extra damage (though
they still lose any Dexterity bonus against the attack).
At 7th level, the arcane trickster can use this ability
twice a day.
