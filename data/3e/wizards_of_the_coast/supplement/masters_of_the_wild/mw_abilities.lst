All weapon-related abilities of this prestige class apply only to projectile ranged weapons with which the character is proficient.
Keen Arrows				KEY:Deepwood Sniper ~ Keen Arrows						SOURCEPAGE:p.53	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deepwood Sniper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:At 1st level, all projectiles the deepwood sniper fires behave as ifthey were keen weapons in addition to any other properties they might possess. Thus, a normal arrow fired by a deepwood sniper has a threat range of 19-20 instead of 20. This effect does not stack with any other keen effect .
Range Increment Bonus		KEY:Deepwood Sniper ~ Range Increment Bonus				SOURCEPAGE:p.53	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deepwood Sniper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:With each level the deepwood sniper gains, the range increments of her projectile weapons increase by +10 feet (added after all multipliers) . Thus, a 10th-level deepwood sniper who has the Far Shot feat would have a 280-foot range increment with a heavy crossbow (120 feet x 1 .5 + 100 feet).
Concealment Reduction		KEY:Deepwood Sniper ~ Concealment Reduction				SOURCEPAGE:p.53	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Deepwood Sniper Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary					DESC:When the deepwood sniper reaches 2nd level, her miss chance against opponents with concealment drops by 10%%. Thus, she has a miss chance of 10%% rather than 20%% against an opponent with one-half concealment. Her miss chance drops by an additional 10%% per four deepwood sniper levels she gains thereafter, but this ability never reduces her miss chance against any opponent below 0%%.
