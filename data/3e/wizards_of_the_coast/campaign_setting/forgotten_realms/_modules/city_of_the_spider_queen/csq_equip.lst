Drow Poison						SOURCEPAGE:p.128	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Poison.Drow						SPROP:Drow are renowned for their use of unconsciousness- inducing poison in subterranean ambushes. Drow poison is an Injury (DC 17) poison. Its initial damage is unconsciousness for 1 minute, and its secondary damage is unconsciousness for 2d4 hours. Drow poison costs 75 gp per dose. The dark elves carefully guard the secret of their venom, and it is exceedingly difficult to find it outside of drow realms and outposts.
Amulet of Dark Blessing				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Amulet						SPROP:Made from an iridescent black gemstone found in the Underdark, these amulets are identical in function to the devices surface dwellers know as amulets of Laeral's tears. These drow devices bestow 24 temporary hit points on the wearer. When those temporary hit points have been expended, the amulet crumbles into worthless dust. Caster Level: 12th
Claw of the Revenancer (Minor Artifact)	SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Glove.Minor Artifact.Artifact		SPROP:This fine metal gauntlet covers the back of the wearer's hand and forearm, attaching to the fingers by way of five silver rings and to the wrist by a fine silver bracelet. The claw has three functions: protection, attack, and creating undead. For the purpose of determining how many magic items a character can wear, the claw counts as one ring, one glove or gauntlet, and one bracer. Thus, the wearer can still wear another ring, a single glove (such as a glove of storing), and a single bracelet (such as a bracelet of friends). The claw bestows one negative level on any creature wearing it that does not worship Kiaransalee. This negative level persists as long as the claw is worn and disappears when it is removed. The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the claw is worn. The claw functions as bracers of armor +5 combined with an amulet of natural armor +5, providing the wearer with a +5 armor bonus and a +5 natural armor bonus to AC. When used as a weapon, the claw functions a +1 weapon that deals 1d6 points of slashing damage (critical 19-20/?2) plus 1d6 points of negative energy damage. The wearer is automatically proficient with the claw. Finally, the claw of the revenancer allows the wearer to transform a corpse into an undead creature by touching it. Three times per day, the wearer can create a revenant that serves the wearer of the claw (even if that is not the person who created it) instead of single-mindedly pursuing vengeance against its killer. Commanding the revenant to seek its killer frees it from the wearer's command forever. Once per tenday, the wearer can instead create a silveraith from the corpse of a creature that used magic in life. This ability reflects the claw's intimate connection to Kiaransalee. The wearer of the claw cannot create a revenant and a silveraith on the same day. The undead-creation function of the claw uses the spell trigger activation method, so the wearer must have create greater undead on his or her spell list to use this ability. Caster Level: 20th
Death Spear (Lesser)				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Weapon.Melee.Piercing.Spear.Lesser	SPROP:This +1 longspear is bathed in an aura of negative energy that deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy damage on a successful attack. In addition, the spear can be used to deliver an enervation (lesser death spear) or energy drain (greater death spear) effect on a successful hit. A death spear has 10 charges when created, and each use of a spell effect uses one charge. When drained of charges, the spear retains its aura of negative energy and its enhancement bonus. Caster Level: 7th (lesser death spear) or 17th (greater
Death Spear (Greater)				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Weapon.Melee.Piercing.Spear.Greater	SPROP:This +1 longspear is bathed in an aura of negative energy that deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy damage on a successful attack. In addition, the spear can be used to deliver an enervation (lesser death spear) or energy drain (greater death spear) effect on a successful hit. A death spear has 10 charges when created, and each use of a spell effect uses one charge. When drained of charges, the spear retains its aura of negative energy and its enhancement bonus. Caster Level: 7th (lesser death spear) or 17th (greater
Drow House Insignia				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Amulet						SPROP:This metal token is normally worn on a chain or in a pouch tied around the neck, occupying the same space as a necklace. Each bears a symbol of a noble house from a particular drow city and requires a secret command word to activate. An insignia has a single minor magical ability that can be used once per day, usually a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell. Those belonging to powerful drow often have multiple abilities of various power levels. Typical spells for a house insignia are blur, cat's grace, cloak of dark power, comprehend languages, feather fall, jump, levitate, read magic, scatterspray, shield, spider climb, unseen servant, and water breathing. Each insignia is slightly different, even those from the same noble house, so a person aware of the unique shape of a person's insignia can magically locate that person. Caster Level: 5th
Eyes of the Spider				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Goggle.Eyewear				SPROP:This device fits on the head in such a way that it covers the wearer's left eye. Eight rubies are set into its silver surface, starting directly over the covered eye and rising in a line toward the top of the head. The jagged shape of the item is reminiscent of a spider's legs. A character wearing eyes of the spider cannot also wear a pair of eye lenses or goggles (though he or she can wear a single eye lens, such as a single eye of charming or eye of doom) or a headband, hat, or helmet. When the eyes of the spider are first put on, the device extends a protrusion into the wearer's left eye socket. This causes excruciating pain and deals 2d6 points of damage. Once this occurs, the device cannot be removed until the wearer is dead. Three times per day, the wearer of the eyes of the spider may use a standard action to make a gaze attack identical to the corrupting gaze ability of some ghosts. The range of the attack is 30 feet, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or take 2d10 points of damage plus 1d4 points of Charisma drain. The character gains the benefits of a continual true seeing spell (the divine version) to a range of 120 feet. Because the device also grants all-around vision, the wearer cannot be flanked and gains a +4 bonus on Spot and Search checks. Finally, the eyes of the spider make the wearer immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). Caster Level: 11th
Fang Scarab						SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Amulet.Spider Only				SPROP:A fang-shaped crystal dangles from a loop of finely wrought silver chain in the center of this spiderweb medallion. When the chain is used to wrap the fang scarab around a monstrous spider's waist (the juncture of its cephalothorax and its abdomen), the creature can hear Lolth's dark whispers in its subconscious. This gives it an instinctive knowledge of what the next moment will bring, which manifests as a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls. (This ability does not function during Lolth's silence.) Because the fang scarab is designed for spiders, it's not useful to most adventurers. A nonspider can make a fang scarab function with a successful Use Magic Device check (DC 25), but doing so also fuses it permanently to its user's neck, near the Adam's apple. Nothing short of the wearer's death can then remove it. Though the fang scarab grants its wearer the same attack bonus that it would to a spider, it also initiates a metamorphosis that can change the wearer into a half-spider abomination over time. When the scarab first attaches itself, the wearer's canine teeth enlarge and coarse black hairs appear on the back of his or her neck. No further changes occur until the character attains levels in the fang of Lolth prestige class (fully detailed in Song & Silence: A Guidebook to Rogues and Bards). Caster Level: 5th
Fire Elemental Gem				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Consumable					SPROP:This red or orange gem contains a conjuration spell attuned to the Elemental Plane of Fire. When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a fire elemental (Small, Medium-size, Large, Huge, greater, or elder) appears as if summoned by a summon monster spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem. Caster Level: 5th
Hand of Kiaransalee's Glory			SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Amulet						SPROP:Very similar to the hand of glory described in the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide, this item is a mummified drow hand with a silver ring on each finger. As with the hand of glory, a magic ring placed on one of the fingers (as a replacement for one of the silver rings) functions normally for the character who wears the hand. In addition, each of the five silver rings allows the wearer of the hand to use a specific spell effect. Each ring can produce one of the following effects once per day: deeper darkness, see invisibility, ray of enfeeblement, chill touch, and spectral hand. If the wearer replaces one of the five silver rings with another magic ring, he or she must sacrifice one of these spell effects in order to replace it with the magic ring's power. If removed from the hand, the silver rings have no magical power. Caster Level: 9th
Piwafwi (Lesser)					SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Cape.Cloak.Lesser				SPROP:The dark-colored greater piwafwi is a cloak that has all the abilities of a cloak of elvenkind, and it also provides the benefit of endure elements (fire), negating 5 points of fire damage per round. (Lesser piwafwi are simply cloaks of elvenkind.) Caster Level: 5th
Piwafwi (Greater)					SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Cape.Cloak.Greater				SPROP:The dark-colored greater piwafwi is a cloak that has all the abilities of a cloak of elvenkind, and it also provides the benefit of endure elements (fire), negating 5 points of fire damage per round. (Lesser piwafwi are simply cloaks of elvenkind.) Caster Level: 5th
Ring of See Invisibility			SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Ring						SPROP:This ring allows the wearer to see invisible, astral, or ethereal creatures or objects within 130 feet as if they were normally visible. It does not reveal illusions or creatures that are simply hiding or concealed. Ethereal creatures viewed from the Material Plane appear slightly hazy and unfocused, but the wearer can otherwise see details normally. Caster Level: 3rd
Ring of Silent Spells (Lesser)		SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Ring.Lesser					SPROP:Once per day, this plain silver ring can create a silence effect centered on the wearer. While the silence remains in effect, the wearer can cast up to three spells without verbal components as though using the Silent Spell feat, except that such spells do not require higher spell slots. The ring of silent spells appears in three varieties: a lesser version that affects only spells of 3rd level or lower, a normal version that silences spells of 6th level or lower, and a greater version that affects all spells. Caster Level: 5th (lesser), 11th (normal), or 17th

Robe of Gentle Repose				SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Robe						SPROP:This simple garment is favored by intelligent corporeal undead, particularly liches. It surrounds the wearer with a constant gentle repose effect, preventing all decay of his or her corporeal form. Caster Level: 3rd
Rod of the Twisted Weave			SOURCEPAGE:p.129	COST:	WT:	TYPE:Magic.Rod						SPROP:This rod is a long black scepter with a point at one end. The other end is an intricate design of loosely woven and twisted strands, with raw magical energy glowing pale green in the midst of it, like a burning jet of natural gas. The rod of the twisted Weave functions just like a rod of absorption, automatically absorbing single-target spells or rays (and spell-like abilities duplicating those effects) directed at the possessor or the possessor's gear. However, instead of storing absorbed spell energy, the rod immediately creates a backlash of negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage per absorbed spell level to the caster of the spell (a successful Will save reduces the damage by half). A negative energy protection spell negates this damage, and undead spellcasters are actually healed by this effect. Caster Level: 18th
