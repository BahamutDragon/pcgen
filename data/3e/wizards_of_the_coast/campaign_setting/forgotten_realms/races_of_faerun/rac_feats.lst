This bonus applies on saving throws to fight off ability damage from disease, as well as saving throws against the initial exposure to the disease.

Primitive Caster			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																																DESC:you use screeches, wild gesticulations, and extra maerial components to give your spells additional power																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.167	BENEFIT:This feat only functions when you cast a spell that does not already have a verbal, somatic, or material component. For each component you voluntarily add, you increase the effective level of the spell by +1. You can only add a component that?s not already present in the spell. For example, you can?t add a somatic component to a gaseous form spell, because it already has one. You could add a verbal component, however.  The verbal component you add consists of animalistic shouts, screams, and growls. The DC of Listen checks to hear you cast a spell is ?5 (before modifying for distance). The somatic component is also more complex, so you must have two hands free to add a somatic component with this feat. The extra material component you add with this feat must be a rare plant found in the forest with a successful Profession (herbalist) check (DC 15).

The penalty to AC and bonus on melee attacks apply until your next action. You cannot use Reckless Offensive with ranged attacks.

Runesmith				CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																																					PRESKILL:1,Craft (Rune)=4																																																																																							DESC:You can fashion runes that take the place of material components for your spells																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.167	BENEFIT:You can make runes that take the place of traditional material components for spells you cast. The runes, often carved into stone talismans or stamped onto small plates of metal, cost 1 gp each and have a Craft (rune) DC of 15. Unlike a material component, a rune does not disappear when you cast a spell; having this feat effectively turns a material component required for a spell into a focus.  Your use of runes makes your spells more difficult to counterspell. Other spellcasters who observe you casting a spell take a ?4 penalty on checks to determine which spell you?re casting, unless they also have the Runesmith feat. Spells with costly material components are unaffected by this feat.
Sacred Tattoo			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General												PREDEITY:1,Anhur,Geb,Hathor,Horus-Re,Isis,Nephthys,Osiris,Sebek,Set,Thoth																																																																																																																																																								DESC:You have been spiritually touched by one of the god-kings of the Old-Empire and bear his or her symbol in the form os a tattoo in the shape of a holy symbol																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.168	BENEFIT:Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against spells you cast in an area consecrated/desecrated or hallowed/unhallowed to your deity.

You also get a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities that draw on the magic of the Shadow Weave. These benefits stack with each other.

You get a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance for these schools and spells. These bonuses stack with bonuses from the Shadow Weave Magic feat.
Shield Dwarf Warder		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																		PRERACE:1,Dwarf (Shield)																																																																																																										DESC:You are a student of the protective magics of the shield dwarves, learned at great cost during centuries of warfare and wandering																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.168	BENEFIT:You gain +1 caster level when casting a spell that creates or enhances a suit of armor or a shield.  The tradition of shield dwarf warders includes the following spells at the appropriate levels: 1st-entropic shield, mage armor, shield, shield of faith; 2nd-shield other; 3rd-magic vestment; 4th-fire shield; 6th-stone body; 8th-iron body, shield of law. Other spells gain this benefit if they target a suit of armor or shield.  Additionally, any magic armor or shield you create costs 5%% less gold pieces to make. The experience point cost is unaffected.

Southern Magician			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																		PRERACE:1,Human (FR)																														PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=2,Divine=2							PRETEXT:Mulan human																																																														DESC:Your magical studies in Mulan have taught you spellcasting techniques unknown in the north that blur the line between arcane and divine magic																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.168	BENEFIT:Once per day per two spellcaster levels, you can cast a divine spell as an arcane spell, or vice versa. This enables you to bypass arcane spell failure due to armor, or gain additional benefit from spell that functions differently for a divine caster instead of an arcane caster, such as true seeing or magic weapon.  Spells changed with this feat are often confusing to whosewho haven?t studied Mulan magic. Spellcasters who don?t have this feat suffer a ?4 penalty on attempts to counterspellor dispel this spell, and they must succeed at a caster level check (DC 11 + spell level) to detect the spell with detect magic.  The actual source of the spell?s power doesn?t change, nor does its means of preparation. You are merely weaving the strands of magic together in an unconventional way that makes the spell behave somewhat differently.
Spell-Like Ability Focus	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																																																																																															PRETEXT:Spell-like ability																																																													DESC:Your spell-like ability becomes more potent																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.168	BENEFIT:Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against the spell-like ability on which you focus.

The victim of a staggering strike becomes staggered for a number of rounds equal to one-third the number of dice of damage you choose to forgo. For example, if you could sneak attack for +6d6 damage, you could forgo all that extra damage to stagger the target for 2 rounds.

(This in no way affects or damages the armor.) You cannot use this ability on creatures with the earth subtype. Using this ability is a free action.
Summon Earth Elemental		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																																		PRELEVEL:MIN=6																														PRERACE:1,Gnome (Deep)																																																																																																											DESC:You have developed the ability to summon earth elementals tohelp you with tasks																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.169	BENEFIT:Once per day, you may summon an earth elemental. If acting alone, you may only summon a Small earth elemental. For each additional deep gnome employing this feat in conjunction with you, you may summon an earth elemental one size larger (see the table on Monster Manual page 83). For example, a group of four deep gnomes with this feat can summon a Huge earth elemental, and a group of six deep gnomes can summon an elder earth elemental. Working together in this fashion uses this ability for all involved gnomes for the day.  This is a spell-like ability and is treated as if the characters involved are casting a summon monster spell of the appropriate level, with the exception that they can only summon earth elementals. Unlike the spell, you cannot use this ability to summon multiple elementals at a time.

Up to four creatures of Small size may occupy a 5-foot square (creatures one size category smaller count as half a creature).  When you attack a Medium-size or larger creature with a melee attack, and at least one other ally with the Swarmfighting feat threatens the target, you gain a +1 morale bonus on the attack roll. This bonus increases by +1 for each additional ally beyond the first with the Swarmfightingfeat who threatens the same target. The total morale bonus imparted to your attack roll cannot exceed your Dexterity bonus.
Talfirian Song			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General																									PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=FEAT,Heighten Spell																																					PRERACE:1,Human (FR)																																										PRETEXT:Tethyrian human											PREVARGTEQ:BardicMusic,1																																															DESC:You can use the powerof your bardic music to enhance your illusion spells																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.170	BENEFIT:By expending uses of your bardic music, you can heighten your illusion spells without using higher-level spell slots. For every daily use of your bardic music you expend during the casting of a spell, you can increase the effective level of that spell by +1. For example, you could cast rainbow pattern and expend four uses of your bardic music to make that rainbow pattern effectively an 8th-level spell (increasing the save DC by +4). You can?t raise a spell above 9th level with this feat.
Tattoo Magic			CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:ItemCreation																																																																																					PRESKILL:1,Craft (Calligraphy)=1,Craft (Painting)=1						PRESPELLTYPE:1,Arcane=3,Divine=3																																																																								DESC:You can create tattoos that store spells																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.170	BENEFIT:You can create single-use magic tattoos.  You can create a tattoo of any spell of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets a creature or creatures. Creating a tattoo takes 1 hour, and it must be inked onto a creature with a corporeal body. When you create a tattoo, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a tattoo is its spell level ? its caster level ? 50 gp. To create a tattoo, you must spend 1/25th of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price.  When you create a tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. The bearer of the tattoo is the only one who can activate it and is always the target of the spell. Activating a tattoo requires the creature to touch the tattoo with either hand (the hand does not need to be empty). Activating a tattoo is a standard action that does not draw an attack of opportunity.  Any tattoo that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the tattoo.  Normally, a magic tattoo uses a magic item space on the creature?s body. For example, a creature with a tattoo on one of its hands could not gain the benefit from a magic glove on that hand. Likewise, a creature with a magic tattoo on its back does not receive the benefits of a magic cloak, cape, or mantle. In effect, the magic tattoo is always the first item ?worn? on that part of the body, negating the effects of all other items. A tattoo can be created that does not use a magic item space, but the base price of such a tattoo is double the normal value.  A magic tattoo can be erased with an erase spell as if it were magic writing. Failing to erase the tattoo does not activate it. When a tattoo is activated, the ink pattern or design vanishes from the bearer?s skin.
