Spells					KEY:Adept ~ Spells					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Adept Class Feature					DESC:An adept casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to the cleric, druid, paladin, and ranger), which are drawn from the adept spell list (see below). Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare her spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells. to prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the adept's Wisdom modifier. Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each day at which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells. Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 4-2: The Adept. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, page 8 of the Player's Handbook). When Table 4-2 indicates that the adept gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 0 2nd-level spells for a 4th-level adept), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level. Each adept has a particular holy symbol (as a divine focus) depending on the adept's magical tradition.																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.108

Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. For example, if the target is within a windowless chamber with the door closed, the arrow cannot enter. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).

(A wall of force, a wall of fire, or the like stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally.

It takes one day to make an arrow of death, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The arrow of death lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack).

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class in which he could cast 7th-level spells before he became an archmage, he must decide to which class he adds each level of archmage for the purpose of determining spells per day.

She gains the opportunity to select a special ability from among those described below by permanently eliminating one existing spell slot (she cannot eliminate a spell slot of higher level than the highest-level spell she can cast). Each special ability has a minimum required spell slot level, as specified in its description. For example, a 15thlevel wizard normally can cast two 7th-level spells per day (bonus spells for specialization or high Intelligence can increase this number). A 13th-level wizard/2nd-level archmage who chooses the arcane reach ability forfeits one 7th-level spell slot, and so can only cast one 7th-level spell per day, not counting bonus spells.

For example, an archmage could cast a fireball that deals sonic damage instead of fire damage. This ability can only alter a spell with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The spell's casting time is unaffected. The caster decides whether to alter the spell's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting.

The alteration consists of creating spaces within the spell's area or effect that are not subject to the spell. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. For example, an archmage could cast a fireball and leave a hole where his ally stands, preventing any fire damage. Furthermore, any shapeable spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet.

The archmage does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so and a spell with a costly material component instead costs her 10 times that amount in XP. This ability costs one 5th-level spell slot. The spell-like ability normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level, although the archmage can choose to make a spell modified by a metamagic feat into a spell-like ability at the appropriate spell level. For example, an archmage can make lightning bolt into a spell-like ability by using a 3rd-level spell slot to do so, or into a maximized lightning bolt by using a 6th-level spell slot. The archmage may use an available higher-level spell slot in order to use the spell-like ability more often. Using a slot three levels higher than the chosen spell allows her to use the spelllike ability four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets her use it six times per day. If spell-like ability is selected more than one time as a high arcana choice, this ability can apply to the same spell chosen the first time (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering her helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus (if any). When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level assassin), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a bard does. Upon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, an assassin could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highestlevel sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1stlevel spell. At 8th and 10th levels, he could trade in a single 1stlevel or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level assassin spells) for a different spell of the same level.

In this defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position, such as Move Silently or Jump. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table 6-9). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action. (A defender can't, for example, use the stance when struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution.)

This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the dwarven defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of eldritch knight to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before she became an eldritch knight, she must decide to which class she adds each level of eldritch knight for the purpose of determining spells per day.

(Hierophants who rebuke undead transfer uses of rebuke undead instead.) The transfer lasts anywhere from 24 hours to one week (chosen at the time of transfer), and while the transfer is in effect, the number of turning attempts per day allowed to the hierophant is reduced by the number transferred.

He can transfer any of his druid powers except spellcasting and the ability to have an animal companion. The druid's wild shape ability can be partially or completely transferred. For example, a hierophant may transfer the ability to use wild shape once per day to the recipient and retain the rest of his uses for himself. If the hierophant can assume the form of Tiny or Huge animals, the recipient can as well. As with the imbue with spell ability spell, the hierophant remains responsible to his deity for any use to which the recipient puts the transferred abilities.

Spell-Like Ability						KEY:Hierophant Special Ability ~ Spell-Like Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Hierophant Class Feature.HierophantSelection																																																									DESC:A hierophant who selects this special ability can use one of his divine spell slots to permanently prepare one of his divine spells as a spell-like ability that can be used twice per day. The hierophant does not use any components when casting the spell, although a spell that costs XP to cast still does so, and a spell with a costly material component instead costs him 10 times that amount in XP. The spell normally uses a spell slot of the spell's level (or higher, if the hierophant chooses to permanently attach a metamagic feat to the spell chosen). The hierophant can use an available higher-level spell slot to use the spell-like ability more than once per day. Allocating a slot three levels higher allows him to cast the spell four times per day, and a slot six levels higher lets him cast it six times per day. For example, Lonafin the hierophant wants to be able to create undead whenever he has the opportunity, so he permanently uses a 9th-level spell slot to get animate dead as a spell-like ability usable six times per day. If selected more than one time as a special ability, this ability can apply to the same spell (increasing the number of times per day it can be used) or to a different spell.

Spells per Day/Spells Known					KEY:Loremaster ~ Spells per Day/Spells Known		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Loremaster Class Feature																																																												DESC:A loremaster continues training in magic as well as her field of research. Thus, when a new loremaster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of loremaster to the level of some other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

Spells per Day							KEY:Mystic Theurge ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.MysticTheurge Class Feature																																																											DESC:When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class and any one divine spellcasting class he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of mystic theurge to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic theurge, he must decide to which class he adds each level of mystic theurge for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Spells per Day							KEY:Red Wizard ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.RedWizard Class Feature																																																												DESC:A Red Wizard's training focuses on arcane spells. Thus, when a new Red Wizard level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of Red Wizard to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.

SOURCEPAGE:p.193
Enhanced Specialization						KEY:Red Wizard ~ Enhanced Specialization			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Class Feature.RedWizard Class Feature																																																												DESC:Upon becoming a Red Wizard, a character increases his devotion to his wizard school of specialization. In exchange for this, the Red Wizard must sacrifice study in one or more schools. The Red Wizard must choose an additional prohibited school or schools using the rules in the Player's Handbook. He can never again learn spells from those prohibited schools. He cannot choose the same prohibited schools he chose as a 1st-level wizard. He can still use the prohibited spells he knew prior to becoming a Red Wizard, including using items that are activated by spell completion or spell trigger. For example, Ghorus Toth is specialized in the school of transmutation. His prohibited schools are abjuration and enchantment. When he becomes a Red Wizard, he must choose one other prohibited school. He decides to select conjuration as his additional prohibited school.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.193
Specialist Defense						KEY:Red Wizard ~ Specialist Defense				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Class Feature.RedWizard Class Feature																																																												DESC:A Red Wizard gains a bonus on saving throws against spells from his specialist school.

SOURCEPAGE:p.194
Spell Power								KEY:Red Wizard ~ Spell Power					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Class Feature.RedWizard Class Feature																																																												DESC:At 2nd level, a Red Wizard gains a bonus that increases his effective caster level for purposes of determining level-dependent spell variables and for caster level checks. The bonus starts at +1 and increases at higher levels, as shown on Table 6-15. This ability stacks with other spell power benefits that affect spells from the Red Wizard's specialist school.

Hide in Plain Sight						KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Hide in Plain Sight			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																																									DESC:A shadowdancer can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.195
Evasion								KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Evasion					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																																									DESC:At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage (such as a fireball), she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if the shadowdancer is wearing light armor or no armor.

Uncanny Dodge							KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Uncanny Dodge				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																																									DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a shadowdancer has the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to even be aware of it. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.) If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (such as barbarian or rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).

BONUS:VAR|ShadowIllusionLVL|ShadowdancerLVL																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.195
Summon Shadow							KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Summon Shadow				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																	DEFINE:ShadowCompanionLVL|0																				DESC:At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade (see the Monster Manual for the shadow's statistics). Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow cannot be turned, rebuked, or commanded by any third party. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. Every third level gained by the shadowdancer adds +2 HD (and the requisite base attack and base save bonus increases) to her shadow companion. For example, a 9thlevel shadowdancer can have a shadow companion with 6 HD. If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer loses 200 experience points per shadowdancer level. A successful saving throw reduces the loss by half, to 100 XP per prestige class level. The shadowdancer's XP total can never go below 0 as the result of a shadow's dismissal or destruction. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.

Shadow Jump								KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Shadow Jump				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																	DEFINE:ShadowJumpRange|0	DEFINE:ShadowJumpProgression|0														DESC:At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 20 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 20 feet or two jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (40 feet at 6th, 80 feet at 8th, and 160 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment. (A 6th-level shadowdancer who jumps 32 feet cannot jump again until the next day.)

Defensive Roll							KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Defensive Roll				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																																									DESC:Starting at 5th level, a shadowdancer can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it. Once per day, when a shadowdancer would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), she can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll. If she is in a situation that would deny her any Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't attempt a defensive roll.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.195
Improved Uncanny Dodge						KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																																									DESC:At 5th level, a shadowdancer can no longer be flanked, since she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the shadowdancer. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the shadowdancer can flank her (and thus sneak attack her). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as barbarian or rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.195
Slippery Mind							KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Slippery Mind				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																																									DESC:This ability, gained at 7th level, represents a shadowdancer's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a shadowdancer is affected by an enchantment and fails her saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw. If it fails as well, the spell's effects occur normally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.196
Improved Evasion							KEY:Shadowdancer ~ Improved Evasion				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Shadowdancer Class Feature																																																									DESC:This ability, gained at 10th level, works like evasion (see above). A shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a Reflex saving throw for half damage (breath weapon, fireball, and so on). What's more, she takes only half damage even if she fails her saving throw, since her reflexes allow her to get out of harm's way with incredible speed																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.196

# Thaumaturgist
Weapon and Armor Proficiency					KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Thaumaturgist Class Feature																																																											DESC:Thaumaturgists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.196
Spells per Day							KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Spells per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Thaumaturgist Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																											DESC:When a new thaumaturgist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of thaumaturgist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he became a thaumaturgist, he must decide to which class he adds each level of thaumaturgist for the purpose of determining spells per day.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.196
Improved Ally							KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Improved Ally				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Thaumaturgist Class Feature																																																											DESC:A thaumaturgist is adept at convincing creatures from other planes to do his bidding. When a thaumaturgist casts a planar ally spell (including the lesser and greater versions), he makes a Diplomacy check to convince the creature to aid him for a reduced payment. If the thaumaturgist's Diplomacy check adjusts the creature's attitude to helpful (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72 of the Player's Handbook), the creature will work for 50%% of the standard fee, as long as the task is one that is not against its nature. For example, a 1st-level thaumaturgist negotiating with an initially friendly planar ally that gets a Diplomacy check result of 15 can convince a 6 HD creature to perform a 7- hour task for only 1,500 gp per hour (a 6 HD creature would ordinarily ask for 3,000 gp per hour). The thaumaturgist's improved ally class feature only works when the planar ally shares at least one aspect of alignment with the thaumaturgist. A thaumaturgist can have only one such ally at a time, but he may bargain for tasks from other planar allies normally.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													SOURCEPAGE:p.196
Augment Summoning							KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Augment Summoning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Thaumaturgist Class Feature																																																											DESC:At 2nd level, a thaumaturgist gains the Augment Summoning feat (see page 89 of the Player's Handbook).

Extended Summoning						KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Extended Summoning			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Thaumaturgist Class Feature																																																											DESC:At 3rd level and higher, all spells from the summoning subschool that the thaumaturgist casts have their durations doubled, as if the Extend Spell feat had been applied to them. The levels of the summoning spells don't change, however. This ability stacks with the effect of the Extend Spell feat, which does change the spell's level.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.197
Contingent Conjuration						KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Contingent Conjuration		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Thaumaturgist Class Feature																																																											DESC:A 4th-level thaumaturgist can prepare a summoning or calling spell ahead of time to be triggered by some other event. This functions as described for the contingency spell, including having the thaumaturgist cast the summoning or calling spell beforehand. The spell is cast instantly when the trigger event occurs. For example, a thaumaturgist could use the contingent conjuration ability to summon a barbed devil the next time he is attacked, or call a ghaele eladrin to act as messenger if the king falls ill. The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. If complicated or convoluted condition as are prescribed, the contingent conjuration may fail when triggered. The conjuration spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether the thaumaturgist wants it to, although most conjurations can be dismissed normally. A thaumaturgist can have only one contingent conjuration active at a time.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.197
Planar Cohort							KEY:Thaumaturgist ~ Planar Cohort				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Thaumaturgist Class Feature																																																											DESC:A 5th-level thaumaturgist can use any of the planar ally spells to call a creature to act as his cohort. The called creature serves loyally and well as long as the thaumaturgist continues to advance a cause important to the creature. For example, a 5th-level thaumaturgist could use planar ally to call a bralani eladrin to act as his cohort. As long as the thaumaturgist undertakes quests and missions to fight evil and uphold good, the eladrin will loyally serve. to call a planar cohort, the thaumaturgist must cast the relevant spell, paying the XP costs normally. It takes an offering of 1,000 gp ? the HD of the creature to convince it to serve as a planar cohort, and the improved ally class feature can't be used to reduce or eliminate this cost. The planar cohort can't have more Hit Dice than the thaumaturgist has, and must have an ECL no higher than the thaumaturgist's character level -2. A bralani eladrin has an ECL of 11 (6 Hit Dice and +5 level adjustment), so it might serve as a planar cohort to an 8th-level cleric/ 5th-level thaumaturgist (character level 13th). A thaumaturgist can have only one planar cohort at a time, but he can continue to make agreements with other called creatures normally. A planar cohort replaces a thaumaturgist's existing cohort, if he has one by virtue of the Leadership feat (page 106).
