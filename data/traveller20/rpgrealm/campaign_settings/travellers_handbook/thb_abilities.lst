###Block:
# Ability Name								Description
CATEGORY=Special Ability|3D Spatial Awareness.MOD		DESC:Due to a Belter's years in low or zero gravity environments, the ability to maneuver in three dimensions has become second nature to them.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Academic Lecture.MOD			DESC:The academic may add a +4 synergy bonus when using a related Knowledge skill towards a Bluff skill check rather than the normal +2 synergy bonus, in an appropriate situation.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Ace Evasion.MOD				DESC:Once per round, if the vehicle an Ace is flying is hit for damage, he may make a Pilot skill check (DC equal the attack roll made to hit). If successful, the Ace has managed to evade the attack and the vehicle takes no damage.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Advanced Knowledge.MOD			DESC:The Academic may select one skill from among their Education or Intelligence based class skills to have acquired Advanced Knowledge with. Advanced Knowledge increases the maximum possible skill rank in a selected Intelligence or Education based skill from character level +3 to character level +3 + Education Bonus (any penalty is considered +0 for purposes of this class feature). This class feature may be taken more than once, but each subsequent selection must specify a different skill.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Advanced Research.MOD			DESC:The Academic may add a +4 synergy bonus when using a related Knowledge skill towards a Gather Information skill check rather than the normal +2 synergy bonus.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Animal Specialization.MOD		DESC:The character has studied and learned the habits and tendencies of a specific (named) animal such as Grizzly Bears, or the Greater Crested Tusk-Boar. Requires Species Specialization (for the appropriate animal category). Add +4 to all Tracking and Survival checks when hunting this specific animal.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Animal Whisper.MOD			DESC:While a Barbarian cannot exactly talk to animals, their ability to deal with them sometimes makes it almost appear to be true. In non-combat situations, a barbarian with an Animal Empath skill rank of 5 or more may add a +4 skill synergy bonus to all Handle Animal or Ride skill checks rather than the standard +2 synergy bonus.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Calculating Eye.MOD			DESC:Merchants make their living through the art of the deal, and knowing the potential value of various items and cargo is a large part of the process. Some merchants manage to develop a very Calculating Eye towards this task, and may add +2 to their Appraise skill checks when attempting to appraise the value of common objects and equipment ranging from poor to masterful quality. This does not apply to rare items such as works of art, artifacts, antiques, etc.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Chief Steward.MOD			DESC:Adds 1d3 High, 1d6 Middle, and 1d6+3 low passengers to the number requesting travel aboard ship. Requires the Steward class feature first.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Command Presence.MOD			DESC:The art of using presence and voice to inspire confidence and leadership. Add +2 bonus to all Leader skill checks. This bonus can be stacked with the Natural Born Leader feat.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Contact Specialist.MOD			DESC:The Scout has been trained in the art of first contact, and making a good impression. Add +4 to all initial Liaison or reaction checks when dealing individuals for the first time.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Cross Training.MOD			DESC:The character may select one class feat from the Army, Marine, or Navy class. This class feat may be selected a maximum of two times.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Damage Control.MOD			DESC:Being aboard a fighting naval vessel will usually impart some level of knowledge on the art of damage control, or quickly and effectively instituting temporary but critical repairs when needed. When a character or NPC leading a repair crew has the damage control feat, they may add x2 to the Repair Point multiplier for the team each round.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Defensive Roll ~ Mercenary.MOD	DESC:Once per day, a Mercenary may attempt to roll with an incoming blow to take less damage from it. She makes a Reflex save (DC=stamina damage dealt) and if successful, she only takes half damage (stamina and lifeblood) from the blow. She must be aware or the attack and able to execute this maneuver. If she would normally be denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't try it. Note that the Mercenary's Evasion feature does not apply when attempting a Defensive Roll.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Deliberate Shot.MOD			DESC:Once per combat the Hunter may 'ready' a shot as a free action rather than standard action. For example, a Hunter moves to cover and sets up a deliberate shot allowing him to shoot the next creature to emerge from the nearby lake. Without the feat he could not both move and ready the shot.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Expense Account.MOD			DESC:A reporter has an open expense account equal to Cr5000 per level per month. Expense funds not used one month do not carry over to the next month. If not used they are lost at the end of the month. These funds must be spent on story-related expenses, and the reporter must turn in a detailed expense report at the end of each month to account for its use. Any equipment or other non-consumable/expendable items must be turned into the local TAS bureau office. If the reporter wishes to keep an item bought using the expense account, he or she must reimburse the TAS bureau the full cost. If an expense report is not turned in, the amount spent will be deducted from the next month's expense account.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Evasion ~ Mercenary.MOD		DESC:If exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage (such as a grenade), she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. Evasion can only be used if the Mercenary is wearing light armor or no armor.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|EW Specialist.MOD			DESC:The individual is an electronic warfare expert, and has an incredible talent when it comes to sensors and communications.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Fence Stolen Goods.MOD			DESC:The Rogue knows how to locate buyers for stolen or otherwise illegal goods and products, with a reduced chance of getting caught. An Appraisal check must first be made on the item(s) to determine their value. How quickly the item(s) sell, and how much they bring are all dependent upon one another. The faster an item sells, the less it will likely bring. The higher the asking price for an item, the harder it will be to find a buyer. When checking to see if a buyer has been found willing to pay the asking price, the character must make a Gather Information check vs. the appropriate DC. If the check fails by 10 or more, the legal authorities have learned of the attempt to fence the goods and will try to arrest the character.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|High Morale.MOD				DESC:Marines are known for their high morale and esprit de corps, thus marines with this feat earn a +2 to all Will saving throws.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Improved Search.MOD			DESC:The Rogue is adept at locating the likely spots that someone would tend to hide their valuables and other items of importance, add +2 to all Search checks.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Intuitive Tracking.MOD			DESC:The skilled Hunter eventually develops an 'intuition' when it comes to tracking their prey, often allowing him to pick up a trail even after it has 'gone cold'. In situations where the Hunter fails a P/Hunting skill check while tracking a creature, or in situations where the Hunter would not normally be allowed to make a skill check to pick up the trail of a creature, he may make a Wisdom check (DC15). If successful, he has managed to guess the correct direction the prey has taken.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Jack of all Trades.MOD			DESC:Any class skill (from any class the character has multiclassed into) the character is not currently trained in may be treated as if it were an 'untrained' skill. This means the character may attempt to use these class skills as if they had a skill rank of 0. Each subsequent selection of this class feature improves the character's effective skill rank in these untrained class skills by +1. So a character with JoT +3 would make such skill checks as if they had a skill rank of 3.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Junkyard Dog.MOD				DESC:Some Belters prefer to deal in salvage work rather than prospecting for mineral wealth. With this feat, a Belter automatically earns a 1d8+2 percent 'finders fee' when returning salvaged items owned by a government rather than having to barter for the additional cash as per the normal Salvage rules. When selling salvaged items for scrap, a Belter with this feat is able to command a price equal to 2d6%% of the original value of the item rather than just 1d10%%. This feat will also impart a +2 bonus when using the Appraise skill to attempt to determine the possible value of a salvaged item.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Linguist.MOD				DESC:Exposure and interaction with numerous cultures and societies has imbued the Traveller with a gift for languages. In situations where a Traveller needs to communicate with another, but is unfamiliar with the local language he may still attempt to get a point or question across.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Market Analyst.MOD			DESC:This feature of the Merchant class bestows knowledge of base market values for trade goods, and the ability to predict general sale trends for a specific world. A successful Broker skill check (DC15) allows the first die of the 3d6 to be thrown on the Actual Value Table (see the Trade and Commerce rules in the Travellers' Handbook for details). A second successful Broker skill check (DC30) allows the Merchant to throw the second of the three dice thrown on the Actual Value Table. This result is recorded and kept for use when the cargo is sold, allowing a reasonably accurate assessment of what the final price will be. The third die can never be predicted. The prediction will not hold indefinitely. Once it has expired the prediction is invalid and all Actual Value dice will be rolled normally. Each type of good must be predicted separately, and different lots of the same type must have separate second die roll predictions.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Mental Discipline.MOD			DESC:With a highly trained and analytical mind, an Academic may add +2 to all Intelligence ability checks that require some form of mental agility or problem solving.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Midas Touch.MOD				DESC:Some Belters (the more prosperous ones at least) tend to develop a knack for locating potentially lucrative spots for prospecting. If a strike is made, the Belter may increase the level of the discovery by 1 level of value as per the Prospecting rules if desired.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Narrow Escape.MOD			DESC:Some Merchants (particularly those of somewhat less than sterling reputations) develop a knack for sensing trouble and avoiding it before it spots them, whether it be pirates, local customs frigates, or a navy destroyer. When an encounter with these types of ships occurs, the merchant may attempt to avoid the encounter before it happens. The Merchant will roll 1d20 and add +1 for every 5 or more Merchant class levels he has attained against a DC of 17. If successful, the encounter does not occur.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Natural Medicine.MOD			DESC:While not technologically advanced, Barbarians do tend to have a fair amount of herbal lore and natural remedies available to them when they must deal with injuries and ailments. This feat is similar to the First Aid feat available to anyone, allowing a barbarian to function as if he had a T/Medical skill rank of 0. In addition, it also allows a barbarian to use this skill in a wilderness environment as if he had a proper basic TL5-7 field medical kit at all times. This feat requires a K/Herbal Lore skill rank of 5 or greater.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Negotiator.MOD				DESC:The Scout is a born negotiator. Add +2 to all Liaison and Administration checks.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Noble Indignance.MOD			DESC:Many Nobles are quite adept at using their titles to browbeat and intimidate those of lesser social status into temporary compliance. With this feat a Noble may use their Social Standing in place of their Charisma as the key ability for the following skills: Bluff, Bribery, and Intimidate.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Noble Presence.MOD			DESC:The art of using presence and voice to inspire confidence and leadership. With this feat a noble may use their Social Standing in place of their Charisma as the key ability for the Leader and Liaison skills.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Obscure Knowledge.MOD			DESC:A character may make a special obscure knowledge check with a bonus equal to his level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local world, unusual technology, alien race, or similar type of information. This check will not reveal any specific information, but may give a clue as to where to find more data on the subject, or other lead. The traveller may not Take10 or Take20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Outdoor Survival.MOD			DESC:A Barbarian may add +2 to all Survival skill checks on Thin, Standard, or Dense atmosphere worlds. In addition they may treat the following skills as Untrained skills: Animal Empathy, Handle Animal, Intuit Direction, and Tumble.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Patronage.MOD				DESC:Some Noble families are known for their patronage of the arts or sciences, and tend to impart such an interest in their offspring and focus much of their schooling in these directions.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Opportunist ~ Mercenary.MOD		DESC:Once per round, the Mercenary can make a melee attack of opportunity against an opponent that has just been hit for at least 1 point of lifeblood damage. This attack counts as the Mercenary's attack of opportunity for this round. Even a Mercenary with the Combat Reflexes feat may not make more than one Opportunist attack per round. Note that this feat can only be used in melee combat.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Personal Vessel.MOD			DESC:The character has chosen and in a sense, bonded with, a specific vehicle. When flying this specific vessel the character may add +4 to all piloting and gunnery skill checks. A character may only select one specific vessel per vehicle type (Starship, Small Craft, or Aircraft). A character may select a new vessel as their personal vessel at any time, but the character has only a +2 bonus with either vessel for the first year as they become accustomed to the new vessel and its idiosyncrasies. After a year of transition the character will enjoy the full +4 bonus when piloting the newly selected vessel, and lose all bonuses when piloting the former vessel.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Press Pass.MOD				DESC:Having a valid press pass will gain a reporter access to some areas, people and information not available to the general public, such as the scene of a crime or access to certain governmental records. As a reporter becomes more experienced (and typically more well known) the value of their press pass also grows. For every 2 class levels, the TAS Field Reporter may add +1 to any Bluff or Intimidate skill check when dealing with authorities or company bureaucrats in an attempt to gain access to an area, view documents, or interview someone.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Professional Specialty.MOD		DESC:A Professional may select a specific Entertain, Profession or Technical skill that represents a facet of their profession or how they are most likely to make their living. This class feature may only be selected once.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Pseudo Eidetic Memory.MOD		DESC:Advanced training and practice allows an academic to develop a system of what can occasionally seem like near-total recall. Add +2 to all Knowledge and Education checks when attempting to recall information that has previously been studied, learned, or otherwise become aware of by the character.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Related Field of Study.MOD		DESC:The Academic may select any one non-class Intelligence or Education based skill and make it a permanent class skill. Advanced Knowledge may only be taken once per individual skill.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Second Wind.MOD				DESC:Once per day the character may make a Will saving throw in place of a failed Fortitude saving throw. If the Will save is successful, the character is considered to have made the original Fortitude saving throw anyway. This class feat may be taken more than once, with each subsequent selection adding +1 to the number of times per day this feat may be used.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Self-Reliance.MOD			DESC:When you tend to work out in the middle of nowhere, hours or days from contact with other people, and something goes wrong a certain amount of self-reliance develops. This feat allows a Belter to treat any Technical skill as an Untrained skill.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Skill Focus ~ Knowledge.MOD		DESC:The character has a natural talent. She may select a specific Knowledge skill with which she has a higher than average capability.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Smuggling.MOD				DESC:The Rogue has learned numerous tricks and techniques for hiding contraband and other illegal goods from law enforcement officials and customs officials. Add +2 to all Hide checks when attempting to smuggle anything past such officials.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Sneak Attack ~ Mercenary.MOD		DESC:If a Mercenary can catches an opponent unaware or unable to defend himself (i.e. without their normal Dexterity bonus to AC; attacking from behind, a flank attack, etc.), she may strike for extra damage by targeting a vital spot. If the attack is successful, the mercenary will inflict one extra die of damage. If a critical hit occurs, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can only be a sneak attack if the target is within 9 meters. This class feature may be selected more than once. Each subsequent selection will add 1 extra die of damage to the effects of a successful sneak attack.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Species Specialization.MOD		DESC:The Hunter has studied and learned the habits and tendencies of a general category of animal types such as Pouncers or Grazers. Add +2 to all Tracking and Survival checks when hunting the specified category of animals.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Spot Trouble.MOD				DESC:Most Rogues would prefer to spot trouble before it reaches them, and to this end tend to develop a knack of doing so. This allows a rogue to make a Spot check to detect an ambush, approaching authorities, etc., even when they normally would be unable to do so. In the case of an ambush, the rogue must make an opposed Spot/Hide skill check against the ambushing party. If successful, the Rogue spots the ambush before it can be sprung. If the result is 10 or more higher than the opposing roll, the Rogue spots the ambush before the ambusher spots the Rogue and her party. For most other situations, have the Rogue make a Spot check (DC20) to notice the oncoming trouble before it reaches her. If the result is 30 or higher, the Rogue can avoid the encounter if desired.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Steward.MOD				DESC:Adds 1d3 Middle and 1d6 Low passengers requesting travel aboard ship.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Strategy.MOD				DESC:Requires the Tactics II class feature. With this feat, the soldier may add his Wisdom or Intelligence bonus (whichever is higher) to any initiative rolls or saving throws made by units under his command. Treat any negative ability modifier as +0 for purposes of this feat.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Tactics I.MOD				DESC:With this feat, the soldier may add his Wisdom or Intelligence bonus (whichever is higher) to any small-unit initiative rolls or saving throws. Treat any negative ability modifier as +0 for purposes of this feat. A small unit is a team of combatants numbering from 2 to 12 troops.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Tactics II.MOD				DESC:Requires the Tactics I class feature. The soldier has developed an insight into the tactics involved in maneuvering larger sized battlefield units including both manpower and vehicle assets ranging from platoon to battalion size. The soldier may add his Wisdom or Intelligence bonus (whichever is higher) to the initiative rolls or saving throws for these assets. Treat any negative ability modifier as +0 for purposes of this feat.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|TAS Membership.MOD			DESC:By 7th level, the TAS Reporter has usually done sufficient good work for the bureau that they are rewarded with a free membership in the Traveller's Aid Society.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Trust Fund.MOD				DESC:A modest trust fund is awarded as part of the noble's title that may be drawn upon as needed. This fund is set up in such a way as to allow the noble to draw up to Cr200 x their SOC score in funds per month. For large purchases on credit, the noble's family will usually be willing to guarantee such loans, up to MCr1 x her SOC score, provided she has handled her finances in a reasonable manner previously.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Uncanny Dodge.MOD			DESC:The Mercenary gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or unaware.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Unpredictable Maneuvers.MOD		DESC:When an Ace Pilot is flying a craft, and makes any maneuver that is a Move action, they may add +2 to the AC (not AR) of the vessel against incoming computer (non-gunner) controlled attacks.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Weapon Specialization.MOD		DESC:Weapon Specialization adds a +2 damage bonus with a chosen weapon. The character must have Weapon Focus with that weapon to take Weapon Specialization. If the weapon is a ranged weapon, the damage bonus only applies if the target is within 30 meters, because only at that range can the character shoot precisely enough to hit more effectively.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Well Connected.MOD			DESC:The Years spent Traveling across space ba a Traveller resulted in a multitude of contacts, acquaintances, and friends spread across numerous worlds.
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Technophobia.MOD				DESC:Because of their unfamiliarity with technology, Barbarians are often wary of and have difficulty with items of a technology level of 4 or better, or when using technology related skills (any technical skills, combat engineering, demolitions, driving, forward observer, all knowledge skills, and pilot).
