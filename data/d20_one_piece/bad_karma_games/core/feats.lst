	CATEGORY:FEAT

Once per hour you may choose up to 10 targets and roll your willpower against theirs. If you win, they fall unconscious for the same number of rounds you beat their roll by. So if you beat their roll by 5, they would be unconscious for 5 rounds. If you roll a natural 20 on your roll, every enemy target in the area is affected and they all roll separately to determine the effect length. This effect does not work on characters that are higher than or equal level to you. [Special]You may take this feat more than once. Each time you increase the number of normal targets by a factor of 10. For example, if you take this feat three times, you would affect up to 1000 targets.
