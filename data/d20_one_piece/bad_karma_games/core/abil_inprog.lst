Aquatic Karate Master
Summary: Aquatic Karate are martial arts practiced by skilled members of the Fishman and Merfolk races. While deadly enough on land, Aquatic Karate techniques are truly devastating when used under water. Customized to work with a Fishman's strength and the Merfolk's speed, along with their enhanced underwater mobility and adaptations, these techniques can transform an average Fishman Island inhabitant into a deadly force to be reckoned with.
Prerequisites
Character Level 10, Fishmen or Merfolk Race, 18 STR, Unarmed Strike or Ranged Shot 10 Ranks, No Devil-Fruit Abilities, Greater Flurry of Blows
Prestige Feats
1. WATER SHOT [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:Hurls a simple droplet of water at the target as a standard action. The shot can fly up to 100 ft and deals 2d6 water damage. You must have access to a water source to use this ability. This attack uses your unarmed strike skill even though it's a ranged attack, the target can roll defense normally. If underwater the damage is increased to 3d6.
2. HUNDRED TILE TRUE PUNCH [ DEBUFF ]
	BENEFIT:A full-round, hard punch that can send an opponent flying. When used at close range this special unarmed strike attack deals an extra 1d6 damage and causes your target to be knocked back 20 ft. They can roll a fortitude save with a DC vs 10 + the master's character level to prevent being knocked down. You can also use this attack up to 15ft away from your target, but no damage is applied. Only the knockback or knockdown effects are applied.
3. SHARKSKIN PALM BLOCK [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:A simple palm block with enough force behind it to slap away a sword swing. As a standard action you may use this ability once during one of your opponent's turns. Instead of rolling defense, roll your unarmed strike at a +5 bonus against their attack. If you win, you don't take any damage. The standard action is then subtracted from your next turn.
4. SEA CURRENT LIFTER [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:Takes 3 full rounds (18 seconds) to execute. This ability is an underwater technique which heaves a strong sea current upward, where it erupts from the ocean surface as a towering stream of water. Think of it as a giant water cannon shooting up from the sea, arcing towards your target. The current is so large and powerful it can even lift a small ship and move it over 100ft away. Damage to enemies can vary greatly. This ability can only be used once per day.
5. MIGHTY RELIANT PIERCING [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:This technique shoots a powerful shock wave that pierces through the target's body. This ability is much like Water Shot, however it's much more powerful and it can be thrown up to 1000 ft. It takes a full round action to compress the water in your hands and release it toward your opponent at high speed. You roll your unarmed strike against the opponent's reflex save to determine if it hits. This attack deals 5d6 water damage at 1000 ft. For every 200 ft closer you are, it does an addition 1d6 water damage, up to 10d6. If underwater you can add an additional 2d6 damage to the total.

Assassin
Summary: Assassins are the masters of stealth and instant kills. They stalk their mark, silently waiting for the chance to strike and then pounce killing them in a single, soundless blow. The life of an assassin is an endless test of patience; however it can wield massive power. A single assassin could put an end to a 20-year war with a single stab of their knife. While murder is never a good action to take, many assassins have good intentions. Others however, are just in it for the thrill of the hunt and escape.
Prerequisites
Character Level 10, Evil/Neutral Alignment, 18 DEX, Hide 10 Ranks, Move Silently 10 Ranks, Stealthy, Move Like Lightning

4. ASSASSINATE [ DAMAGE ]

5. GREAT ESCAPE [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:Once per play session, as a full round action, you can attempt to escape from any situation where there is a hiding place. Roll your hide skill with a +5 bonus against every hostile target that is aware of your presence. If you succeed against all of their spot checks, they completely forget about your existence, even if you were in the middle of a battle. If you come out of hiding they will treat you as a new target.
#	SOURCEPAGE:80
Berserker
Summary: Berserkers are fueled by rage and occasionally madness. They rush into battle with little to protect themselves and annihilate their foes without mercy. They shrug off flesh wounds as if they can't even feel them, and continue to slaughter as many enemies as they can before their body gives out. While some berserkers seem perfectly normal in everyday life, every berserker loses control when a battle breaks out and they could even end up hurting their nakama if they stray too close.
Prerequisites
Character Level 10, Neutral/Evil Alignment, 18 STR, Weapon Attack 10 Ranks, 2-Handed Melee Weapons Only, Cannot Wear Medium or Heavy Armor, Greater Rage, Improved Bull Rush
Prestige Feats
1. MUTILATE [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:As a full round action the berserker may attempt to mutilate their target. The berserker does a single weapon attack roll at their maximum bonus with a -5 penalty.

Additionally, for the next 3 rounds, the target cannot perform full-round actions.
2. MADNESS [ STAT BONUS ]

5. JUGGERNAUT [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:This buff may be used once per day as a free action. For the next three rounds, all of your main-hand attack actions are guaranteed to hit your implied target, whether they are normal attacks or abilities which use your weapon attack skill. This effect overwrites anything your opponent might use to defend themselves including the Immortal Guardian feat. This feat will only guarantee that you hit your target, you must still be in normal weapon range to initiate the attack action. You may still roll your attack dice to determine critical and other special triggered effects. If the opponent's nakama attempts to intercept the attack in some way, you throw them up to 30ft in any direction out of the way as a free action. While this buff is applied, the berserker's movement speed is halved.

Brigand
Summary: Brigands are thieves who use teamwork and manpower in order to accomplish their goals. They often form gangs to either take control of a small area or pull off bigger heists then they could ever accomplish alone.

Stealing from a wealthy monarch and sharing the loot with the poor townsfolk, for example.

2. SMUGGLE CREW [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:While you and your allies aren't in combat, you may assist them in moving silently and hiding. This grants them each a +5 move silently and hide bonus. Allies must remain within 20ft of the brigand for this buff to take effect.
3. GANG VIOLENCE [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:A number of gang members appear from random hiding places and attack your opponents. The brigand's gang level is equal to the brigand's level divided by 4.

Every week your guild will send you 1d4 x 100,000 beli for protection. You'll also have a reliable fence to sell your stolen goods to. If the guild is ever attacked, it'll be your responsibility to defend them. If the hideout is destroyed this feat becomes inactive for a month while the hideout is repaired and new thieves are hired.

Fencer
Summary: Fencing style consists of fast cutting techniques coupled with fancy and precise footwork. Fencers are all about one on one duels, constantly pushing their opponents backward. If the fencer misses with an attack, they use that mistake to their advantage and turn it into a second chance to strike. At the end of their training, a fencer can cut their opponent so fast the attack is invisible to the naked eye.
Prerequisites
Character Level 10, 18 DEX, Weapon Attack 10 Ranks, Rapier/Foil/Sabre/Epee Weapon Proficiency, Cannot Wear Heavy Armor, Improved Feint, Uncanny Dodge
1. ADVANCE [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:This tactic is a full round action which moves you a distance equal to twice your land movement speed toward your opponent. During this, your opponent is forced backwards with a fierce set of stabs and slashes. If your opponent refuses to move backwards, or can't, you may attack them with the equivalent of two full-out attacks. Each attack roll takes a -5 to weapon attack and damage due to the fast rate at which you must perform them.
2. SQUIRE [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The fencer inspires a young squire to try fencing and aid him/her in battle. The squire is no match for the fencer's skill, but can add great combat support to any crew. See the Crew Member section for more information.
3. REMISE [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:Once per round, if the fencer misses with an attack, they may attempt a remise as a swift action. A remise is an immediate, direct replacement of an attack that missed or was parried, without withdrawing the arm. To perform a remise, roll your weapon attack at your full skill bonus with a -3 penalty. This essentially gives the fencer an extra attack every round assuming they miss at least once. This effect doesn't work on counter-type attacks, only on attacks you perform during your turn.
4. BLACK CARD [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:As a swift action while dueling one on one with a single target, if a third party begins to intervene you may black card them. This card has a specific pattern on it which hypnotizes the target and causes them to ignore your duel until its completion. The target may attempt to resist the black card's effect by rolling a will save vs a DC of 12 + the fencer's character level. If the black card target is blinded or if one of your allies joins your side of the duel, the effect is nullified.
5. DELAYED SLASH [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:A technique in which the user slashes an opponent at such a fast pace that it appears that they didn't attack at all (in fact, to the casual observer it would look like the user simply walked past the victim). This attack is a full round action in which you casually walk toward and then past your target, not even looking back. During your opponent's next turn they may perform their actions normally but then they take 10d6 damage when their turn ends. You must be within your base movement distance to your target to execute this attack. If they are closer you move past them the excess distance. The target may perform a fortitude save vs a DC of 15 + the fencer's level to take half damage. Delayed Slash can only be used once per battle.

Fiend
Summary: Fiends are godless and depend on the strength of their own bodies to prevail. They are neutral or evil characters who fight for the pleasure of it.

4. VAMPIRIC STRIKE [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:As a full round action you may roll your weapon attack at a -5 against a target who is already bleeding or hemorrhaging. If you successfully hit them, apply your weapon damage normally. Heal yourself for half of the damage dealt to the target, rounded down.
5. SHINIGAMI [ DEBUFF ]
	BENEFIT:As a full round action you may mark a target for death with a ranged touch attack. After 5 rounds, the fiend rolls intimidate against the opponent's fortitude save. The fiend receives a +2 bonus to this intimidate roll if the target is bleeding, and a +4 bonus if they are hemorrhaging. If the fiend wins, the target's HP falls to zero. If the opponent wins, the doom effect is removed. If the fiend is knocked unconscious or indisposed in any way before the doom effect expires, the effect is removed from the target immediately. Doom status cannot be removed by normal means.

Guardian
Summary: Guardians are defensive characters who are arguably the most resilient fighters in the One Piece world.

	BENEFIT:Whenever you are wounded to the point of having zero or less HP, you have a 100%% chance to spontaneously recover to 1 current HP.

HEAVY ARMOR MASTERY [ SKILL BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:Having worn heavy armor all your life you have learned how to clean, repair, and treat it well. You also know every edge, bump, and surface on the armor which you can take advantage of in battle. You gain +1 defense bonus for every piece of heavy armor you're wearing.

Gunslinger
Summary: Gunslingers are the cowboys/outlaws of the One Piece universe. They often dual wield pistols and rely on lightning fast reaction skills and true aim to take down their opponents. Unlike snipers, gunslingers are comfortable rushing into a battle, guns blazing.

As a standard action during your opponent's turn you may roll your reflex save against a DC of 15+2 for every 100ft/sec the projectile is flying to destroy it before it can reach its target. The standard actions you use in this way are subtracted from your next turn.

4. COUNTER REFLEXES [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:Whenever you perform a successful reflex save, you may fire your weapon at the attacking opponent as a free action. Performing a reflex save to avoid a rock slide or other natural event doesn't count for this effect. You may only use this counter attack once per round.
5. BULLET TIME [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:Once per day, as a free action, you may enter a Bullet Time mode. This effect lasts for a full minute in which all of your senses go into overdrive.

You gain a +5 bonus to Spot, Listen, Ranged Shot, Defense, Reflex Save, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks. You also gain an additional standard action each turn; however this additional action cannot be used as a third movement action. This ability can only be used during combat and if you are blinded, it nullifies the effect. The strain on your body to perform this ability causes you to become fatigued once the buff expires.

	BENEFIT:You now have the Lock On ability from the Marksman feat list if you didn't already have it. Attacking your target while using your Lock On ability will now have a 50%% chance to critical. You no longer have a critical range or have a typical critical hit roll, just flip for heads with a coin or roll an even number on a die to determine if the attack is a critical or not.
4. DISARMING SHOT [ DEBUFF ]
	BENEFIT:You aim at your target's weapon or armor and attempt to disarm them of that item. The projectile could knock the sword of out someone's hand or destroy the latch which holds up a breastplate. The DC of this ability depends on the situation and type of item you are trying to disarm. A one-handed club might take a DC of 20 to hit. Two-handed weapons, however, are much harder to disarm and would have a DC around 30. Consult your DM and roll your ranged shot against the given DC.
5. SNIPER SHOT [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:Once per day as a full action you may perform a shot which is inhumanly accurate and devastating to the target. You must already be locked on to the target. The shot travels twice as far as your normal maximum range and deals triple the normal damage of a normal headshot. If you are firing from a far distance (1000ft+) you take a -10 to your ranged shot to account for the wind, air pressure, and other variances which you can't measure.

Storm Lord
Summary: A Storm Lord is someone who has mastered the sciences of electricity and clouds. They can cultivate clouds just like they would a plant, raising them into strong thunder clouds which they can deploy at will to cause devastating attacks. But being a Storm Lord has its good side too, such as bringing rain to a drought stricken island or providing wind for a stranded sailor.
Prerequisites
Character Level 10, 18 INT, Invent 10 Ranks, Must be using a weapon with electric damage, Whirlwind Attack
Prestige Feats
1. TEMPEST [DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:All of the storm lord's normal weapon attacks deal an additional +1d3 electrical damage per 5 character levels.
2. WEATHER BALLS [ CRAFT ]
	BENEFIT:You can now plant and grow your own thunder clouds using special weather balls. Planting a ball successfully takes an invent roll with a DC of 20 and requires good sunlight, a 5x5 patch of dirt, and water. It takes a full day of game time for them to reach maturity. Once popped, the ball will quickly expand growing into a large thunder cloud. Each cloud covers a 30x30ft area and moves with the wind, if any is present. Popping one cloud will cause it to rain and the wind will pick up significantly at ground level.
3. THUNDERBOLT [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:As a full round action the Specialist may summon a thunderbolt from a tempest or weather ball cloud. The Storm Lord may strike anyone within 30ft of the storm. The target cannot dodge this attack but may attempt a fortitude save vs a DC of 22 to take half damage; it deals 2d20 electrical damage.
4. BODY OF A THUNDER GOD [ STAT BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:You now have +10 electrical resistance and a +5 navigation bonus due to your advanced knowledge of weather patterns.
5. THUNDERSTORM [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:As a 2-round action, the Storm Lord may create a thunderstorm above them using 3 weather balls, regardless of the current weather. The thunderstorm covers a 100x100 foot area, centered on the Storm Lord. Each round, roll 1d8 to determine the number of random targets the thunderstorm will strike within its diameter. The random targets can be any characters except the Storm Lord or those standing within the same 5x5 square area as them. This attack cannot strike the same target more than once per round. Each struck target takes 2d20 lightning damage. This storm lasts for 5 rounds and cannot be cancelled.

###Block - Prestige Careers (Level 15)
Admiral
Summary: Admirals are the most powerful government agents in the world. Their strength allows them to handle any situation, including sailing in the New World. When admirals visit an island, its inhabitants flee before them and no one but the strongest pirates in the world dare stand against them. The admiral's most feared weapon is the Buster Call which, with one den den mushi call, can destroy an entire island and reduce it to rubble.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 STR or 20 CON, Vice Admiral, Tough as Nails, Master of the Seas, Moral Justice or Absolute Justice
Prestige Feats
1. SIGNING BONUS [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:When a marine is promoted to the rank of admiral they are offered a Devil Fruit. Since the government hires the best scientists in the world, they are able to determine the fruit's unique powers. The DM should randomly select three devil fruits and allow the admiral to select one of the three. The admiral can then do whatever they want with the devil fruit including eating it, giving it to someone else, or selling it.
2. GOVERNMENT TRAINING [ SKILL BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The admiral gains a permanent +2 bonus to fortitude save, bluff, gather information, knowledge (history), knowledge (nobility and royalty), navigation, sailing, and sense motive.
3. DEATH SENTENCE [ DEBUFF ]
	BENEFIT:Once per day the admiral may verbally declare a death sentence on a target with half or less of their total HP remaining. If the target is struck by the marine with a melee attack during the next three rounds they will immediately drop to -1 HP. This ability will not work on targets of equal or greater character level than the admiral.
4. GRANDMASTER OF THE SEAS [ STAT BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The speed bonus from Master of the Seas feat becomes +3 speed bonus and +3 DR bonus. Additionally, all of the cannons on the admiral's ship gain a +3 damage bonus.
5. BUSTER CALL [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:A Buster Call is an order only admirals have the authority to use. Five vice admirals will lead their ships to the target area and bombard it with cannons until nothing is left. The admiral orders a Buster Call on a 5x5 mile square area. After the call is made, the bombardment will start 15 minutes later. Anyone still in the area takes 2d20 damage each minute they remain in the area. Structures and vegetation in the area also sustain heavy damage.
#	SOURCEPAGE:94
Butcher
Summary: A butcher is both a master of food and combat. They can absorb the abilities of their foes through eating their flesh. Additionally, a butcher's body is perfectly nourished, granting bonuses to their constitution and improving their immune systems. The most impressive ability a butcher possesses is their ability to instantly burn calories to perform inhuman feats of strength and regeneration.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 STR or WIS, Cooking 18 Ranks, Attack Cuisine, Distillery, Brain Food
Prestige Feats
1. FLESH MEMORY [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The butcher may cook and eat the flesh of a non-humanoid source to randomly acquire 1d4 of their feats. For example, eating the flesh of a dragon might grant the butcher the ability to spit fire or grow hard scales. These feats last for 8 hours and cannot be removed or replaced until the time expires (with the exception of the Gluttony feat's side effects). No one but the butcher may gain feats in this way.
2. PRESERVATIVES [ CRAFTING ]
	BENEFIT:The duration of any food or drink the butcher creates will now last twice as long. The Flesh Memory feat duration is not affected.
3. HEALTHY METABOLISM [ STAT BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The butcher gains a +2 bonus to their CON attribute. Additionally, any poison effects which the butcher suffers will wear off in half the normal time.
4. CLEAVER FEVER [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:As a full round action, the butcher may attempt to cleave all of the targets within range of their melee weapon. The butcher rolls their attack normally against all of the targets. Each target that loses the roll takes normal weapon damage and starts to hemorrhage. This attack does not differentiate between friend and foe.
5. GLUTTONY [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:Once per play session the butcher may ingest an extra 100lb of food and, consequently, gain 100lb of weight. While in combat, the butcher may immediately burn these extra calories as a free action for one of the following effects: heal half their total HP, be cured of all disease or poison effects, gain +4 STR, DEX and CON for the remainder of the battle, or move up to 200ft in a straight line. If the 100lb of burned calories are from using the Flesh Memory feat, the random feats gained from the meat are removed.
#	SOURCEPAGE:95
Headhunter
Summary: Headhunters are elite bounty hunters who hunt for pleasure rather than money. They are ruthless killers who stop at nothing to hunt down and kill their targets. They are masters of trap setting, making it almost impossible for their targets to escape. With their cloaking abilities, most of the headhunter's targets never see them coming until their head is already decapitated and flying through the air.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 STR or 20 DEX, Trapping 18 Ranks, Executioner, Camouflage, Natural Footwork
Prestige Feats
1. SIXTH SENSE [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The headhunter now has the inexplicable ability to track down their target no matter where they are hiding in the world. The headhunter experiences this as a gut feeling or hunch. The target of this ability can only be someone whom the headhunter intends to kill.
2. TRAP MASTERY [ SKILL BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The headhunter gains a permanent +5 bonus to their Trapping skill checks.
3. INFRARED VISION [ STAT BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The headhunter can now see heat. They can easily find any warm blooded creature hiding in darkness. The headhunter no longer takes any penalty to actions against living creatures at night or in poor visibility. Smoke, fog, and other vision impairing abilities no longer affect the headhunter. If the headhunter's eyes are damaged, his infrared vision is also impaired.
4. HUNTER'S CLOAK [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:Once per hour, as a standard action, the headhunter can become completely invisible for 12 seconds. The headhunter still makes noise and can affect the world normally if, for example, they step in a puddle. If the headhunter performs or is the successful target of any offensive action, the cloak is removed immediately afterward. A target attempting to avoid an invisible offensive action takes a -5 penalty to their avoidance/defense roll. An indirect offensive action, such as cutting a rope, does not count towards removing the cloak.
5. FORCE OF HABIT [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:When performing a normal attack, the headhunter now has a chance to decapitate their target, if the target's current HP is less than half their total HP. Regardless of the headhunter's critical range, if the headhunter rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll, they decapitate the target. A decapitation does not require a success check; the target immediately dies and cannot be revived. The only way a target can avoid being decapitated is to roll a natural 20 on their defense roll against the decapitation attack. Any nakama of the decapitated target who sees this happen must roll a will save vs DC of 15 + headhunter's level. If they fail, they become frightened for 3 rounds.
#	SOURCEPAGE:96
Maestro
Summary: A maestro is a master of sound and music. They no longer require instruments; they use nature or the orchestra of battle to perform their masterpieces. Their songs and rhythms are richer and have longer lasting effects on those who hear them. And if that wasn't enough, they can even combine their favorite songs, mixing them into a new masterpiece.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 DEX or CHA, Perform 18 Ranks, Battle Anthem, Thunderous Overture, Vexing Verses
Prestige Feats
1. NATURAL RHYTHMS [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The maestro no longer requires instruments to perform their musical feats. Additionally, all of their beneficial songs can now be completed as a standard action. Normal: The majority of the feats a musician can perform require them to have an instrument equipped. Their beneficial songs normally take a full minute to complete.
2. DIRGE [ DEBUFF ]
	BENEFIT:The maestro's offensive songs are now harder to resist. All DC checks against the maestro's offensive songs now gain a +3 to their difficulty.
3. BETTER LYRICS [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:The maestro's beneficial songs now last twice as long on all of those affected by them, up to 30 minutes. Normal: Musician song effects only last 15 minutes.
4. MIX MASTER [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:The maestro can combine any two beneficial songs into a single feat. The two songs must be chosen at the time this feat is taken and cannot be changed. The perform check for this new song has a DC check of 25.
5. REQUIEM [ DEBUFF ]
	BENEFIT:As a full round action, the maestro turns the sounds of battle into a masterpiece of death and destruction. To start a requiem, the maestro must successfully roll their perform against a DC check of 30. The maestro cannot move or perform any actions while performing the requiem and must continue to perform it for at least 5 full turns. All targets within 300ft of the maestro, excluding their nakama, suffer severe penalties including: -5 DR, STR, DEX, WIS, and all secondary skill rolls. Additionally, all duration-based beneficial effects on the affected targets immediately expire. The requiem can be maintained up to 20 turns. If the maestro is knocked prone, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to stand or move their arms at any point, the requiem ends. To clarify, the maestro is not the source of the requiem, so he cannot be found by the sounds of this ability.
#	SOURCEPAGE:97
Mechanic
Summary: A mechanic is a shipbuilder who has moved beyond the means of conventional engineering and has moved into new and more complex systems. Mechanics can build submarines, tanks, cyborgs, and even giant mechanical suits of armor.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 WIS or STR, Engineering 18 Ranks, Luxury Rooms, Offensive Dismantling, Soldier Dock System
Prestige Feats
1. SUBMARINES [CRAFTING ]
	BENEFIT:No longer depending on wind, the mechanic can now build ships which move completely underwater. These metal ships must be built strong to withstand extreme water pressure, but allow crews to avoid most other ships on the sea. See the shipbuilding section for more information.
2. CYBORGIFICATION [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The mechanic can now transform people of any non-cyborg race into cyborgs. This process takes a full day and requires an engineering roll of 30 or higher. If the operation fails, the target falls to 1 HP. If successful, the target loses their current race's bonuses/detriments and instead gains the cyborg race bonuses/detriments. Additionally, they may retroactively gain all of the cyborg implants they would have for their current character level.
3. TANK YOU VERY MUCH [ CRAFTING ]
	BENEFIT:The mechanic can now craft tanks as well as ships. Tanks come in two sizes, large and small. They have the same resource requirements and stats as the submarines of the same size. The only differences between tanks and submarines are that tanks can only travel on land, have cannons instead of torpedoes, and the maximum occupancy is only 3(small) and 5(large).
4. GREASE MONKEY [ SKILL BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The mechanic gains a permanent +5 bonus to all engineering rolls.
5. MECH SUIT [ BUFF ]
	BENEFIT:As a first time requirement to use this feat, a mechanic must first build a mech suit. The mech suit requires the same materials as a small submarine and can have two cannons installed. Additionally, the mech suit can have up to three offensive cyborg implant abilities, and can acquire them without worrying about their prerequisites. The engineering roll to build the suit is a DC of 35. A failure means half of the materials are wasted.
Once built, the mechanic may enter the suit once per play session. The suit has a limited amount of fuel which will refill automatically between each use. However, the maximum operation time is 15 minutes. While in the suit, the mechanic has a DR bonus and a melee damage bonus of +5. They can still use their normal melee weapons and skills while in the suit, as well as the suit's built in cannons and cyborg implant abilities. Additionally, the cyborg implants can be activated in half the normal time. For example, a full round cyborg implant would only be a standard action for the suit to perform. The land speed of the suit is the same as the mechanics', however the suit cannot move underwater.

Meteorologist
Summary: A meteorologist is an expert on the atmospheric conditions around the world. They can predict extended forecasts, alerting them to the weather over the next few days. Additionally, many meteorologists take an interest beyond the planet they live on and begin to study astronomical objects such as meteors. In any case, a meteorologist is always prepared to take on the elements and is a great asset to any crew sailing through tough seas.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 WIS or INT, Navigation 18 Ranks, Shifting Winds, Log Pose, Sky Navigation, Current Master
Prestige Feats
1. EXTENDED FORECAST [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The meteorologist now has a complete understanding of the atmosphere in any area they are exposed to. This allows them to predict the weather and use it to their advantage. As a full round action the meteorologist may "change" the weather of their environment to anything that suits their needs. However, the change must be logical. For example, on a tropical island it wouldn't be possible to predict a blizzard. However, a hurricane-like rain storm, heavy fog, or a heat wave would be possible. Once the forecast is made, it takes an additional 5 minutes for the weather to change accordingly. Natural disasters like earthquakes, meteors, and volcanoes are not predictable with this feat.
2. METEOR [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:As a full round action, the meteorologist predicts the fall of a massive meteor at the target location. The meteor doesn't arrive until the end of the meteorologist's next turn, but the meteorologist is free to perform other actions during their next turn. Anyone within 30ft of the impact takes Xd6 heat damage where X is the meteorologist's character level divided by 2.
3. CYCLONE [ DEBUFF ]
	BENEFIT:As a standard action, the meteorologist predicts a miniature cyclone to trap the target opponent. The target is not trapped until their turn starts and may attempt a reflex save vs a DC of 15 + the meteorologist's character level to escape. If trapped in the cyclone, the target cannot take any actions, even speech. They may only re-attempt the reflex save as a full-round action to escape. If attacked, they break free of the cyclone. The cyclone lasts for 1d4+1 rounds.
4. DRESS IN LAYERS [ STAT BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The meteorologist is now prepared for any weather and dresses appropriately in all of their gear at all times so they can change it easily. Rain coat, parka, shorts, rubber boots, and more are worn at all times. This grants a +5 bonus to heat and cold resistance but the meteorologist suffers a -1 to their DEX. This does not affect the meteorologist's ability to wear armor.
5. METEOR SHOWER [ DAMAGE ]
	BENEFIT:The meteorologist can now predict multiple meteors in the target area. Before using Meteor, the meteorologist may roll a 1d6. The resulting number is how many meteors will fall in the target area. After the initial meteor, an additional one will fall at the end of the meteorologist's next turn, and every turn after, until the number is reached.

Surgeon
Summary: Surgeons are the most skilled doctors in the world. Not only can they heal patients more quickly than amateur doctors, they can perform miracles with their skilled hands. A complete understanding of humanoid anatomy allows them to not only transplant organs, they can aim and strike at their opponent's organs, disabling them. The feat surgeon's are most known for is their ability to revive the dead, done not through magic, but through science and the understanding of how the body functions.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 WIS or INT, Heal 18 Ranks, Advanced Combat Medic, Medical License, Potion Master, Virology
Prestige Feats
1. SURGERY [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The surgeon's Advanced Combat Medic feat is now rolled with 3d10 instead of 2d8 and has a DC of 25. Additionally, the surgeon no longer needs first aid kits. Instead, they use a surgeon's kit which, once purchased, never has to be replaced as long as it's cleaned after each use.
2. TRANSPLANT [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The surgeon can now transplant any organ in the body aside from the brain. Heart, Liver, Kidneys, Eyes, Fingers, almost anything is possible. This action must be done in a sterile area, and the replacement organ must be kept healthy (such as on ice or in a living host). The heal DC of the action varies based on the organ; the DM determines this on a scale between 20 and 40. Once complete, the host gains a bonus based on the previous host and the organ. The previous host and new host of the organ must be within one size category of each other. If the surgery fails, the new organ is lost.
3. SURGEON'S FOCUS [ SKILL BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:The surgeon gains a permanent +2 DEX bonus due to their steady and skilled hands. They also gain a +3 concentration bonus for being able to work under heavy stress and pressure.
4. ANATOMY 101 [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The rules for critical hits change for the surgeon. First, the surgeon's critical range increases by 2. For example, if a weapon has a 19-20 critical range, it will now be 17-20. When the surgeon rolls an attack in their critical range they complete the following steps:
1. The surgeon picks a non-lethal body part of the target to aim for. Examples: Hand, Foot, Eye, Ear, Tongue, Achilles Tendon, etc.
2. The surgeon rolls their critical check against the target's defense to see if the critical is a success, as normal.
3. If successful, the surgeon deals normal weapon damage and the target will begin to hemorrhage. If the surgeon's critical check beat the target's defense by 3 or more, the body part the surgeon was aiming for becomes disabled.
5. REVIVE [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:As a 1-minute action, the surgeon may attempt to revive a dead target. A target who has suffered vorpal damage (such as decapitation or disembowelment) cannot be revived. This action can only be taken within the first 15 minutes after the target has died and can only be attempted five times total. The heal DC for this action is 35 and increases by +1 for each failed attempt on the target. If successful, the target's HP is set to -1.

Tinkerer
Summary: A tinkerer is a scientist who has evolved beyond conventional thinking. Tinkerers push the boundaries on what is safe or practical to invent, and instead take any risks necessary to realize their dream machines. Whether it's creating teleport pads, automated medical stations, or personal shield devices, a tinkerer is unmatched in terms of battlefield support.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 INT or DEX, Invent 18 Ranks, Devil Fruit Research, Minion, Kairoseki Mastery, Mechanical Efficiency
Prestige Feats
1. OVERCLOCKED WEAPONRY [ CRAFT ]
	BENEFIT:The tinkerer may attempt to overclock a weapon using their invent skill. First, the tinkerer decides which type of damage they want to overclock the weapon with (heat, cold, electric, corrosion, or sonic). Next, the tinkerer rolls their invent skill and subtracts 22 from the result. Divide the remainder by 3, rounding down, and that is the amount of bonus damage applied to the weapon. Each weapon can be overclocked once. Ammo cannot be overclocked.
2. WORMHOLE GENERATOR [ CRAFT ]
	BENEFIT:Using some scrap metal, the tinkerer creates a pair of teleport pads. To craft them, the tinkerer must roll their invent skill. Two pads are created with a maximum link distance of the tinkerer's skill roll multiplied by 5ft. The pads are lightweight, small, and linked to each other. They expand once placed on a surface, large enough to cover a 5x5ft area. The pads only activate if both are placed within link distance of each other. Any creature who passes over a pad will be teleported to the other pad's location, without loss of momentum. The pads burn out after the battle is over.
3. REBREATHERS [ CRAFT ]
	BENEFIT:Using 1lb of sea-stone, the tinkerer can now create underwater breathing devices. A devil-fruit user using a rebreather will feel nauseous and lose their abilities, due to the sea-stone, but will not drown if underwater.
4. AUTOMATED MEDICAL STATION [ CRAFT ]
	BENEFIT:Using some scrap metal, the tinkerer creates an automated medical station, which can heal nearby creatures once deployed. To craft the station, the tinkerer must roll their invent skill and divide the result by 5, rounded down. The result is the number of rounds the station will remain active before burning out. It is lightweight and roughly the size of a suitcase. Once deployed, the station will expand outward with mechanical hands, searching for targets within the 10x10ft area to heal. Each creature within range recovers 10%% of their HP at the start of their turn.
5. ENERGY SHIELDS [ CRAFT ]
	BENEFIT:Using some scrap metal, the tinkerer creates an energy shield which protects whoever is carrying it from harm. To craft the shield, the tinkerer rolls their invent skill and multiplies the result by 1d4. This is the amount of damage the shield will absorb before it burns out. It is lightweight and can be attached to clothing or placed in a pocket. The shield will absorb all types of damage, but does not take the host creature's DC into consideration when absorbing damage. For example, if the host is hit for 30 physical damage, the shield will absorb all 30 points before the creature's DC is applied.

Yonko
Summary: A Yonko is a pirate who has become a dominant figure in the New World. They claim hold over at least one island and usually tens, if not hundreds. A pirate cannot become a Yonko without first journeying to the New World and then removing or replacing an existing open Yonko position. There can only be four Yonko at any given time. Once in place, a Yonko gains the benefits of being a ruler including taxes, intelligence networks, and a huge navy of followers.
Prerequisites
Character Level 15, 20 STR or CHA, Diplomacy or Intimidate 18 Ranks, Extra Booty, Hurricane, Enslavement or Pirate Alliance, 4 Yonko Limit - If you take this prestige career and there are four Yonko in existence, you will not gain the new feat abilities until you defeat a current Yonko and take their place.
Prestige Feats
1. PEACE OFFERING [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:When a new Yonko is established, the people of the island present a peace offering in the hopes that the Yonko will favor, protect, and generally treat them well. In this case, the people present a random Devil Fruit.
2. TAXES [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The Yonko now controls the taxes of each island they rule over. Each week the Yonko's treasury will increase by the total island's population multiplied by 10,000 (average weekly income) then multiplied by 0.05 (5%% tax rate) and finally divided by two (half goes back to the people). So an island with a population of 5,000 would provide 1,250,000 Beli per week in taxes that the Yonko can spend freely. If the Yonko lowers taxes, the island's population will grow faster and the weekly income will slowly increase. If the Yonko increases taxes, the population will slowly lower and the average weekly income will diminish over time.
3. INTELLIGENCE NETWORK [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The Yonko now controls an intelligence network throughout the world. Maintaining the network costs 500,000 Beli a week. In return the Yonko will be aware of any major events happening in the world within a day of the event taking place. Any ships approaching one of the Yonko's islands will be spotted and reported long before they can land on shore. Lastly, spies planted in the government will alert the Yonko to any plots which may threaten them.
4. MAKESHIFT NAVY [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:At a onetime cost of 1,000,000 Beli, the Yonko can setup a small navy on a single island they control using the local population. The navy consists of three medium ships and full, but weak, pirate crews to control them. These navies will defend the islands automatically and may be called on by the Yonko at any time to come and assist them. Additionally, any rare or valuable items they plunder will be provided to the Yonko during the next tax collection.
5. ULTIMATE INSPIRATION [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:The Yonko is now known all around the world as one of the strongest pirates in existence. Their influence is so great that they become heroes to some, inspiring them to become pirates. Each week when collecting taxes, a new pirate will enter the New World and offer to serve under the Yonko's rule. This pirate will be level 15 and have a 50%% chance of being a random devil fruit user. The DM will create and control this pirate but the Yonko can order them to do anything.

###Block - Cyborg Implants
# Cyborg implants are only available to the cyborg race. They start with 1 implant at level 1 and gain an additional implant every 4 levels. At level 20 a cyborg character should have 6 implants total. Each cyborg also comes installed with 3 bottles of fuel. Using different implants uses up this fuel but are well worth it.
AIR FILTER [ MISC ]
	BENEFIT:You filter all the air entering your lungs. This destroys any harmful airborne particles like bacteria, viruses, poisonous chemicals, and choking gases/smoke. As a bonus effect you may inhale a large amount of air around you much like a coup de vent, but instead of firing it back out at high speed, you just filter the air so your allies aren't affected by them either. Venting the air around you takes a full turn. This special effect uses up ½ a bottle of fuel. This ability does not prevent poisons or diseases introduced to the body by other means.
BEAM [ DAMAGE ]
	PRETEXT:Hand Cannon
	BENEFIT:You install a small beam cannon into your hand or mouth, allowing you to do a single ranged shot up to 200ft away. This attack is a two-round action and deals 3d6 damage + 1d6 per 5 character levels. At level 20 this attack would deal 7d6 damage. The target of this attack can roll their reflex save vs a DC of 15 + the cyborg's level to take half damage. Each time this is used, it uses up 2 bottles of fuel.
CENTRAL AIR [ MISC ]
	PRETEXT:Air Filter
	BENEFIT:You are comfortable in temperatures most would find unpleasant. Conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit are perfectly fine with you. Normally you would need to make a fortitude save to avoid taking damage at the extremes.
CENTUAR LEGS [ STAT BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:As a standard action the cyborg's legs split apart length wise and spread so that they have 4 skinnier legs. While in this form, the cyborg runs 10ft faster on land per turn. They use up a bottle of fuel every 10 minutes in this form.
COUP DE VENT [ DAMAGE ]
	PRETEXT:Central Air
	BENEFIT:You install an air compressor and valve within your body which can shoot out air at high velocity. As a two round action this can be used to propel targets in a 30ft cone up to 100ft away and deals 2d6 damage to them. They can roll a fortitude save vs a DC of 15 to take half damage. This implant uses 1 bottle per use.
EXTRA BOTTLE [ STAT BONUS ]
	BENEFIT:You gain room for an extra fuel bottle bringing your total up to 4. Special: You may take this implant one more time, increasing your bottle capacity to a maximum of 5.
	CHOOSE:NUMCHOICES=1|NOCHOICE
	MULT:YES
	STACK:YES
FLAIL HAND [ DAMAGE ]
	PRETEXT:Steel Skin
	BENEFIT:You attach a chain to your hand, allowing you to extend your normal unarmed strike attacks up to 20ft away. Each extended attack uses ½ bottle of fuel.
