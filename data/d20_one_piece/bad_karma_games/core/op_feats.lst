DEVASTATING STRIKE	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Brawler Feat.DAMAGE	PRETEXT:Aggressive, Unarmed Strike 15 Ranks	DESC:This attack takes two full rounds to complete. The first full round the brawler will stand completely still, charging the attack. If attacked or distracted the brawler will need to roll concentration vs a DC of 18 to continue. On the second full turn the brawler may charge and attack any target within 30ft. The damage dealt is calculated by rolling the brawler's normal unarmed strike damage and multiplying the result by 5.

The brawler must have enough strength to lift their target. The distance they can throw the target depends on their STR, but it will always be at least 10ft further than a normal character their size could throw. If the brawler is throwing an opponent, the target can attempt a reflex save vs a DC of 15 + brawler's character level to dodge or the target can attempt a STR check break out of the brawler's grip. The target rolls a STR roll at a -5 against the brawler's STR roll. The target can attempt either of these checks when the brawler first captures them, but can only use the STR check during each round the brawler continues to hold them.

SUCKER PUNCH		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Brawler Feat.DAMAGE	PRETEXT:Aggressive, Unarmed Strike 10 Ranks	DESC:The brawler must be behind and flanking their target to use this ability. As a standard action they attack their target with the normal flanking bonus. If successful, the brawler applies damage normally and rolls a 1d4. The result is the number of rounds the target is dazed. The brawler then rolls a 1d4 again to determine how many turns they must wait before they can use this ability again.
UNBALANCE OPPONENT	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Brawler Feat.DEBUFF	PRETEXT:Bodyguard, Defense 9 Ranks	DESC:During the brawler's action, they designate a single target no more than one size category larger or smaller than themselves. That opponent doesn't get to add their STR modifier to attack rolls when targeting the brawler. (If the opponent has a Strength penalty, he or she still takes that penalty.)

HIDDEN DAGGERS	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Marksman Feat.DAMAGE	PRETEXT:Point Blank Shot	DESC:The marksman can now conceal three throwing daggers in their clothing.

SHADOW SHOT		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Marksman Feat.MISC	PRETEXT:Marksman, Ranged Shot 5 Ranks	DESC:As a full-round action the marksman may fire two projectiles in quick succession, the second hidden in the first projectile's shadow.

The user gains a +10 bonus to defense, spot, and sense motive checks. When duration expires you may exit the stance or switch to a different stance as a standard action.

Once per hour you may choose up to 10 targets and roll your willpower against theirs. If you win, they fall unconscious for the same number of rounds you beat their roll by. So if you beat their roll by 5, they would be unconscious for 5 rounds.

This effect does not work on characters that are higher than or equal level to you. [Special]You may take this feat more than once.
