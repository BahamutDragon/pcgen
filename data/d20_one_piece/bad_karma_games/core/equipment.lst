Bubbly Coral			TYPE:Gear	KEY:Bubbly Coral					SOURCEPAGE:121	SPROP:A strange, mysterious device that looks like coral, but has the ability to produce air bubbles when activated. These bubbles can grow large enough to envelope a character's entire body, or small enough to just wrap around their head or other body parts. If it's wrapped around a character's head while underwater, it will supply them with air. The bubbles can also be used on land, where the bubbles can carry heavy weights, such as a merman's body weight so he can float around on land. The larger the coral, the faster and larger the bubbles it can produce. Bubbly coral is produced on Fishman Island and is generally used for the two aforementioned purposes.
Caltrops				TYPE:Gear	KEY:Caltrops						SOURCEPAGE:121	SPROP:A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square. Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to defense. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble. Caltrops may not work against unusual opponents.
