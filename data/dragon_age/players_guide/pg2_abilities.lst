Arcane Warrior				KEY:Class Specialization ~ Arcane Warrior	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.MageClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Mage=1		PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Magic and Dexterity 3 or higher.													DESC:Among the elves of ancient Thedas there was a tradition that fused the arts of magic and combat. Known as arcane warriors, these mages channeled mana to boost their combat prowess. These abilities are thought by most to be forgotten, another casualty of the wars that destroyed the elven homelands. Though hidden, that knowledge does survive. Due to the rarity of this specialization, the GM should consider requiring it to be unlocked (see Unlocking Specializations). Arcane warriors have not been widely seen in Thedas in hundreds of years. Their return should provide great story and adventure material for your campaign.																																																																																																																																																			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Arcane Warrior
Assassin					KEY:Class Specialization ~ Assassin		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.RogueClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Rogue=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Cunning and Dexterity															DESC:Assassins are masters of the art of death. They train to kill using weapons, poisons, and their wits. The most famous assassins are the Antivan Crows. They will kill anyone for the right price, and because of that they hold the real political power in their homeland. There are always those willing to kill for money, so assassins can be found all over Thedas.																																																																																																																																																																																															ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Assassin
Bard						KEY:Class Specialization ~ Bard		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.RogueClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Rogue=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Communication and Dexterity 3 or higher, and Music (novice).									DESC:Bards may seem like simple minstrels and troubadours, but they are much more. A peculiar feature of Orlesian politics, bards act as spies, saboteurs, and sometimes killers (though they usually prefer to leave that to assassins). Intrigue is a way of life in Orlais, so bards are common there but less so in other nations. Worldly people of all nations look twice at any traveling minstrel, which makes life for honest members of that trade more difficult. It is said that King Maric of Ferelden fell in love with an Orlesian bard with tragic results.																																																																																																																																																															ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Bard
Berserker					KEY:Class Specialization ~ Berserker	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.WarriorClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Warrior=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Strength and Willpower 3 or higher.													DESC:Berserkers rose first among the dwarves of the Warrior Caste. They learned to tap into their rage on the battlefield and use it to perform feats of incredible valor. The Avvars learned from the dwarves and from there the berserker tradition spread to all the human nations. The Ash Warriors are the most famous of the human berserkers. They are mercenaries of a sort, but they do not fight for money. Rather, they lend their considerable might to those whose cause they find the most just. They have fought for many kings of Ferelden but they maintain a stubborn independence.																																																																																																																																																											ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Berserker
Blood Mage					KEY:Class Specialization ~ Blood Mage	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.MageClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Mage=1		PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Constitution and Magic 3 or higher.													DESC:The Tevinter Imperium conquered Thedas with Blood magic. Its magisters, it is said, learned the craft from demons. Every mage feels its allure. There is much power to be gained using blood instead of mana. The Chantry, however, forbids the practice and on this they are unequivocal. The vile practices of the magisters led to the Blights, and to the Maker turning away from his creations. Blood mages are maleficarum (singular maleficar, from the ancient Tevene, “one who is depraved”) and the Templars hunt them down. Interestingly, some Grey Wardens have been known to dabble with Blood magic. Many Wardens believe that any weapon that can be used against the darkspawn should be, and that includes Blood magic.																																																																																																																																				ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Blood Mage
Champion					KEY:Class Specialization ~ Champion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.WarriorClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Warrior=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Communication and Strength 3 or higher.												DESC:There are many tough warriors in Thedas, but those that can truly inspire their allies and intimidate their enemies are few. Champions do not just fight; they are a palpable presence on the battlefield. Comrades in arms look to them for strength and courage in the chaos of battle. Foes hesitate and lose heart when facing them. Champions are not unique to any one army or organization. They can be found in all parts of Thedas, and smart commanders recruit as many as possible into their forces when battle approaches.																																																																																																																																																																				ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Champion
Duelist					KEY:Class Specialization ~ Duelist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.RogueClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Rogue=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Dexterity and Perception 3 or higher, and Dual Weapon Style (novice).							DESC:Heavily armed and armored warriors may dominate the battlefield but duelists rule the streets and alleys of cities like Denerim and Val Royeaux. In such conditions the quick blades and wits of duelists count for more than raw strength. They eschew cumbersome shields and fight with a weapon in each hand instead. They have even developed a weapon set customized for their style of fighting. The classic duelist fights with a rapier and either a main gauche or a spiked buckler in their off-hand, though some pride themselves on fighting with more unusual weapon combinations.																																																																																																																																																											ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Duelist
Spirit Healer				KEY:Class Specialization ~ Spirit Healer	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.MageClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Mage=1		PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Communication and Magic 3 or higher.													DESC:While demons are the most notorious denizens of the Fade, other spirits reside there as well. These spirits are more benevolent and do not have the driving desires that make demons so evil. Spirit healers are those rare mages who learn to communicate and summon such spirits. There is danger in this path, as there always is when the Fade is involved. Sometimes demons pretend to be kindly spirits and the spirit healer pays a dreadful price. When the summoning is successful, however, a spirit healer is capable of healing feats beyond the bounds of normal magic. This is why spirit healers believe the risk is worth it.																																																																																																																																																			ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Novice Talent ~ Spirit Healer
Templar					KEY:Class Specialization ~ Templar		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:ClassSpecialization.WarriorClassSpecialization																		PRECLASS:1,Warrior=1	PRETEXT:Requirement: You must have Magic and Strength 3 or higher.													DESC:The Templars are the militant arm of the Chantry. Their primary functions are to watch over the Circle of Magi and hunt down apostates and maleficarum. For more information about Templars, see Chapter Five: Magic. As noted there, Templars are given small amounts of lyrium to awaken and maintain their special powers. Hard and fast rules for this are not provided, as tracking such things is tedious. The Templars’ use of lyrium makes excellent story fodder, however.

DEFINE:Talent_Arcane_Warrior|0	DESC:You have learned a potent mix of magic and melee skills.	DESC:&nl;Novice: You learn a new weapon group of your choice, and you can use Magic to satisfy the minimum Strength requirement of weapons. You can also enter Combat Magic mode by taking an activate action. While in this mode, you add Magic instead of Strength to your damage with melee weapons. However, any spell you cast in Combat Magic mode has its mana point cost increased by 2. You can end Combat Magic mode with another activate action.|PREVARGTEQ:Talent_Arcane_Warrior,1	DESC:&nl;Journeyman: You reduce the strain of any armor you wear by 3 (see Spells and Armor on page 48 of the Set 1 Player’s Guide).

This is called a Fade Shroud and it gives you a ghostly countenance that is obvious and unsettling to many. A Fade Shroud increases your Defense by 3 but you must pay 3 mana points per round (at the start of your turn) to maintain it. If you do not, the effect ends immediately (though Combat Magic mode remains active).|PREVARGTEQ:Talent_Arcane_Warrior,3																																																ASPECT:NAME|Arcane Warrior Talent (Novice)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Arcane_Warrior,1	ASPECT:NAME|Arcane Warrior Talent (Journeyman)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Arcane_Warrior,2	ASPECT:NAME|Arcane Warrior Talent (Master)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Arcane_Warrior,3

With an activate action you can mark for death a visible target within 10 yards of you. All ranged and melee attacks against a target marked for death receive a +1 damage bonus. The mark lasts until the end of the encounter, the target is slain, or you pick a new target with another activate action. You can’t have active marks on multiple targets at the same time.

First, you must use the activate action to enter the Blood Magic mode. When casting a spell in this mode, you can inflict 1d6 penetrating damage on yourself and you gain mana points equal to the damage. The mana points so generated must be used on the spell you are casting this round; any excess are lost. You can use this mana to cast spells from any school but you must be in Blood Mage mode to cast Blood spells. While in this mode, you cannot be healed with potions or Creation spells. You can end Blood Magic mode with another activate action.|PREVARGTEQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,1	DESC:&nl;Journeyman: You can use the blood of a willing ally to power your spells.

You can pick a target with 6 yards of you and attempt to use their blood as a minor action. Success requires an opposed test of your Magic (Blood) vs. the target’s Willpower (Faith or Self-Discipline). If you win things work as per the journeyman degree. If the target is adjacent to you and helpless (unconscious, tied up, etc.), you inflict 2d6 penetrating damage (and perhaps understand why mages of the Tevinter Imperium were not so popular).|PREVARGTEQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,3																		ASPECT:NAME|Blood Mage Talent (Novice)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,1	ASPECT:NAME|Blood Mage Talent (Journeyman)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,2	ASPECT:NAME|Blood Mage Talent (Master)|PREVAREQ:Talent_Blood_Mage,3

To cast it and other Spirit Healer spells (that is, spells requiring you to have the Spirit Healer specialization), you must first enter Summoning mode.

Affliction Hex		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Vulnerability Hex			SOURCEPAGE:p.64	ASPECT:Magic School|Entropy	ASPECT:Spell Type|Attack	ASPECT:Mana Cost|7 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|14	ASPECT:Test|Magic (Entropy) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|You curse a visible target within 30 yards and all other foes within 10 yards of your target. Until the end of the encounter, those affected by the affliction hex have a –2 penalty to all tests against Spellpower. A primary target who makes a successful Magic (Entropy) test against your Spellpower suffers only a –1 penalty and completely negates the effects on the secondary targets. Secondary targets may also make Magic (Entropy) resistance tests to negate their own penalties entirely, but their individual successes or failures only affect themselves. It doesn’t matter whether a given target is a primary or secondary target of an affliction hex; additional castings of the same spell while the original casting’s duration persists have no effect on the target (see Stacked Spells and Effects).
Arcane Shield		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Arcane Bolt				SOURCEPAGE:p.64	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Defense	ASPECT:Mana Cost|4 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|14	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You create an arcane aura around you that deflects attacks.

This ally must have blood (no golems, for example). You gain 1 Health for each 1 Health lost by your ally, up to 25. This can result in the subject’s death, if reduced to 0 Health. The subject of a blood sacrifice recovers the lost Health normally.
Blood Wound			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Blood Mage specialization		SOURCEPAGE:p.65	ASPECT:Magic School|Blood	ASPECT:Spell Type|Attack	ASPECT:Mana Cost|8 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|17	ASPECT:Test|Constitution (Stamina) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|You make the blood of all enemies within 12 yards of you boil, causing excruciating pain. All targets take 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage and must make a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower. Those that fail can only take a minor action on their next turns. Targets without blood or some similar substance are not affected by this spell. Golems are not affected, for example, while wild sylvans are affected through their sap. Insubstantial and incorporeal targets like shades and ash wraiths are also not affected.
Death Magic			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Drain Life				SOURCEPAGE:p.65	ASPECT:Magic School|Entropy	ASPECT:Spell Type|Enhancement	ASPECT:Mana Cost|7 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You draw upon the residual life force of the dying to replenish your own. Any living creature that dies within 6 yards of you while this spell is active heals damage to your Health equal to the creature’s Constitution, with a minimum of 1. It cannot bring you above your unwounded Health, however. Death magic lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. This spell and death syphon are mutually exclusive, and cannot be maintained at the same time. Casting one cancels the other.
Death Syphon		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Walking Bomb				SOURCEPAGE:p.65	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|7 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You draw upon nearby entropic energy to replenish your own mana. Any living creature that dies within 6 yards of you while this spell is active restores a number of your spent mana points equal to the creature’s Magic, with a minimum of 1. It cannot bring you above your normal full complement of mana points. Death syphon lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability. This spell and death magic are mutually exclusive, and cannot be maintained at the same time. Casting one cancels the other.
Decompose			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Entropy Magic (Journeyman)		SOURCEPAGE:p.66	ASPECT:Magic School|Entropy	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|One Minute	ASPECT:Target Number|12	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|By tracing mystic glyphs over the subject, which may be any single piece of non-living organic material, you speed up the natural process of its decay. Once your casting is finished, every second that passes is the equivalent of a day for the subject. So in a minute’s time, it decays as if two months have passed. In an hour, it decays nearly ten years! This continues until the object is reduced to dust. You can halt the decomposition with a glyph of preservation, but the subject decays some ten months in just the time it takes to cast that spell, and if the glyph of preservation wears off the accelerated decay continues where it left off, at the same rate. Decompose can’t be dispelled; its effects are permanent
Dispel Magic		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Spell Shield				SOURCEPAGE:p.66	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|8 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|17	ASPECT:Test|Magic (Spirit) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|You remove all magical spell effects from a chosen visible target within 25 yards of you. Roll a test of your Magic (Spirit) vs. the Spellpower of any affected magic. Success means you remove that magic. Failure means you do not remove that magic, as it is too powerful. Make a single roll for all magic affecting the target; you may remove some effects and not others, based on their varying Spellpowers. The Gamemaster may rule that some magical effects not from spells can be affected by dispel magic, in which case an effective Spellpower is assigned to represent the effect’s resistance to being dispelled.
Dream Sending		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Sprit Magic (Journeyman)		SOURCEPAGE:p.66	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|7 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Five Minutes	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You send a dream across the Fade to a particular subject, who must be known to you. When the subject next dreams, it will be the dream you have sent. You can script the general events of the dream, including things like conversations, but you do not become aware of the subject’s reactions and are not truly interacting with them. You can use a dream sending to carry a message or convey information, or to display imagery meant to incite emotional reactions. Generally, the content of a dream sending cannot be longer than an hour or so. While the dream may influence the subject’s decision making (providing a particular omen or key piece of information, for example) it does not exert any direct power over the subject’s mind or will. Dream sending does not work on subjects that do not dream, such as dwarves or the Tranquil.
Elemental Mastery		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Primal Magic (Master)		SOURCEPAGE:p.66	ASPECT:Magic School|Primal	ASPECT:Spell Type|Enhancement	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You strengthen your ties with the primal forces of the elements. For one minute, you add +2 to the damage of any Primal attack spell you cast. This includes damage dealt through an intermediary object, as with flaming weapons and frost weapons. You can extend the spell’s duration when you cast it by spending an additional 4 MP per additional minute you would like it to last.
Fade Shield			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Arcane Shield				SOURCEPAGE:p.66	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Defense	ASPECT:Mana Cost|6 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|Shifting partway into the Fade enhances your arcane defenses. For one round, your Spellpower increases by +2 and your Defense becomes equal to your Spellpower. You can extend the spell’s effect when you cast it by spending 2 MP per additional round you would like it to last.
Flaming Weapons		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage										SOURCEPAGE:p.66	ASPECT:Magic School|Primal	ASPECT:Spell Type|Enhancement	ASPECT:Mana Cost|6 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|The readied melee weapons of all allies within 10 yards of you burst into flames, and inflict an additional 1d6 damage with each successful attack. The flames last for one minute; you can extend this duration when you cast the spell by spending an additional 3 MP per additional minute you would like it to last. This spell does not harm the weapons it affects and may be cast on frost weapons.
Force Field			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Mind Blast				SOURCEPAGE:p.67	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Defense	ASPECT:Mana Cost|10 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|18	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You surround a subject within 25 yards (which may be yourself) with a protective field of magical force that absorbs all damage that would otherwise affect its target. The force field lasts for one round. During that time, the subject is completely immune to damage, but also cannot move from the spot (the force field is immobile), make melee or ranged attacks, or give or receive any items. Spells and other effects that do not cause direct damage, such as daze, mana drain, or vulnerability hex, still affect the subject normally, and spells pass out of the force field normally. You can extend the spell’s effect when you cast it by spending 5 MP per additional round you would like it to last.
Frost Weapons		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Winter’s Grasp				SOURCEPAGE:p.67	ASPECT:Magic School|Primal	ASPECT:Spell Type|Enhancement	ASPECT:Mana Cost|6 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|The readied melee weapon of all allies within 10 yards of you exude freezing cold, inflicting +2 penetrating damage with each successful attack. The freezing cold lasts for one minute; you can extend this duration when you cast the spell by spending an additional 3 MP per additional minute you would like it to last. This spell does not harm the weapons it affects and may be cast on flaming weapons. Only the additional damage is penetrating.
Glyph of Preseveration	CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:None							SOURCEPAGE:p.67	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|1 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Five Minutes	ASPECT:Target Number|10	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You draw a faint glyph on the surface of the subject, which can be any piece of dead organic material. The spell arrests the process of decay for the material, keeping it as fresh as it was when the glyph was inscribed for a month. A glyph of preservation can be renewed during its duration, which extends its affects for another month. When the glyph expires the process of decay begins again from where it left off. The spell is used to preserve foodstuffs, to preserve corpses (for lying in state or dissection), or to protect valuable items made of wood, paper, or leather.
Glyph of Sealing		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:None							SOURCEPAGE:p.67	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|3 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|One Minute	ASPECT:Target Number|11	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You touch any object that closes, from a door or gate to a jar, drawing a faint glyph that connects its two surfaces. Once the glyph of sealing is complete, the object is held closed and only you or someone you designated when casting the spell may open it. For anyone else, the only way to open the seal is by breaking whatever it is inscribed upon, whether smashing open a jar or breaking down a door. The glyph lasts until the object is opened, after which it must be recast to seal the object again (assuming it is not destroyed in the process).
Glyph of Warding		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Glyph of Paralysis			SOURCEPAGE:p.67	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Defense	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You trace an arcane glyph on the ground where you stand with your hand or staff. Allies within 3 yards of the glyph of warding gain a +2 bonus to Willpower tests and their Defense against ranged attacks so long as they remain within the glyph’s area. A glyph lasts until the end of the current encounter. You can maintain a number of different glyphs of warding equal to your Magic at any one time (although this does not allow the effects of multiple glyphs of warding to stack on the same target).
Grease			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Spell Wisp				SOURCEPAGE:p.68	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|7 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|Dexterity (Acrobatics) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|You create a slick of grease covering an area up to 10 yards in diameter anywhere within 30 yards of you. Anyone within the slick when it is cast, anyone entering the area, and anyone who moves within the area must make a successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) test against your Spellpower or fall prone at each of those times, as they apply. Prone characters may crawl normally. The grease created by this spell is flammable; contact with fire ignites it, immediately causing 1d6 penetrating damage to everyone in the area. A grease fire burns for rounds equal to your Magic before burning out (which expends the grease), and those inside the area take 1d6 penetrating damage on their turn each round until they exit it. A slick that is not burned persists indefinitely, dispersing only in rain, when appropriately provisioned characters scour it away, or in similar conditions.
Group Heal			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Spirit Healer specialization	SOURCEPAGE:p.68	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|3-9 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|A number of subjects equal to twice your Magic and all within 10 yards of you regain 1d6 Health per 3 MP spent on the casting (maximum: 3d6 Health for 9 MP). You may choose to make yourself one of the subjects of the spell.
Heroic Aura			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Heroic Offense				SOURCEPAGE:p.68	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Defense	ASPECT:Mana Cost|6 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|This spell surrounds a subject within 30 yards with an arcane aura that deflects incoming attacks. The subject gains a +2 bonus to Defense for the rest of the encounter. You can cast this spell on yourself. Its effects do not stack with those of spells that reset your Defense to be based on your Spellpower, such as Arcane Shield and Fade Shield.
Horror			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage										SOURCEPAGE:p.68	ASPECT:Magic School|Entropy	ASPECT:Spell Type|Attack	ASPECT:Mana Cost|8 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|17	ASPECT:Test|Willpower (Self-Discipline) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|You overwhelm a visible target within 20 yards with a blast of sheer terror. Until the target succeeds on a Willpower (Courage) test vs. your Spellpower, they can do nothing but cower in fear. A target failing the initial test may try again at the start of each of their turns.
Invigorate			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Mana Drain				SOURCEPAGE:p.68	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Enhancement	ASPECT:Mana Cost|4 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|14	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You emit waves of mana, bolstering your allies. Allies within 10 yards of you get +1 SP whenever they generate stunt points. You may spend 1 MP at the start of each of your turns to extend the effects for another round; otherwise they end at the beginning of your turn.
Levitate			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage										SOURCEPAGE:p.68	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|Strength (Might) vs. Magic (Spirit)	ASPECT:Description|You exert telekinetic force to move an inanimate object as though it were motivated by an invisible pair of hands. When you cast levitate, split your Magic score as you wish between the effective Dexterity and Strength the object will have as you manipulate it. Neither can be assigned a value less than 0. If your Magic is negative, both are automatically 0. You must be able to see the object in order to manipulate it; the spell ends if it moves out of your vision. You cannot levitate anything that is both aware and able to animate itself (such as most creatures and characters). You can move a levitated object with a Speed equal to your (Magic × 3) with a minimum of 1. If you try to wrest an object from someone’s grasp, its holder may resist by making an opposed Strength (Might) vs. Magic (Spirit) test. If successful, your spell ends immediately. You may spend 1 MP at the start of your turn to maintain this spell for another round, otherwise it ends at the start of your turn. Once the spell is cast, moving the object is typically a minor action, unless you do something like attack with a levitating weapon, in which case it is a major action. Attack rolls are based on the Strength or Dexterity you assigned when you cast the spell (depending on the type of weapon or object being animated), save that you use your Spirit focus rather than the relevant weapon focus. Most objects do damage as improvised weapons. Weapons do their regular damage if you have that weapon group; otherwise they do improvised damage.
Life Ward			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Spirit Healer specialization	SOURCEPAGE:p.69	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|16	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You weave a protective ward around one ally within 6 yards of you, or around yourself. The first time the target’s Health drops below 10 in this encounter, they immediately regain 2d6 Health. Life ward only works once per casting and it ends at the end of the encounter if not triggered. A character cannot have more than one life ward on them at the same time.
Lighting			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Shock					SOURCEPAGE:p.69	ASPECT:Magic School|Primal	ASPECT:Spell Type|Attack	ASPECT:Mana Cost|6 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|16	ASPECT:Test|Constitution (Stamina) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|A bolt of electricity leaps from your outstretched hand or staff to strike a single target within 30 yards. The bolt inflicts 2d6 + Magic penetrating damage. Targets who make a successful Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower take 1d6 + Magic penetrating damage instead.
Mana Cleanse		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Mana Drain				SOURCEPAGE:p.69	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Defense	ASPECT:Mana Cost|7 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|17	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You use your own mana to block that of other casters. For the duration of the encounter, if someone spends mana points in a 16-yard radius of you, you can spend your own mana points to negate their spell on a 1-for-1 basis. For example, if another mage spends 4 MP to cast a spell within 16 yards of you, you can spend 4 MP to negate that spell. If you do not have enough mana points to counter the entire cost, your spell has no effect. This spell does not reveal which spell the other mage is trying to cast; only how many MP are being spent to fuel it.
Memory			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Mind Blast				SOURCEPAGE:p.69	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|6 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|16	ASPECT:Test|Willpower (Self-Discipline) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|You touch a target and cause them to either forget or recall a specific memory. You can remove a memory within a number of hours of the event in question equal to your Magic, but the spell can restore a memory of any age, so long as it is the memory of an event the subject actually experienced. The subject makes a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test against your Spellpower to resist losing a memory, but there is no test to restore a lost memory. The GM decides on the appropriate length of the affected memory, but it should generally concern a single incident or experience no longer than the caster’s Magic in hours (and likely much less).
Paralyze			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Weakness					SOURCEPAGE:p.69	ASPECT:Magic School|Entropy	ASPECT:Spell Type|Attack	ASPECT:Mana Cost|7 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|16	ASPECT:Test|Constitution (Stamina) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|Ghostly wisps of entropic energy surround an opponent within 30 yards. A target failing a Constitution (Stamina) test vs. your Spellpower is paralyzed, completely unable to move, while a successful test means the target’s Speed is cut by one-quarter (rounded in the target’s favor). Both effects last for the rest of the encounter. A paralyzed target gets a new test at the start of his turn each round. Paralyzed characters lose the Dexterity bonus to their Defense and can obviously take no actions, but are not subject to a coup de grace unless they are otherwise unconscious or dying.
Rejuvenate			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Heal					SOURCEPAGE:p.70	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You channel regenerative energy to an ally within 10 yards. The subject regains 1d6 Health immediately, and another 1d6 Health at the start of his turn each round for a number of rounds equal to your Magic ability.
Repulsion Field		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Force Field						SOURCEPAGE:p.70	ASPECT:Magic School|Spirit	ASPECT:Spell Type|Defense	ASPECT:Mana Cost| MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|16	ASPECT:Test|Strength (Might) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|This spell surrounds you with a field of energy that pushes foes away from you. Every other round, at the end of your turn, beginning on the round you cast the spell, a wave of repulsive energy surges out. Enemies within 6 yards must make a successful Strength (Might) test vs. your Spellpower or be pushed 4 yards away from you and knocked prone. To maintain this spell you must spend 1 MP at the start of each of your turns, even on the rounds when no wave surges out. You may not cast this spell twice in order to generate a wave each round.
Revival			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Spirit Healer specialization	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time| Action	ASPECT:Target Number|14	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|Your touch helps to restore the fallen. A dying subject adjacent to you immediately regains 10 + their Constitution + your Magic in Health. Since dying characters cannot take actions, you cannot cast this spell on yourself.
Shape Earth			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Creation Magic (Journeyman)	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|6 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|15	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You can shape and move a mass of sand, earth, or even stone within 6 yards. The spell allows you to move earthen materials with an effective Strength equal to twice your Magic. The materials do not levitate, but are pushed or pulled along the ground. The GM determines how fast objects can be moved based on their mass and your effective Strength. You can also mold objects as if they were soft clay, shaping them as you direct. The GM may require a Magic (Creation) test if you want to finesse a particular result, especially if any fine detail is involved. To maintain this spell you must spend 1 MP at the start of each of your turns. Once you stop maintaining the spell, the materials stay where they are, subject to the usual natural forces (like gravity). Shaped stone will typically retain its new shape, so long as it is capable of supporting its own weight.
Shelter			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Primal Magic (Novice)		SOURCEPAGE:p.70	ASPECT:Magic School|Primal	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|2 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|Major Action	ASPECT:Target Number|12	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|A glyph traced upon the earth with hand or staff creates a faintly shimmering dome, up to 6 yards across and up to 3 yards high at the center. The environment within the dome is cool, dry, and comfortable regardless of the weather outside. Rain, snow, and other minor debris (including falling leaves, ash, or smoke) are kept out, though fresh air can penetrate the dome, and smoke—such as from a campfire— can escape. The shelter’s barrier is of no use whatsoever in combat. You can control the light level within from shade (slightly darker than the outside) to lit as brightly as by a lantern. The shelter lasts for up to 12 hours, or until you dismiss it. You can only maintain a single shelter at a time.
Spring			CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Creation Magic (Journeyman)	SOURCEPAGE:p.70	ASPECT:Magic School|Creation	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|4 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|One Minute	ASPECT:Target Number|13	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|Tracing magical glyphs on natural earth or stone, then striking them with your hand or staff, you cause a spring to burst forth from the spot, pouring out water at a rate of your Magic in gallons per minute. The water is fresh, clean, drinkable, and entirely mundane—it pours and evaporates naturally. If the spring forms in a hollow, it fills to become a pool. You may stop the flow of the spring at any time. Otherwise, it lasts a number of hours equal to your Magic before stopping of its own accord.
Weather Weaving		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Primal Magic (Master)		SOURCEPAGE:p.71	ASPECT:Magic School|Primal	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|8 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|One Hour	ASPECT:Target Number|16	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|You shape and direct the weather in an area with a radius equal to your Magic in miles. You can choose any natural weather condition normally possible in the area for the given time of year (so you cannot make it snow in the middle of summer, for example, or rain in the desert). The weather forms within eight hours of your casting, so generally only limited changes are possible. You can make it warmer or colder by about 20 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degree Celsius), cause it to rain or snow (or stop doing so), or make the sky overcast or clear. Multiple castings (and expenditures of mana) over multiple days can extend the spell’s effect, creating more dramatic shifts in the weather. Note that you do not control the weather from moment to moment. Once you have set it in motion, it follows its natural course.
Wind Weaving		CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Primal Magic (Novice)		SOURCEPAGE:p.71	ASPECT:Magic School|Primal	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|5 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|One Minutes	ASPECT:Target Number|14	ASPECT:Test|None	ASPECT:Description|wish, with force up to a stiff gust: strong enough to blow out candles and other small open flames, and to scatter light debris like leaves or paper. You can direct the wind for up to an hour, although changing its direction or intensity requires a major action each time you do so. Among other things, wind weaving is used to propel sailing vessels without the need to rely on the oftenfickle nature of the weather, and to calm winds that might otherwise prove disruptive.
Wrack				CATEGORY:Spell		TYPE:Spell.Mage	PRETEXT:Requirement: Blood Magic Specialization		SOURCEPAGE:p.71	ASPECT:Magic School|Blood	ASPECT:Spell Type|Utility	ASPECT:Mana Cost|3 MP	ASPECT:Casting Time|One Minute	ASPECT:Target Number|13	ASPECT:Test|Willpower (Self-Discipline) vs. Spellpower	ASPECT:Description|You extend faint tendrils of entropic energy into the target of this spell, which must be within 2 yards while it is cast. So long as you concentrate you can inflict terrible, wracking pain on the subject at will. The victim must make a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower to resist answering your questions or capitulating to your demands. A victim wracked by pain suffers a –3 penalty to all tests while it persists, though suffers no damage from the spell. You cannot have more than one wrack spell active at once. Wrack is a favored spell for interrogation, as it causes no real physical harm and leaves no signs or marks. Some victims injure themselves, and someone with a weak constitution may die from prolonged use, but otherwise it is far safer and more effective than conventional methods of torture. Tales of this spell and its use are one of the many reasons people fear blood mages and their powers.
