The animal understands your spoken commands and follows them to the best of its ability. Though you may specify the type of animal, the Game Master is the arbiter of what type of animals are available to answer. Summoned animals do not fight to the death and are likely to flee when they've lost more than half of their Health (at the GM's discretion) unless you succeed on a Communication (Leadership) test to keep the beast around, or the animal succeeds on a Willpower (Morale) test. The TN of these tests depends on how dire the situation is but should rarely be less than TN 13.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Journeyman Talent ~ Creation Magic

A burst that sends enemies flying into a wall inflicts 1d6 damage if the wall is wood and 2d6 damage if the wall is stone, for example. The GM determines what damage, if any, is applied. Those that make the test are not moved but are still knocked prone.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Spell,Fist of the Maker	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Class Specialization ~ Force Mage

Affected weapons inflict bonus damage equal to your Magic ability. Any attack made with an affected weapon that generates stunt points may treat the Pierce Armor stunt as costing 1 fewer SP. (This can be combined with other effects, such as the level 2 Rogue stunt bonus, to reduce the cost of the stunt to 0 SP.) The enchantment lasts for one minute, but you can extend the duration when you cast the spell by spending an additional 6 MP for each extra minute you would like it to last. This spell does not harm the weapons it affects and may be cast on weapons currently subject to the spells frost weapon and flaming weapon.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Spell,Force Field

You must touch a target's forehead and concentrate for one minute, during which time the target makes a Willpower (Self-Discipline) test vs. your Spellpower. If they succeed, you fail to penetrate their mind but you may spend another 5 MP to extend the casting time by another minute and force the target to make the test again. Once a target fails the test, you have access to their mind and may expend 2 MP to ask the Game Master for the target's honest answer to a single question. You may ask a total number of questions equal to your Magic ability, at a rate of one question per minute. This spell is often quite painful for the target even though it deals no actual damage. Special: To cast this spell, you must use the Blood Mage talent (see Set 2). This is not optional; blood is required!	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Class Specialization ~ Blood Mage

Giant spiders from the Set 1 Game Master's Guide and drakes from the Set 2 Game Master's Guide are examples of vicious beasts appropriate for this spell. GMs may create similar stats for others. It is beyond the power of this spell to grant the caster the form of creatures like high dragons or varterral.	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Class Specialization ~ Shapeshifter
