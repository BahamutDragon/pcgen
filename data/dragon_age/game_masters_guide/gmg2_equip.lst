# Equipment Name			Type							Special Property
Bull's-Eye Arrow			TYPE:Magic.Temporary Magic Item		SPROP:One who takes an aim action when using one of these magical arrows receives a +3 bonus to a subsequent attack roll, rather than the regular +1 bonus. The enchantment on each missile is good for one shot, but the enchantment is not used up until the aim bonus is actually used to make an attack roll. That is, it is not used up if a subsequent attack is not made, or if a Bull'seye Arrow is fired without a preceding aim action (and then collected to be fired again later).
Healing Potion			TYPE:Magic.Temporary Magic Item		SPROP:Similar to but more potent than a Lesser Healing Potion, a Healing Potion is made from healing herbs enchanted with Creation magic. Imbibing a Healing Potion requires an activate action and restores up to 4d6 + Con lost Health.
Ink of Splendor			TYPE:Magic.Temporary Magic Item		SPROP:The lyrium contained in this single bottle of ink renders it capable of changing colors both as and after it is applied in order to illuminate, both beautifully and helpfully, even the simplest of messages. It provides a +3 bonus to Dexterity (Calligraphy) and Cunning (Cartography and Writing) tests to scribe information. Construction plans drawn up with Cunning (Engineering) are easier to carry out. Workers following such plans gain a +2 bonus to relevant tests. A full batch of this ink produces 12 uses; roll 2d6 to determine how many uses remain in a bottle found in the course of play.
Lyrium Potion			TYPE:Magic.Temporary Magic Item		SPROP:Similar to but more potent than a Lesser Lyrium Potion, a Lyrium Potion contains a small amount of refined lyrium. Imbibing a Lyrium Potion requires an activate action and restores up to 2d6 + Magic lost mana points.
Paints of Warding			TYPE:Magic.Temporary Magic Item		SPROP:These war paints, when applied in fearsome patterns to the face of a combatant so that their enemies can see them clearly in battle, provide a +5 bonus to Armor Rating for as long as they are not washed or worn away. (One who goes to great pains to preserve them might see them last for as long as a week.)
Potion of Fortune and Skill	TYPE:Magic.Temporary Magic Item		SPROP:Anyone drinking one of these potions at the beginning of a battle receives two extra Stunt Points (so, 1d6+2 SP) each time they roll doubles for the duration of the fight. Potions of this type go by many different names.
Seeking Torch			TYPE:Magic.Temporary Magic Item		SPROP:These torches provide typical light, but their flickering illumination also seems to bend around obstacles and even shines through opaque objects to find that which is otherwise hidden from sight. Those who search by the light of a Seeking Torch-even in broad daylight- gain a +3 bonus to Perception (Searching) tests. Each torch burns only long enough for a single test.

### PEMANENT MAGIC ITEMS
Aeducan Family Shield		TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:These silverite medium shields, typically pitted and scarred by the claws of countless darkspawn, all bear the ancient seal of the dwarven House Aeducan. Most are also shaped like the seal. They are indestructible by normal means and give a magical +1 bonus to their wielder's Armor Rating.
Antivan Longbow of Fidelity	TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:This whitewood longbow is decorated in the style common in Antiva, and is easy to mistake for one of the many masterwork and superior-but non-magical- bows crafted in that land. In addition to its non-magical benefit, its magical nature is that it cannot be stolen or taken from its owner by either guile or force. Weird circumstances, strange and unforeseen decisions, and even the outright defiance of physical laws always conspire to make sure it remains in the possession of the one who rightfully owns it.
#Masterwork Benefits: Attack Bonus: +2; Damage Bonus: +0
#Superior Benefits: Minimum Strength: -1
#Talent Level Bonus: One level Focus Benefit: No
#Short Range: 33 yards Long Range: 78 yards


Blackened Heartwood Staff	TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:This wood-and-iron quarterstaff was once made of mahogany heartwood, but no more. The corrupting presence of darkspawn during one of the Blights has twisted and tainted it so that it is no longer possible to tell where the wood ends and the metal begins. Even so, a bit of its ancient magical power remains. A mage holding it gains a +2 bonus to his Spellpower when casting Entropy spells.
Blades of House Aeducan		TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:These longswords are a collection of ancient blades that have been carried by Warrior Caste dwarves who have been of, allied with, or sponsored by House Aeducan since the time of the First Blight. These silverite blades are ancestral heirlooms handed down over generations. Folded with lyrium, they are extremely durable and especially resistant to the corrupting nature of darkspawn. They provide a +1 magical attack bonus and are indestructible by normal means.
#Masterwork Benefits: Attack Bonus: +1; Damage Bonus: +0.
#Superior Benefits: Minimum Strength: -1 Talent Level Bonus: One level, Focus Benefit: Yes

The Channel of Entropic Might	TYPE:Ring.Magic.Permanent Magic Item	SPROP:This ring is a powerful channeler of entropic magic. A mage who wears it gains a +2 bonus to their Spellpower when casting spells of the Entropy magic school. Similar magic items exist for the other schools of magic as well, though not all take the form of rings.
The Felon's Coat			TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:This heavy leather drakeskin armor fits anyone who wears it like a second skin and provides the wearer deft and speedy movement. It gives a magical +1 bonus to all Dexterity (Acrobatics, Initiative, and Stealth) tests.
#Masterwork Benefits: Armor Rating: 5
#Superior Benefits: Armor Penalty: 0
Key to Orzammar			TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:These ceremonial keys to the city of Orzammar are diplomatic boons, granted by the vote of the Assembly to acknowledge those who have performed significant services to the city. In addition to granting a +3 social benefit (see The Social Benefits of Masterworks and Superior Items) among dwarves and a +1 social benefit among others familiar with dwarven culture, the magical nature of these keys also gives those who carry them the option to subtract one from their dragon die when making any Communication test. This option may be exercised-or not-after the dice have been rolled. (Its beneficial effect is to make doubles more likely, thereby giving their owner a greater likelihood of generating roleplaying stunt points.)
Oak Brank				TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:Said to have been harvested from a sentient tree in the Brecilian Forest, this quarterstaff feels warm to the touch and gives its wielder the sense that it's alive, ever shifting and moving beneath the fingers. It allows a mage who holds it the option to add ï¿½1 (their choice) to any result rolled on the table of magical mishaps. (This modification does not affect the Willpower test roll, only the magical mishap table result, even though the latter is based on the dragon die result that informs the former.)
#Superior Benefits (as veridium): Talent Level Bonus: One level; Focus Benefit: No
Wolf-Killer				TYPE:Magic.Permanent Magic Item		SPROP:The story of this ironbark longbow's creation has been lost. Though it appears not to have been crafted by a mage's hand and no trace of lyrium can be detected within it, it has the uncanny habit of sending its shafts through the hearts of the beasts it is used to hunt. Whenever a shot fired from Wolf-killer generates stunt points it also inflicts a free (0 SP) lethal blow stunt in addition to the normally selected stunts.
#Superior Benefits: Minimum Strength: -1	Talent Level Bonus: One level Focus Benefit: Yes Short Range: 39 yards Long Range: 104 yards
