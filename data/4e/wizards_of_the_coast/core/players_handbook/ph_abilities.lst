### Basic Attacks adds the Melee Basic Attack and Ranged Basic Attack.  Each class should add it.
### Not sure if it could also be used to somehow add each of the other attacks.  i.e., Strength,
### Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma attacks.  The way I have it now
### for these attacks:  A weapon named "Attacks" that has eight SPROP entries, one for each attribute,
### one for an Implement bonus, and one for Implement Crit bonus.  I buy the "Attack" weapon for
### each character, and equip it.  There must be a better way...

###
### I have a major difference in the categories for many of these abilities when compared to the tutorial.
### I think that ANY ability that is listed as a class feature in the PHB should appear here as a
### "Class Feature" ability.  Anything not listed as a class feature (e.g., Implements), should be appear
### here as a "Special Ability".
###
### Having this breakdown allows each class to have entries like this:
###
### 1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Cleric Proficiencies
### 1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Cleric Abilities
### 1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Cleric Features
###
### Or even one entry:
###
### 1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Cleric Proficiencies|Cleric Abilities|Cleric Features
###
### Some of the classes omit the Abilities line (e.g., Fighter).  The Proficiencies entry is exactly like
### the entry in the tutorial.  The Abilities entry has all class abilities not listed as Class Features,
### and the Class Features entry has all of the abilities designated as Class Features.  Seems like using
### the methodology in the tutorial some of the Class Features would not be listed as Class Features
### in PCGen.

# Features shared by more than one class
Channel Divinity									CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Cleric Class Feature.Paladin Class Feature												VISIBLE:YES																											DESC:Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers, such as turn undead and divine fortune. Some clerics learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats in Chapter 6 grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers. Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.
Prime Shot										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Ranger Class Feature.Warlock Class Feature																																								DESC:If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target.

Daily and Utility Spells: Your spellbook also holds your daily and utility spells. You begin knowing two daily spells, one of which you can use on any given day. Each time you gain a level that lets you select a daily spell or a utility spell, choose two different daily spells or utility spells of that level to add to your book. After an extended rest, you can prepare a number of daily and utility spells according to what you can cast per day for your level. You can't prepare the same spell twice. If you replace a spell because of gaining a level or through retraining, the previous spell vanishes from your spellbook and is replaced by the new spell. Capacity: A typical spellbook has 128 pages. Each spell takes up 1 page. A ritual takes up a number of pages equal to its level.
