# Spell Name			Classes of caster	Type		Components		Casting Time		Range				Target Area or Effect						Duration					Save Info		Spell Resistance				Description
Animal Messenger			CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:10gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:5			TARGETAREA:Non-hostile Tiny animal				DURATION:Special				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Nature check			DESC:You target a nonhostile Tiny animal, such as a sparrow, a raven, a fox, or a carp. The animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, you whisper a message of up to 25 words to the animal and name a recipient and a location. The animal bounds off toward the location, in search of the recipient. The animal avoids danger along its path. Upon finding the recipient, the animal approaches until it is adjacent to the recipient, and then your whisper issues from the animal's mouth, conveying the message.  When the animal delivers its message or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends and the animal reverts to its natural behavior.  Your Nature check determines how long the animal is affected by the ritual.
Arcane Lock				CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:25gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:One Portal						DURATION:Until defeated			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You lock a door, a window, a gate, a portcullis, or some other means of ingress. You can open the door normally, but those who don't have your permission to use it find it locked.  Your Arcana check, with a +5 bonus, sets the DC for Thievery checks or Strength checks made to open the door.  You can set a verbal password, designate up to ten specific individuals, or you can describe categories of creatures that may pass.  The Arcane Lock remains until you dismiss it, the door is destroyed, or until the ward is defeated, such as by the Knock ritual or a successful Strength or Thievery check.  Wherever you are, you instantly know if your Arcane Lock is defeated by one of these methods.
Brew Potion				CLASSES:ALL=5	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:Special	CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:One Potion						DURATION:Until drank			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:You create a potion or an elixir (see page 255) of your level or lower. The ritual's component cost is equal to the price of the potion or the elixir you create.
Commune with Nature		CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:140gp		CASTTIME:30 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:Nature Spirits					DURATION:10 minutes			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Nature check			DESC:By communing with primal spirits of nature, you can learn a number of facts about your immediate environs (within 1 mile of you).  You can ask a number of questions, based on the result of your Nature check, about the terrain features, plants, minerals, bodies of water, creatures, and other aspects of your surroundings.  The primal spirits you communicate with are honest but sometimes can be elusive. Most questions are answered with a yes or a no. Rarely do the spirits elaborate further, and when they do, their response is cryptic.
Comprehend Language		CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:10gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:When beginning the ritual, choose a language you have heard or a piece of writing you have seen within the past 24 hours.  Using this ritual on a language you have heard allows you to understand it when spoken for the next 24 hours and, if your Arcana check result is 35 or higher, to speak the language fluently for the duration.  Using this ritual on a language you have seen as a piece of writing allows you to read the language for the next 24 hours and, if your Arcana check result is 35 or higher, to write the language in its native script or in any other script you know for the duration.  Using this ritual on a language you have both heard and seen as a piece of writing within the past 24 hours allows you to understand it in both forms for the next 24 hours, and an Arcana check result of 35 or higher allows you to speak and write the language.
Consult Mystic Sages		CLASSES:ALL=10	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:400gp		CASTTIME:30 minutes	RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:10 minutes			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Religion check			DESC:You ask a single question of mysterious, extraplanar presences about matters beyond your ken. Make a Religion check with a +10 bonus instead of an Arcana or a History check to uncover a clue, remember a bit of lore, or otherwise gain information about the world around you.  The ritual grants you a single piece of information. That information can take the form of a word, a name, a phrase, or even a brief story, depending on what exactly you're looking for. You can learn the name of the usurper who ended the Katerran Dynasty a thousand years ago, the burial rites of the Crimson Wolf clan, or the weaknesses of the shadow assassins who have been dogging your steps.  The ritual can't uncover information beyond the ken of the most learned sages. It's of no use if you're trying to find the magic word that unlocks the vampire's crypt, because only the vampire knows the word. Nor can the ritual tell you definitively where great stores of treasure are, but the mystic sages could tell you where a specific empress kept her treasury in ancient times or whether the treasure was looted when her empire fell.
Consult Oracle			CLASSES:ALL=16	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:3600gp	CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:10 minutes			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Religion check			DESC:You coax forth an oracular spirit from the space between the planes. Oracles have no tangible presence and no agendas; they exist only to observe events. This makes them unparalleled sources of information because they have the potential to have seen and heard everything, even information otherwise known to only one creature.  Make a Religion check to determine how many questions you can ask an oracle before it vanishes.  Each question is answered immediately, so you know the answer to one question before asking the next. You must phrase your question so that the oracle can answer it with a single word or a brief phrase. For the oracle to know the answer to a question, the answer must be known to at least one creature, even if that creature is no longer alive.  The oracle has no foreknowledge and only a limited ability to judge what it sees. The oracle can tell you the order in which to activate the glyphs in front of the Gate of the Black Drake, but it can't answer the question "Will we do well if we venture through the gate?"  Ten minutes after you finish performing the ritual, the oracle leaves, even if you have unasked questions remaining.
Cure Disease			CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:150gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One Creature						DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Heal check			DESC:The Cure Disease ritual wipes away a single disease afflicting the subject, whether the disease is active or still incubating. The subject is completely cured and loses any negative side effects and symptoms of the disease.  This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her. Upon completing this ritual, make a Heal check, using the level of the disease as a penalty to this check. The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.  If you know that your subject is suffering from multiple diseases, you must choose which one this ritual will cure.  Otherwise, the ritual affects whichever single disease you knew about. You learn the disease level when you begin the ritual, and at that point you can choose not to continue, without expending any components.
Detect Object			CLASSES:ALL=10	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:400gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Arcana Check	TARGETAREA:One Object						DURATION:5 minutes			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:Name an object. For the duration of the ritual's effect, you can detect the direction and distance to the nearest example of that object, as long as one is within the range defined by your Arcana check result. When attempting to locate a specific object, apply the modifiers from page 303.
Detect Secret Doors		CLASSES:ALL=3	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:25gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Perception		TARGETAREA:Perception						DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:Make an Arcana check. Use the result as a bonus to a Perception check you immediately make to find any secret or hidden doors in your line of sight. If anyone aided you while performing this ritual, they can't help you make the resulting Perception check.
Discern Lies			CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:140gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:5 minutes			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Religion				DESC:Make a Religion check. Use the result as a bonus to your Insight checks to discern any untruths spoken in your presence during the duration. If anyone aided you while performing this ritual, they can't help you make the resulting Insight checks.
Disenchant Magic Item		CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:25gp		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One magic item					DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:When you finish performing this ritual, you touch a magic item and destroy it, turning it into a quantity of residuum valued at one-fifth of the item's price. The item must be your level or lower and must be something that can be created using the Enchant Magic Item ritual.
Drawmij's Instant Summons	CLASSES:ALL=12	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:500gp		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One weapon, implement, or shield		DURATION:Until discharged		SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:Use this ritual to attune one weapon, implement, or shield to yourself. At any time in the future, you can summon that object to your hands as a minor action, at which time the ritual is discharged. Through this ritual, you can have only one weapon, implement, or shield attuned to you at a time.
Enchant Magic Item		CLASSES:ALL=4	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:Special	CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One item						DURATION:Permanent			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:You touch a normal item and turn it into a magic item of your level or lower. The ritual's component cost is equal to the price of the magic item you create.  You can also use this ritual to resize magic armor (for example, shrink a fire giant's magic armor to fit a halfling).  There is no component cost for this use.
Endure Elements			CLASSES:ALL=2	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:20gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:Up to five ritual participants			DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:The Endure Elements ritual lets you designate up to five ritual participants, including yourself, who ignore penalties associated with extremes of nonmagical weather.  An affected creature suffers no ill effects from ambient temperatures between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and the creature's equipment is likewise protected from the ravages of these temperatures and of precipitation.
Eye of Alarm			CLASSES:ALL=2	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:25gp		CASTTIME:30 minutes	RANGE:10			TARGETAREA:One or more squares				DURATION:24 hours (special)		SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:This ritual creates watchful eyes that you place in any square within 10 squares of where you perform the ritual.  Each eye is located in a particular square; it is intangible and can't be interacted with physically. The eyes are nearly invisible and have a Stealth check result of 20 + your level to avoid detection.  Your Arcana check determines how many eyes you can place and what type of vision or sensory ability they possess.  The eyes do not hear, but they see well. Each uses your Perception modifier, with a +5 bonus.  If an eye sees an intruder, it emits a loud warning sound defined by you during the ritual. This sound could be anything from a stentorian "Enemies approach!" to an owl's screech to a fanfare of trumpets. The Perception DC to hear the eye's sound is 0 (modified by distance as normal).  The eyes never consider you an intruder. In addition, you can designate any number of other ritual participants as nonintruders. When you perform the ritual, you can also designate one or more categories of creatures that the eyes will ignore. You can define these categories by obvious physical characteristics (such as height, weight, or body shape), creature type (such as humanoid), creature race (such as hill giant), or obvious equipment (such as a creature carrying a shield with a flame emblazoned upon it).  The ritual's effects last for 24 hours or until you move more than 20 squares from all the eyes.  You can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by using a focus of a small, jeweled eye made of silver and ruby, worth 100 gp.
Eye of Warning			CLASSES:ALL=14	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:800gp		CASTTIME:30 minutes	RANGE:10			TARGETAREA:One or more squares				DURATION:24 hours (special)		SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:This ritual works the same as Eye of Alarm.  In addition, an eye of warning automatically detects any scrying sensor that appears or moves within 10 squares of it, treating the sensor as an intruder. Furthermore, the eye destroys the sensor immediately after warning you unless the creator of the scrying sensor succeeds on an Arcana check (DC 20 + your level). Wherever you are, you instantly know if the eye encounters a sensor. Each round the sensor remains within 10 squares of an eye, the eye attempts to destroy it again.  As with the Eye of Alarm ritual, you can extend the duration of this ritual indefinitely by keeping a focus in the vicinity. This ritual focus is a small, jeweled eye made of gold and ruby, worth 1,600 gp.
Forbiddance				CLASSES:ALL=20	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:5000gp	CASTTIME:30 minutes	RANGE:Arcana Check	TARGETAREA:Burst size depends on Arcana check		DURATION:24 hours (special)		SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:No scrying sensor can enter the area of Forbiddance and no creature can teleport into it, unless the sensor or the creature is higher level than the ritual caster who performed the ritual.  Your Arcana check determines the size of the warded area, which is a burst (see Areas of Effect, page 272).  The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by expending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.
Gentle Repose			CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:10gp		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:Adjacent corpse					DURATION:Special				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:This ritual is performed on an adjacent corpse. It quintuples the time the corpse can lie dead and still be affected by Raise Dead or a similar ritual. Gentle Repose also protects the corpse from being raised as an undead creature for 150 days.
Hallucinatory Creature		CLASSES:ALL=12	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:500gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:One square						DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You create the illusion of a single creature, of any size from Small to Large. It looks and smells like the creature in question.  If the creature can speak or emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM's judgment) -- it's not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation.  You can give the illusion simple instructions, such as having it wander a set area, appear to chew on local plants, and the like. Your Arcana check determines the number of actions you can instruct the illusion to take.  The illusion can perform these actions in a specific sequence, such as moving, taking a standard action, and then moving again, either in an endless loop or starting in response to a specific trigger, such as a door opening.  You can also match each action to a specific trigger. An illusion might move when a creature moves next to it or cower and scream when it is attacked.  Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that it is false.  This check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is a fake.  The illusion cannot travel more than 20 squares from the spot where it first appeared.
Hallucinatory Item		CLASSES:ALL=5	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:25gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:Arcana check determines size			DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You create the illusion of a single inanimate object that appears, to all intents and purposes, to be real. You can use this ritual to create an illusory wall, door, weapon, or other object.  Your Arcana check result determines the illusion's maximum size.  Once you create the illusion, you cannot move it, and it can't include moving parts.  Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that it is false.  This check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is a fake.
Hand of Fate			CLASSES:ALL=4	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:70gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:10 minutes			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:When you perform the ritual, ask up to three questions about possible courses of action. A translucent blue hand appears and indicates with a gesture what the most rewarding course of action is.  The hand can't assess events in the far future; its judgment extends only to likely events in the next hour. If the hand can't indicate a preference, the ritual has no effect and expends no components.
Knock					CLASSES:ALL=4	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:35gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:One object						DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:The Knock ritual allows you to open a single locked door, chest, gate, or other object. It even works against portals sealed with the Arcane Lock ritual or doors secured with bolts or bars that are on the far side, out of reach. You must defeat all the closures on a locked object to unlock it. You make one Arcana check per lock, bar, Arcane Lock, or similar closure. The object you unlock does not open automatically; you still must open it yourself after the ritual unlocks it.  Make an Arcana check with a +5 bonus in place of a Thievery check to open each lock or closure. (See the Thievery skill description, page 189, for example DCs.) To undo bolts or bars you normally couldn't reach, you must succeed on a DC 20 Arcana check.  If you use this ritual successfully against a portal protected by Arcane Lock, you destroy the Arcane Lock and its effects end.
Leomund's Secret Chest		CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:140gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:The focus chest					DURATION:Until dismissed		SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:As part of mastering this ritual, you must create or commission a chest that bears arcane designs, and an object with personal meaning for you must be built into the chest's frame. After the chest is ready, you can store it anywhere you like. Performing this ritual then summons the chest from wherever you left it to wherever you are, along with all its contents. You can remove or add objects to the chest (subject to its natural size limitations) when it is present.  Any time after summoning it, you can dismiss it back to its previous location.  Explorers use this ritual to ensure they have enough supplies or to cart treasure away from a dungeon more easily. If the chest is ever lost or destroyed, you must create a new one before you can perform this ritual again.  Focus: A chest worth at least 200 gp.
Linked Portal			CLASSES:ALL=8	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:135gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:10' radius circle					DURATION:Arcana check			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You create a shortcut across the fabric of the world, linking your location with a permanent teleportation circle somewhere else on the same plane. With a step, you can move from one circle to the other. As part of performing the ritual, you must sketch out a 10-foot-diameter circle in various rare chalks and inks.  This temporary teleportation circle must exactly match the permanent teleportation circle at your destination. It disappears at the end of the portal's duration.  At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check.  The result determines the duration that the portal remains open.  You can use a permanent teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Doing this reduces the cost to 50 gp of reagents and grants you a +5 bonus to your Arcana check.  While the portal is open, any creature that enters the circle at the origin point instantly appears at the other location, along with anything the creature holds or carries.  The creature can even finish the rest of its move. Any number of creatures of any size can use an open portal; the only limitation is the number that can reach the circle before it ends.
Loremaster's Bargain		CLASSES:ALL=22	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:13000gp	CASTTIME:8 hours		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:Special				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Religion check			DESC:Through painstaking research and preparation, you prepare a valuable offering for a powerful extraplanar entity such as an angel, a demigod, a demon, or a devil. Your offering earns you an audience with the being, which appears as a ghostly image that cannot be attacked or physically interacted with. You must succeed on a skill challenge to obtain the information you desire from that entity. You gain a +1 bonus to skill checks made in the skill challenge for every 10 points of your Religion check result (+1 for a result of 10, +2 for a result of 20, +3 for a result of 30, and so on). This challenge might be against Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate, depending on the creature.  Unlike rituals that provide cryptic answers (Consult Oracle) or have limited scope (Consult Mystic Sages), the Loremaster's Bargain ritual provides contact to a creature that might be genuinely informative and helpful, provided you convince it to help. The entity begins in a neutral state-intrigued by the offering and willing to hear you out.  But the entity has agendas of its own, and its nature might color the information and advice it provides.  When you complete the ritual, you can designate up to eight other ritual participants who can also speak with the entity and contribute to the skill challenge. Each one gains the same bonus to skill checks that you do.
Magic Circle			CLASSES:ALL=5	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:100gp		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:A circle						DURATION:Until broken			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You inscribe a circle on the ground, a circle emblazoned with arcane symbols of protection. If drawn correctly, these symbols make it difficult for creatures of a particular origin to enter or pass. When performing the ritual, you choose aberrant, elemental, fey, immortal, natural, shadow, or all. The last option applies a -5 penalty to your check.  The circle requires 1 minute to inscribe per square inside the circle (and it must be a circle).  An affected creature whose level is lower than your Arcana check result minus 10 cannot pass through the circle, affect creatures through the circle's boundary, or affect the boundary in any way. Other creatures of an affected origin take force damage equal to your Arcana check result when passing through the boundary, but doing so breaks the circle. Unaffected creatures can take a standard action to obscure the inscription and break the circle.
Magic Mouth				CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:10gp		CASTTIME:30 minutes	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Surface touched					DURATION:Until discharged		SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:You bind a message into a surface you touch. When conditions you set are met, the surface manifests a mouth and conveys your message, discharging the ritual. The mouth appears to be made out of the same material as the surface, but you otherwise decide the mouth's appearance.
Make Whole				CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:Special	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:Single object					DURATION:Permanent			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:A single object that can fit in a 10-foot cube is completely repaired. The component cost is 20 percent of the item's cost. In cases where you attempt to repair an item not on any price list, the DM determines the cost.
Observe Creature			CLASSES:ALL=24	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:21000gp	CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Current plane	TARGETAREA:One creature						DURATION:Special				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:When you perform this ritual, choose a specific creature.  You create a magical sensor adjacent to that creature, and you can see and hear as if you were standing in the square where your sensor is located. You need not personally know or have ever seen the subject. However, when performing the ritual you must describe your intended subject with sufficient clarity that the ritual unambiguously knows which creature you're talking about. This ritual can show you a creature anywhere in the world, but it can't show you a creature on another plane.  The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended subject in the most straightforward way possible.  If your description is insufficient to determine a specific creature, the ritual fails and no components are expended.  If your statement describes a subject other than the one you intended, the ritual still functions and the components are expended.  You have no inherent way to discern where the sensor is in relation to you, but careful observation might give you some clues. The sensor moves with the subject for the duration of the effect.  Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.  You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.  Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 10,000 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.
Passwall				CLASSES:ALL=12	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:1000gp	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One solid surface					DURATION:1 minute				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You create a passage through any solid material. You choose the orientation of the passage relative to the surface you touch. The passage is 1 square wide and tall. The passage can be a number of squares deep equal to your Arcana check result divided by 5. This ritual does not conceal the passage from anyone or bar anyone from entering.  A creature inside the passage when it closes takes 5d10 damage and is ejected to the nearest end of the passage.  This ritual does not affect the structural integrity of a cavern or a wall; the passage is a twist in space, not an actual shifting of material.
Phantom Steed			CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:70gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Up to eight characters				DURATION:12 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:This ritual conjures forth up to eight horselike creatures.  Each one is Large and can be ridden by you or any other character you designate during the ritual.  Your Arcana check determines the speed of the steeds you conjure and whether they have any special movement capabilities. The steeds have the special movement capabilities associated with your check result and all lower results.  The steeds cannot attack or affect other creatures in any way other than to serve as mounts. Each steed's defense scores are equal to its rider's (or yours, if the steed has no rider). A phantom steed is immune to any effect other than damage.  A steed created by this ritual lasts for 12 hours or until it takes any damage. When the ritual ends, or when a steed is destroyed, the steed fades into nothingness and its rider lands on his or her feet in the steed's space. If a steed is flying when it disappears, the rider descends safely to the ground, landing at the start of his or her next turn.
Planar Portal			CLASSES:ALL=18	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:5000gp	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:10' radius circle					DURATION:Special				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:This ritual works the same as Linked Portal, except that you can use it to travel to other planes. As with Linked Portal, your planar destination must have a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you have memorized.  Your Arcana check determines how long the portal remains open.  When you first learn this ritual, you learn the sigil sequences of two common planar locations, as determined by the DM.
Raise Dead				CLASSES:ALL=8	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:Special	CASTTIME:8 hours		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:A piece of one corpse				DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:To perform the Raise Dead ritual, you must have a part of the corpse of a creature that died no more than 30 days ago. You apply mystic salves, then pray to the gods to restore the dead creature's life. The subject returns to life as if he or she had taken an extended rest. The subject is freed of any temporary conditions suffered at death, but permanent conditions remain.  The subject returns with a death penalty: -1 to all attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks.  This death penalty fades after the subject reaches three milestones.  You can't restore life to a creature that has been petrified or to a creature that died of old age.  The subject's soul must be free and willing to return to life. Some magical effects trap the soul and thus prevent Raise Dead from working, and the gods can intervene to prevent a soul from journeying back to the realm of the living. In all cases, death is less inclined to return paragon and epic heroes; the component cost is 5,000 gp for paragon tier characters and 50,000 gp for epic tier characters.
Remove Affliction			CLASSES:ALL=8	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:250gp		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One creature						DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Heal check			DESC:Remove Affliction wipes away a single enduring effect afflicting the subject. The ritual can remove curses, effects such as charm or domination, and fear, confusion, insanity, polymorph, and petrification effects. All effects of the curse or other effect end.  This ritual is physically taxing to the recipient; if used on an injured character, it can even kill him or her. Upon completing this ritual, make a Heal check, using the level of the effect you are trying to remove (or the level of the creature that caused the effect) as a penalty to this check.  The result indicates the amount of damage the character takes. Assuming the character survives, this damage can be healed normally.  You can use this ritual on an unwilling subject (usually, a former ally who is under some enemy's influence), but you will have to restrain someone unwilling to undergo the ritual. If you know that your subject is suffering from multiple enduring effects, you must choose which one this ritual will remove. Otherwise, it affects whichever one affliction you knew about. You learn the affliction level when you begin the ritual, and you can choose not to continue, without expending any components (for example, if you determine the affliction is too powerful for you to remove).
Secret Page				CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:10gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Touch			TARGETAREA:One page						DURATION:Permanent			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You ward writings so others cannot read them. Use of this ritual protects one page (maximum 250 words). You make the page appear not to exist, causing anyone other than you to ignore it; the page's presence is blocked from a reader's mind. You can choose instead to obscure the page with false writings, which you produce before performing the ritual. Other readers see the false text rather than the real text.  When you perform the ritual, make an Arcana check, with a +5 bonus. The result is the DC for a Perception check to notice the concealed writing (readers use passive Perception unless they are specifically looking for concealed text).
Sending				CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:50gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:Arcana check	TARGETAREA:One person you know				DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You convey a mental message of up to 25 words to a person you know. If the target is within range, he or she receives the message mentally and can respond likewise.  The ritual's maximum range is determined by your Arcana check result.
Shadow Walk				CLASSES:ALL=12	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:500gp		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Special		TARGETAREA:You and your allies				DURATION:8 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:You and your allies walk through shadows stretching out of the Shadowfell, taking advantage of the strange disparities between distance in your realm and that one to travel quickly. Multiply your overland travel speed by 5 for the duration. This ritual functions only in the natural world.
Silence				CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:30gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:Single room or burst 4 area			DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:You ward a single room (or a burst 4 area), against eavesdropping.  Creatures attempting to listen to something in the warded area from outside the area take a -10 penalty to their Perception checks.
Speak with Dead			CLASSES:ALL=6	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:140gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:One corpse of an intelligent creature	DURATION:10 minutes			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Religion check			DESC:You ask the corpse of an intelligent creature questions and receive answers. The corpse knows what the creature knew in life, what has occurred near the corpse, and no more; the spirit has (usually) moved on to another plane and is not present in the body.  Your Religion check result determines the number of questions you can ask.  At the DM's option, questioning the departed spirit might require a skill challenge using Diplomacy.
Tenser's Floating Disk		CLASSES:ALL=1	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:10gp		CASTTIME:24 hourse	RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that floats a foot off the ground and can carry what you lay upon it. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It remains stationary unless you move more than 5 squares away from it, in which case it moves with your base speed once per round until it is within 5 squares of you. You can command the disk to move up to your speed as a move action. If you are more than 5 squares from the disk for 2 consecutive rounds, the disk disappears, dropping whatever it was carrying.  Your Arcana check result determines the maximum load the disk can carry.
Traveler's Feast			CLASSES:ALL=4	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:35gp		CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:24 hours				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:You create food and water, enough to feed five Medium or Small creatures or two Large creatures for 24 hours. You designate the type of eaters when performing the ritual, and the ritual creates appropriate food (trail rations for people, grain for horses, and so on).  Any food or water created but uneaten disappears at the end of the duration.
True Portal				CLASSES:ALL=28	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:50000gp	CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:10' radius circle					DURATION:Arcana check			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:This ritual works the same as Linked Portal (page 307), except as noted here.  You are not limited to teleporting to places you've seen or that have permanent teleportation circles. However, when performing the ritual, you must describe your intended destination clearly. "Lord Ambrose's audience chamber" is sufficient, as is "the nearest temple of Pelor."  Your description must use only place names and other static references; you can't say "wherever Princess Katria is" or "the nearest pile of gold."  The magic of the ritual interprets your intended destination in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific destination, the ritual fails, but no components are expended. If your description causes the portal to lead somewhere you did not intend -- for example, if the nearest temple of Pelor is not in the city you'd hoped it would be -- the ritual still functions, and the ritual's components are expended.  If the destination is blocked by a warding ritual, such as Forbiddance, the ritual opens the destination portal at a point along the ward's boundary. You can see through the portal before you enter, and you don't have to step through if you don't want to.  You can use a teleportation circle as the origin point of this ritual, making minor temporary modifications as part of the ritual. Using a teleportation circle reduces the ritual's component cost to 1,000 gp and grants a +5 bonus to your Arcana check.
View Location			CLASSES:ALL=14	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:1600gp	CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Current plane	TARGETAREA:One location that you have been to		DURATION:Arcana check			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:When you perform this ritual, choose a location you have previously visited. The location must be fixed in place (for example, you can't use this to scry into the cabin of an oceangoing vessel), and it must still be at the same place (and in more or less the same shape) as when you visited.  Redecorating a room won't fool View Location scrying, but destroying a tower and rebuilding it with a different layout would cause the ritual to fail (until you visit the new location).  You know if the ritual has failed before you expend any components. This ritual can show you a location anywhere in the world, but it can't show you a location on another plane.  This ritual creates a scrying sensor -- a shimmer in the air -- that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC of %1 to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.  You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.  Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.  Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 1,000 gp.  The focus conveys what you see and hear.|10+TL
View Object				CLASSES:ALL=18	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:7000gp	CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Current plane	TARGETAREA:One object that you have held or seen	DURATION:Arcana check			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:When you perform this ritual, choose a specific object of up to Large size. You need not have held or viewed the object. However, when performing the ritual you must describe the object with sufficient clarity that the ritual unambiguously knows which object you're talking about.  "Duke Karlerren's ancestral broadsword" is sufficient, as is "the nearest gold coin," but "the most powerful magic item nearby" is not. This ritual can show you an object anywhere in the world, but it can't show you an object on another plane.  The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended object in the most straightforward way possible.  If your description is insufficient to determine a specific object, the ritual fails, and no components are expended.  If your statement describes an object other than the one you intended -- for example, if the nearest gold coin is in your pocket, rather than in the hidden treasure vault you're looking for -- the ritual still functions, and the components are expended.  You have no inherent way to discern where the object is in relation to you, but careful observation can give you some clues. If you see the duke's sword hanging on a stone wall, for example, you don't necessarily know whether that wall is across town or across the world.  This ritual creates a scrying sensor -- a shimmer in the air -- adjacent to the viewed object that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC of %1 to notice the sensor.  They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.  You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.  Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts. The sensor moves with the object for this duration.|10+TL
Voice of Fate			CLASSES:ALL=26	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:45000gp	CASTTIME:1 hour		RANGE:Personal		TARGETAREA:Self							DURATION:Instantaneous			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Religion check			DESC:You consult an entity of fate -- perhaps a servant of Avandra, Ioun, Pelor, or the Raven Queen -- for a glimpse into what the future holds. You ask questions, and a rumbling voice replies.  Your Religion check determines the number of questions you can ask.  Your questions must relate to a specific goal, event, or activity that has yet to occur. Since what is yet to occur is not known by any mortal being, the answers need not be known by any creature, alive or dead. This ritual can answer only questions related to events occurring within the next 7 days. After that, the skein of possibilities is too indistinct to gain useful information.  The guidance from the entity of fate is accurate, but great heroes are capable of thwarting fate, at least for a time. If the ritual reveals that a course of action is "certain doom," you should realize that nothing is truly certain until it happens. In addition, the entity of fate assumes that you will act on its guidance completely and immediately. If you don't act on the information, or if you change the conditions in existence when you performed the ritual, then the guidance might no longer be useful.
Water Breathing			CLASSES:ALL=8	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:135gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:Up to eight participants				DURATION:Arcana or Nature check	SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana or Nature check	DESC:When you perform this ritual, you can designate up to eight participants (including yourself if you wish) who breathe water as easily as they breathe air. Furthermore, they can speak normally underwater.  Water Breathing doesn't change your ability to breathe air. It doesn't confer a greater swim speed or the ability to fight underwater unhindered. It does protect any gear you and the participants carry, such as books and scrolls, from water damage.  Your check result determines the duration of the effect.
Water Walk				CLASSES:ALL=2	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:20gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:0			TARGETAREA:You or an ally					DURATION:1 hour				SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:No check				DESC:You or an ally can move on water as if it were solid ground.  Rapids or choppy seas are considered difficult terrain. The target of this ritual can end its benefits as a free action. The target can immerse itself in water or swim underwater if desired without needing to end the ritual.
Wizard's Sight			CLASSES:ALL=8	TYPE:Ritual	COMPS:270gp		CASTTIME:10 minutes	RANGE:20			TARGETAREA:One square						DURATION:Arcana check			SAVEINFO:None	SPELLRES:Arcana check			DESC:When you perform a Wizard's Sight ritual, choose a square within 20 squares of you, even a square that you can't see or don't have line of effect to. You create a magical sensor in that square. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.  Your Arcana check determines how long the sensor lasts.  The ritual creates a scrying sensor -- a shimmer in the air -- that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC of %1 to notice the sensor. They can't disrupt or interact with the sensor in any way.  Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block Wizard's Sight. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.  Focus: A mirror or a crystal ball worth at least 200 gp.  The focus conveys what you see and hear.|10+TL
