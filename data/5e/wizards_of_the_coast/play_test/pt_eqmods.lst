# Modifier Name	Unique Key		Type								Type granted		Prohibited Type			Special Property
Ammunition		KEY:AMMUNITION									ITYPE:Ammunition							SPROP:You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to launch from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute searching the battlefield. If you employ such a weapon to make a melee attack, you use the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
# Can't use ITYPE:Double - throws an error!
Double		KEY:DOUBLE																			SPROP:A double weapon has a blade or a bludgeon on both ends. You are considered to have a different light weapon in each hand when you wield the weapon with both hands. A double weapon has two damage values. The first one is for the weapon's primary end, and the second is for the secondary end, which is used only when you're attack with both ends.
Finesse		KEY:FINESSE										ITYPE:Finesse							SPROP:When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you can use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier with your attack and damage rolls.

Thrown		KEY:THROWN										ITYPE:Thrown							SPROP:If the weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon at a target to make a ranged attack.

Two-Handed		KEY:TWOHANDED									ITYPE:TwoHanded							SPROP:This weapon requires two hands to use.
Versatile		KEY:VERSATILE									ITYPE:Versatile							SPROP:This weapon can be used with one or two hands. It has two damage values. The first is for its one-handed use, the second for when using it two-handed. Small creatures can use these weapons only two-handed.
