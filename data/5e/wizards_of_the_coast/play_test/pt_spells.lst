# Spell Name			School			Casting Time																Range										Duration						Description
Aid					SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:8 hours					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:The aid spell invests its recipients with tough-ness and resolve.	DESC:Choose up to three creatures within range that are not currently affected by this spell. Each target's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.
Air Walk				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:5 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:4th-Level	DESC:You impart the power of the wind upon a crea-ture, allowing it to walk upon the air with the same ease that it moves across the ground.	DESC:Choose a willing creature within range. Until the spell ends, the target can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. The target can move upward or downward at a 45 degree angle at half its speed. Treat winds stronger than twenty miles per hour as difficult terrain. If the spell ends while the target is airborne, it falls if this spell is the only thing keeping it aloft. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can add one target for each level above 4th.
Alarm					SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 minute																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:8 hours					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:(ritual) You create magical wards to alert you when creatures approach.	DESC:Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm sounds whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. Also, choose the type of alarm, mental or audible. A mental alarm alerts you with a psychic ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you from sleep. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds. Anyone within 50 feet of the warded area can hear the bell. Reduce the dis-tance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each interposing wall. Material Components: A tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire.
Animal Friendship			SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:24 hours					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:Your magic grants you the ability to befriend beasts and other natural animals. In your pres-ence, they become calm and docile, and may even do your bidding.	DESC:Choose a beast within range that can see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the spell ends. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spells ends early. Material Components: A morsel of food the animal likes.
Animal Messenger			SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:8 hours					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:(ritual) You cup your hands and call to an animal you can see. That creature delivers your message to a person who matches a general description, such as a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard.	DESC:Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You command it to go to a location you have visited and deliver a message of up to 25 words to a creature that you describe. The messenger speaks only to that creature. If the messenger does not reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost. Material Components: A morsel of food the animal likes.
Animate Dead			SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 minute																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:24 hours					DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:You utter an incantation that bestows undeath upon a pile of bones or a corpse. As your droning voice invokes this dark magic, bones twitch or muscles contract, and a skeleton or zombie lurches to its feet, awaiting your command. Animating the dead is not a good act. Those who dabble in such magic must have a just rea-son to do so lest they offend the forces of good and law.	DESC:Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics). The creature is under your control for the duration or until it is de-stroyed. As part of your action, you can command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 50 feet of you. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you create one additional undead creature for each level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a dif-ferent corpse or pile of bones. Material Components: A drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust.
Antimagic Field			SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:8th-Level	DESC:Inside the transparent cloud of an antimagic field spell, you divorce your immediate surroundings from magic. Spells fizzle out, summoned crea-tures disappear, and even magic items become mundane when they come in contact with the suppressing field. Although you are safe from hostile magic used against you, the magic on which you depend is also beyond your reach while the field holds.	DESC:A 10-foot-radius invisible cloud of antimagic surrounds you. Until the spell ends, the cloud moves with you, centered on you. Magical effects, except those created by an ar-tifact or a deity, are suppressed in the cloud and cannot protrude into it. While an effect is sup-pressed, it does not function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted Effects: Spells and other magical ef-fects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the cloud have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic: The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, cannot extend into the cloud, and if the cloud overlaps an area of magic, the part of that area that is covered by the cloud is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the cloud, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Magic on Creatures and Objects: Any active magical effect on a creature or an object in the cloud is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items: The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the cloud. For ex-ample, a +1 long sword in the cloud functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the cloud or wielded by an attacker in the cloud. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the cloud (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the cloud), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel: Teleportation fails to work in the cloud, whether the cloud is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another world or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space, such as that created by a rope trick spell, tempo-rarily closes while in the cloud.  Summoned Creatures: A creature summoned by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the cloud. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupies is no longer within the cloud. Dispel Magic: Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic and greater dispel magic have no effect on the cloud. Likewise, the clouds created by different antimagic fields do not nullify each other. Material Components: A pinch of powdered iron or iron filings.
Arcane Eye				SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:4th-Level	DESC:You touch a spot on your forehead, and a shim-mering eye appears there for a moment. The eye then invisibly scouts for you.	DESC:You create an invisible, hovering sensor within range that lasts for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the sensor, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 10 feet. The sensor can look in every direction. As an action, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it cannot enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the sensor's movement, but the sensor can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter. Material Components: A bit of bat fur.
Arcane Gate				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:500 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:6th-Level	DESC:At your command, two glowing portals appear and hover inches over the ground. As long as the portals remain open, any creature entering one can exit the other.	DESC:Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A 10-foot-diameter portal opens over each point, centered on the point and perpendicular to it. The portals remain open for the duration. Any creature or object entering one portal ex-its from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other. Mist fills each portal, pre-venting vision through it.
Arcane Lock				SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Permanent				DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:(ritual) You bind a door so that intruders can not easily pass. The door becomes impassible to anyone other than you and those you allow to pass.	DESC:Touch a door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway that is closed. The chosen object is magically locked. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or sup-pressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes. While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break; the DC to break it increases by 10.
Astral Projection			SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 hour																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:Permanent				DESC:9th-Level	DESC:You loosen the body's hold on the soul to enter the infinite expanse of the Astral Plane. The body you leave behind rests inert in a state of sus-pended animation. Requirement: For each creature you will af-fect with this spell, you must provide a jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, which are all consumed by the spell.	DESC:You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane. The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended ani-mation; it does not need food or air and does not age. Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game sta-tistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends out from the base of your spine and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane, your astral form disappears, and you gain a body capable of surviving on the plane you vis-it. Your game statistics do not change, and the new body is acclimated to its plane. If you return to the Astral Plane, the body created for the plane you visited disappears, and your astral body reappears. The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to end it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. The spell might also end prematurely for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic or greater dispel magic used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. And if a creature's astral body is re-duced to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points or fewer.
Augury				SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 minute																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:(ritual) By casting gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or using some other divining tool, you consult with spirits to learn whether an effort in the immedi-ate future will be beneficial or harmful to you and your companions.	DESC:Describe a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. You re-ceive an answer from an otherworldly entity about the results of that course of action. The DM chooses from the following possible answers: . Weal, for good results . Woe, for bad results . Weal and woe, for both good and bad results . Nothing, for results that are not especially good or bad The spell does not take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a 25 per-cent chance on each casting after the first that you get a false reading. The DM makes this roll in secret. Material Components: Specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp, which are not consumed by the spell.
Awaken				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:8 hours																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:5th-Level	DESC:You spend a day to magically trace in a gemstone the mental pathways that give an intelligent creature its ability to reason. You then touch the gemstone to an animal or a plant, awakening it to humanlike sentience. Requirement: You must provide an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which is consumed by the spell.	DESC:Touch a Large or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 2 or less. The target perma-nently gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant. The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.
Banishment				SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:6th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You single out an otherworldly creature and try to compel it to return to its own plane. If it fails to resist your will, it disappears with a faint pop.	DESC:Choose one celestial, elemental, or fiend within range that is not on its plane of origin. That creature must make a Charisma sav-ing throw. On a failed save, the creature instantly returns to its plane of origin. If the creature suc-ceeds on the saving throw, it has disadvantage on any attacks it makes against you before the end of its next turn. You can increase the creature's saving throw DC by presenting items the creature hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such item you present, the DM might increase the DC by 1 or more. Material Components: Any item that is dis-tasteful to the target.
Barkskin				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:Your touch transforms a creature's skin into a thick, bark-like material that is as tough as wood.	DESC:A willing creature that you touch gains a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.
Beacon of Hope			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:Your prayer energizes you and those you desig-nate with hope, life, and the will to push through even the most trying circumstances.	DESC:Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has ad-vantage on Wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and a target regains the maxi-mum number of hit points possible from any healing.
Blade Barrier			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:6th-Level	DESC:When you cast blade barrier, a terrific noise aris-es as a wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical force comes into being. The blades scrape and squeal as they dance around the point you designate.	DESC:You create a vertical wall of whirling blades within range that lasts for the duration. You can choose to make the wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cov-er to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain. The wall deals 6d10 slashing damage to each creature within its area. It deals this damage when it appears, when a creature passes through the wall (but no more than once per turn), and whenever a creature ends its turn inside the wall. When a creature would take damage from the wall, it can make a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage instead. If you create the wall on top of a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it passed through the wall. On a success, the creature can move 5 feet so it is not in the wall.
Bless					SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:1st-Level	DESC:You bestow a blessing on your companions, giv-ing them the heart to face their present trial.	DESC:Choose any number of creatures within range that are not already affected by this spell. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a sav-ing throw before the spell ends, it can add a d4 to the result.
Blight				SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:4th-Level	DESC:When tending a garden, removing growth that has become too wild is just as important as en-couraging new life. Though this spell is most suited to eradicating a single plant, you can also use it to harm any living creature.	DESC:Choose a living creature within range that you can see. The creature must make a Con-stitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a nonmagical plant that is not a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it does not make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you deal 1d8 extra necrotic damage for each level above 4th.
Blink					SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self, but only if you are not on the Ethereal Plane	DURATION:1 minute					DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:This spell was developed in an attempt to repli-cate the ability of blink dogs to briefly vanish into the Ethereal Plane.	DESC:Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns before the spell ends. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane. At the start of your next turn, you return in a space of your choice within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. Unless you have magic that can reach across planes, you can affect and be affected only by creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane while you are there. If you roll a 1 on the d20, roll again. If you roll another 1, you are lost in the Ethereal Plane for 2d6 hours. At the end of that time, you reappear as described above.
Blur					SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:You body becomes blurred, shifting and waver-ing to all who can see you. Your unstable appearance makes it difficult for your enemies to strike you.	DESC:For the duration, any creature has dis-advantage on attack rolls against you, unless the creature has blindsight or a similar capability.
Burning Hands			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:1st-Level	DESC:As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips.	DESC:Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 1st.
Call Lightning			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:You create a miniature lightning storm. At your command, lightning arcs from the storm to blast your enemies.	DESC:Choose a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down another lightning strike. If a targeted creature is outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the damage increases to 6d10 against that creature. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage in-creases by 1d10 for each level above 3rd.
Cause Fear				SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:Your eyes glow with pale green light, and your visage seems to undergo a horrifying alteration, becoming a supernatural image of dread made manifest.	DESC:Each living creature of your choice within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for the duration. On its turn, a creature affected by this spell can use its action to make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC. If the creature succeeds on the check, it is no longer affected by the spell.
Chain Lightning			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:6th-Level	DESC:Arcs of lightning flash from your blazing eyes as you cast this spell. When you release its magic, a bolt of lightning leaps from you to strike a crea-ture, and then splits into three bolts that arc toward others.	DESC:You create a bolt of lightning that strikes a target you choose within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three secondary targets, each of which must be within 25 feet of the primary target. Divide the three bolts among the potential secondary tar-gets as you wish. A secondary target can be a creature or an object, and one target can be struck by as many as two of the bolts. For each bolt that strikes a target, that target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. Material Components: A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; plus three silver pins.
Charm Person			SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:1 hour					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:This spell twists a person's mind so that the per-son sees you in the best possible light in the present circumstances. A foe might perceive you as nonthreatening, while a bored shopkeeper might suddenly regard you with unfounded trust.	DESC:Choose a living humanoid within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
Chill Touch				SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:1 round					DESC:cantrip Your hand glows with blue energy that disrupts the life force of living creatures.	DESC:Make an attack roll to touch a living creature. You have a bonus to the roll equal to your magic ability modifier + your spellcasting bonus, if any. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 ne-crotic damage, and it cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn. At Higher Levels: The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach a caster level of 5th (2d8), 10th (3d8), 15th (4d8), and 20th (5d8).
Circle of Death			SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:6th-Level	DESC:When you cast this spell, you trace a circle with your finger in the air. The circle forges a link to the Negative Energy Plane around the enemies you indicate, snuffing out their life force and kill-ing them instantly.	DESC:Choose a point within range that you can see. Each living creature within 50 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Material Components: The powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp.
Clone					SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 hour																RANGE:5 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:8th-Level	DESC:The best safeguard against the unthinkable is a copy of your physical body, ready to take your place if you are disintegrated by a trap, de-stroyed by a demon prince, or ground to powder beneath the heel of a titan. Casting the clone spell is best done someplace out of the way, where the duplicate can mature for several months without being disturbed. Requirement: You must provide a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp (consumed by the spell); a crystal vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a Medi-um creature; and a quantity of seawater sufficient to fill the container.	DESC:Choose the remains of a Medium crea-ture within range (at least a cubic inch of flesh). An inert duplicate of the target, known as a clone, forms inside the sealed crystal vessel and ma-tures after 120 days. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavaila-ble, but in such a case the resulting body is soulless, inert flesh. An inert clone endures in-definitely, as long as its crystal jar remains undisturbed. At any time after the clone matures, if the orig-inal creature dies, the creature's soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and will-ing to return. The clone is physically identical with the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the origi-nal's equipment. If the original's body is restored to life after a clone is activated, the clone remains a separate individual. The clone starts with the memories and abilities of the original creature, but its per-sonality quickly diverges. There is a 75 percent chance that the clone is antagonistic toward the original; its most pressing goal becomes to de-stroy the original, so as to take the original's place and perhaps corrupt or undo anything the original accomplished.
Cloudkill				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:5th-Level	DESC:As you cast this spell, noisome, yellow-green va-pors roll across the ground, bringing death to creatures caught within them.	DESC:Choose a point within range. You create a 20-foot-radius cloud of poisonous fog centered there. It lasts for the duration, and its area is heavily obscured. When the cloud appears, each living creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 poison damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also must make this saving throw if it ends its turn inside the cloud or if it passes through the cloud (but no more than once per turn). The cloud moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the sur-face of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage in-creases by 1d8 for each level above 5th.
Color Spray				SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:1 round					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:This spell creates a dazzling array of flashing colors that dazes and disorients onlookers. A creature exposed to its effects feels a sense of vertigo and a clash of emotions, as the illusion overwhelms its senses and confuses its mind.	DESC:Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided the crea- ture can see. For every creature that fails its sav-ing throw, roll a d6 to determine the spell's effect on that creature. 1-2: Until the end of the creature's next turn, the creature's speed is halved, and it has disad-vantage on attack rolls and ability checks. 3-4: The only action the creature can take on its next turn is an attack against a randomly de-termined target within range. 5-6: Until the end of the creature's next turn, the creature is frightened by you and must move as far away from you as possible before taking any action. Material Components: A pinch each of pow-der or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue.
Command				SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:1 round					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:You channel supernatural authority to compel a creature into obedience.	DESC:You speak a one-word command to a living creature within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn, unless the creature doesn't un-derstand it. Some typical commands and their effects fol-low. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target is prevented from following the command issued to it, the spell ends. Approach: The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn. Flee: The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. Grovel: The target falls prone and then ends its turn. Halt: The target does not move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided it is able to do so.
Commune				SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:1 minute					DESC:5th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You beseech a deity or a servant thereof for knowledge to aid you in making a decision.	DESC:You contact your deity, or a divine proxy, and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or a no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. Divine beings of the Outer Planes are not nec-essarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as answer instead. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a 25 per-cent chance on each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret. Material Components: Incense and a vial of holy or unholy water.
Comprehend Languages		SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:1 hour					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:(ritual) The world is home to countless languages and dialects, tongues whose meaning is lost on even the most erudite scholars. This spell makes the incomprehensible comprehensible.	DESC:For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of spoken language that you hear and of written language that you can see, provid-ed you are touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. This spell does not reveal secret messages that are concealed in a text, and it does not allow you to read magical writing or inscriptions, such as those deciphered by the read magic spell. Material Components: A pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.
Cone of Cold			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:5th-Level	DESC:Frost stings your fingertips as you open an ephemeral link to an Inner Plane where ice reigns supreme.

DESC:You mentally contact a mysterious enti-ty from another plane, and you ask it up to five questions that can be answered with a single word. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the an-swer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer. When you receive the answer to each question, make an Intelligence or a Charisma check (your choice). The DC for the first question is 5, and the DC increases by 5 for each subsequent question. If you fail the check, you take 6d6 psychic dam-age, the spell ends, and you can't cast spells until you complete a long rest.

A creature also must make this saving throw if it ends its turn in the swarm or if it moves through it, but not more than once per turn. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can move the swarm up to 20 feet.
Cure Wounds				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:1st-Level	DESC:You channel positive energy into an injured crea-ture to mend its wounds.

DESC:You touch an object you are holding or one that is not being worn or carried. A 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the object is filled with darkness for the duration. Not even a crea-ture with darkvision can see through this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. Covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

Death Ward				SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:8 hours					DESC:4th-Level	DESC:You call upon the power of the gods to weave a shield of fate around a creature.

Destruction				SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:7th-Level	DESC:Your voice booms like thunder as you intone this potent spell. Each syllable causes the target crea-ture's body to shudder and twist as its essential nature unravels.

Within the same radi-us, you detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated by mag-ic.

Detect Magic			SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:1st-Level	DESC:(ritual) Upon casting detect magic, you sense any magic in the area. Studying the auras can give you clues to the nature of the magic.	DESC:For the duration, you sense the pres-ence of magic within 25 feet of you. If you sense magic, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
Detect Poison and Disease	SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:1st-Level	DESC:(ritual) You cast a spell that allows you to perceive the least hint of poison, venom, disease, and similar toxins and contagions, such as those that are se-creted by a beast or applied to an assassin's blade.

One door appears next to you, the other up to hundreds of feet away. When you step into the nearer door, you instantly emerge from the farther one, and they both disappear.	DESC:You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "up-ward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet." You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller carrying gear up to its maximum load. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell. If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell is lost but fails to teleport you.
Disguise Self			SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:1 hour					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:Weaving strands of illusion magic, you fashion a new appearance for yourself.	DESC:You make yourself-including your clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment-look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into something while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on a Wisdom check against your spellcasting DC.
Disintegrate			SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:6th-Level	DESC:As you cast this spell, a thin green ray springs from your pointing finger. Where it strikes, matter turns to dust.	DESC:Choose a target within range that you can see. The target can be a creature, an object other than a magic item, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force. A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the ray strikes the target. If the target has 60 hit points or fewer, it is disintegrated. Otherwise, it takes 17d6 force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points or fewer, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and all its possessions are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. It can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrec- tion or a wish spell. A Large or smaller object targeted by this spell is automatically disintegrated. If the target is a Huge or larger object, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. Material Components: A lodestone and a pinch of dust.
Dispel Magic			SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:This spell can unravel and suppress magical ef-fects from a variety of sources.

The spell does not take into account any possi-ble circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. This spell contacts otherworldly entities for answers. The first time you cast it, you can re-ceive a reliable answer based on your query. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a 25 per-cent chance on each casting after the first that you get a false reading. The DM makes this roll in secret. Material Components: Incense and a sacrifi-cial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp.
Divine Favor			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:Swift																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:1st-Level	DESC:Your deity answers your prayer and empowers your weapon strikes with divine radiance.

DESC:Choose a beast within range that you can see. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or your companions are fighting it, it has ad-vantage on the saving throw. The charmed target can't take reactions, and you have a telepathic link with it while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. Through the link, you choose the target's ac-tions and where it moves by commanding it telepathically. Doing so requires no action on your part, but you must be able to take actions. If you give the target no commands, it does nothing other than what it needs to survive, such as mov-ing away from a threat. The target can communicate simple concepts to you through the telepathic link, and you can use your action to gain an awareness of the tar-get's surroundings until the start of your next turn, as interpreted by the target's senses. The target makes a new saving throw against the spell if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
Dominate Monster			SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:1 hour					DESC:8th-Level	DESC:You focus your mind on a nearby creature and attempt to bend it to your will.	DESC:Choose a living creature within range that you can see. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the dura-tion. You have a telepathic link with the charmed target while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. Through the link, you choose the target's ac-tions and where it moves by commanding it telepathically. Doing so requires no action on your part, but you must be able to take actions. You can also command the target to take a reac-tion, which requires the use of your reaction. If you give the target no commands, it does nothing other than what it needs to survive, such as mov-ing away from a threat. The target can use the telepathic link to com-municate simple concepts to you. You can use your action to gain an awareness of the target's surroundings until the start of your next turn, as interpreted by the target's senses. The target makes a new saving throw against the spell if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
Dominate Person			SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:1 hour					DESC:5th-Level	DESC:The words of dominate person connect your mind to the mind of another person. Through that connection, the person becomes your thrall.	DESC:Choose a living humanoid within range that you can see. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the dura-tion. If you or your companions are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. The charmed target can't take reactions, and you have a telepathic link with it while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. Through the link, you choose the target's ac-tions and where it moves by commanding it telepathically. Doing so requires no action on your part, but you must be able to take actions. If you give the target no commands, it does nothing other than what it needs to survive, such as mov-ing away from a threat. The target can communicate simple concepts to you through the telepathic link, and you can use your action to gain an awareness of the tar-get's surroundings until the start of your next turn, as interpreted by the target's senses. The spell fails if you give the target an order that is obviously self-destructive. The target makes a new saving throw against the spell if you give it an order that is counter to its align-ment or if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.
Druidcraft				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous or 1 minute		DESC:cantrip Wind whispering through the trees, the laughter of a creek, and the rumble of an approaching storm are manifestations of nature's voice. You understand that voice, and you can learn secrets from and influence minor aspects of nature with this cantrip.	DESC:You create one of the following effects within range. . You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that lasts for up to 1 minute and predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. You might create a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. . You produce up to five wisps of light that last for up to 1 minute. As part of the action you used to cast this cantrip, or as a separate ac-tion, you can direct the wisps to dance, move to any point within 25 feet of you that you can see, or trace a pattern in the air. The wisps can move as a group or independently. . You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom. . You instantly make a leaf, a pebble, a twig, or another natural object tumble or blow up to 25 feet in a cardinal direction you name, even if you do not know the direction. . You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal crashing through brush, or the faint odor of skunk. .

Earthquake				SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:500 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:8th-Level	DESC:As you complete the incantation, the rock under-foot buckles and shakes, creatures tumble into fissures, and structures collapse.	DESC:Choose a point on the ground within range that you can see. For the duration, an in-tense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area. The ground in the area becomes difficult ter-rain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating on a spell must make a Constitu-tion saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken. When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each crea-ture on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls prone, and if it has 50 hit points or fewer, it cannot take actions until it leaves the area or the spell ends. This spell has additional effects depending on the terrain in the area. Ceiling: If the spell's area touches or includes a vertical surface (such as a wall or a column) that connects to a ceiling, debris falls from the ceiling in the area. At the start of each of your turns af-ter you cast the spell and before it ends, each creature under the ceiling, including flying crea-tures, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone. If the creature is already prone, it is buried in rubble (see below). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and does not fall prone. Cliff: If the spell's area touches or includes a vertical surface, such as a cliff, that does not have a ceiling, the vertical surface crumbles away and becomes a landslide. The landslide pushes out from the affected surface horizontally as far as it falls vertically. For example, if the affected area is 100 feet tall, the landslide spreads out 100 feet from the cliff's base in any direction where its path is unobstructed. The landslide begins at the start of your turn after you cast the spell. Each creature in the landslide's path must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone. If the creature is already prone, it is buried in rubble (see below). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and does not fall prone, and the landslide moves the crea-ture along with it in a straight line away from the vertical surface to a space on the slide's leading edge. Open Ground: Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. Each Medium or smaller crea-ture on the ground in the spell's area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls 1d10 I? 10 feet into a fissure, tak-ing falling damage as normal. The DC to climb out is the same as the spell save DC. The fissures close when the spell ends, killing any creatures still inside them. Any pools of liquid in the area drain into the fissures. Structures: The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points or fewer, it collapses. Each creature inside a collapsed struc-ture made of wood, stone, or a similar hard material must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, falls prone, and becomes buried in rub-ble. On a successful save, it takes half damage and does not fall prone or become buried. Buried in Rubble: A creature buried in rubble cannot move and might not be able to see or hear beyond the rubble. For each full minute the creature spends buried, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. A buried creature can use its action to make a Strength check to try to dig out of the rubble. The DM sets the DC based on the materi-al: DC 15 is appropriate for a typical mixture of earth and stone. On a successful check, the crea-ture digs itself free. Another creature can use an action to dig out a creature buried in rubble, provided the rescuing creature knows the buried creature's approxi-mate location.

Additionally, when you take bludgeoning, pierc-ing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage. Fire: You are immune to fire damage. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with a melee attack, that creature takes 1d6 fire damage. In addition, your melee attacks deal 1d6 extra fire damage. Water: You have a swim speed equal to your land speed, and you can breathe underwater. You also have fire resistance. Finally, whenever you take fire or lightning damage, choose a point within 20 feet of you.

On a success, the creature frees itself.

Squirming, ebony tenta-cles appear within a 20-foot radius centered on that point and turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain for the duration. Any unrestrained creature that enters the af-fected area or starts its turn there must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludg-eoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength check against the spell's DC. On a success, the creature frees itself.

Mage Hand				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:cantrip The spectral hand you create with this spell can manipulate objects, open doors, and carry small items for you.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it (no action required) or cast this spell again. The hand van-ishes if it is ever more than 25 feet away from you.

You can use the hand to ma-nipulate an object, open a door or a container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 25 feet each time you use it. The hand cannot attack, use magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
Magic Missile			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:1st-Level	DESC:A spell famous for its reliability, magic missile produces darts of magical force that unerringly strike their targets. Some spellcasters alter the appearance of this spell when they cast it. A necromancer's magical dart might look like a skeletal hand, while an evoker's might resemble a spectral lance.	DESC:You create three darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice within range that you can see. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target.

DESC:Choose a point within range. Each liv-ing creature you choose within 25 feet of that point that you can see must succeed on a Wis-dom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, a creature af-fected by this spell makes another saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on that creature. Material Components: A small, straight piece of iron.
Mass Invisibility			SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:7th-Level	DESC:You weave a potent illusion to make several creatures you choose disappear from view. The illusion is fragile, however. If even one affected creature takes a hostile action, the spell's power fails. Also, if any member of the group strays too far from the others, that creature is no longer invisible.	DESC:Choose one creature within range. That creature and any willing creatures you choose within 20 feet of it become invisible. The crea-tures remain invisible for the duration. If any creature affected by this spell attacks or casts a spell that affects a creature other than itself, the effect ends for all creatures affected by the spell. Furthermore, the spell ends for an af-fected creature that starts its turn more than 30 feet from any other creature affected by this spell. Material Components: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.
Mass Suggestion			SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:6th-Level	DESC:The magic suffusing your words makes your suggestion sound like the most reasonable thing in the world. You can use this spell to convince suspicious guards to let you pass without ques-tion, cause enemies to believe they are choking, or otherwise influence creatures.	DESC:Choose up to six creatures within range that can hear and understand you. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes charmed by you for the dura-tion or until you harm it. You can use your action to suggest a course of action to one charmed target within range. That target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you decide what action the target will take and where it will move during its next turn. Any suggested course of activity that is obvi-ously suicidal causes the spell to end on all the targets affected by it. Material Components: A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.
Maze					SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:8th-Level	DESC:As you incant this spell, you visualize a maze from which there is no escape. When you com-plete the casting, the creature you choose vanishes, banished into that labyrinth.	DESC:Choose a creature within range that you can see. You banish the target into an extra-dimensional labyrinth, a different plane of existence. The target remains there for the dura-tion or until it escapes the maze. To escape, the target must use its action to contest its Intelligence against your magic ability check (a minotaur automatically wins this con-test). On a success, the target escapes and the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the unoccupied space nearest its former space.
Meld into Stone			SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:8 hours					DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:Your spell renders a quantity of stone permeable, allowing you to merge with it, leaving no trace of your presence.	DESC:Choose a point on a stone object or sur-face large enough to fully contain your volume that you can touch. You can step into the stone at that point using your movement, melding your-self and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by non-magical senses. While merged with the stone, you cannot see what occurs outside it, and any ability checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the pas-sage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your move-ment to leave the stone, which ends the spell. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 6d6 bludg-eoning damage. The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals you 50 bludg-eoning damage. If expelled, you fall prone in an open space closest to where you first entered.
Melf's Acid Arrow			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:A shimmering, green arrow streaks toward your target and bursts in a spray of acid.	DESC:Make an attack roll against a target within range. You have a bonus to the roll equal to your magic ability modifier + your spellcasting bonus, if any. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 acid damage now and 3d6 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much damage. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial dam-age increases by 1d6 for each level above 2nd. Material Components: Powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach.
Mending				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 minute																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:cantrip When you cast this cantrip, your touch repairs small objects. You can fix a broken chain link, rejoin two halves of a broken key, mend a tear in a cloak or hood, or make a hole in a leather sack or a wineskin disappear.	DESC:Touch an object that is no larger than a 5-foot cube. A single break or tear in the object is mended, and any trace of the former damage is erased. An object with multiple breaks can be fixed with multiple applications of mending. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell cannot restore magic to such an object.
Meteor Swarm			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:1 mile								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:9th-Level	DESC:As you finish casting this spell, blazing balls of fire hurtle across the sky. They strike the ground like spears from heaven, with a deafening roar that fades to distant thunder.	DESC:Choose four points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius cloud centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The spell damages objects in the area and ig-nites flammable objects that are not being worn or carried.
Minor Illusion			SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:cantrip The fundamental building blocks of illusion-craft include this cantrip. With a barely perceptible waggle of your fingers, you create a sound or an image that other creatures can sense.	DESC:You create a ghost sound or a silent im-age within range that lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it (no action required) or cast this spell again. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a Wisdom check against your spell save DC. Ghost Sound: You create a sound that origi-nates from a point of your choice within range. The sound's volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. Silent Image: You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon at a spot within range. The illusion does not create sound or any other effect aside from its image. The image can be as large as a 10-foot cube. Any physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within 25 feet of you. As the image changes location, you can alter its appear-ance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking as you move it. Material Components: A bit of fleece.
Mirror Image			SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:1 minute					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:Two illusory duplicates step out of your body and take positions around you. When you move, the duplicates move with you, repeatedly merg-ing with and splitting from you to confuse your enemies about which one of you is real.	DESC:Two illusory duplicates of yourself ap-pear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your ac-tions. You can use your action to dismiss them. Each time a creature targets you with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature randomly determines whether it tar-gets you or one of the duplicates. If you have two duplicates, the creature targets a duplicate if it rolls 1-4 on a d6. If you have one duplicate, the creature targets a duplicate if it rolls 1-3 on a d6. A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and it uses your saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals hit point damage, the duplicate disappears. A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight or tremorsense.
Moonbeam				SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:A silvery beam of pale light shines down where you indicate with a gesture. Despite the light's softness, creatures caught in the radiance writhe in pain as ghostly flames erupt from those illu-minated.	DESC:Until the spell ends, dim light fills a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature that starts its turn in the light or enters the light for the first time during its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. Shapechangers make this saving throw with dis-advantage. A creature takes 3d8 radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. Shapechangers that fail the sav-ing throw also instantly revert back to their natural forms and cannot assume different forms until they leave the spell's light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 50 feet in any direction. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage in-creases by 1d8 for each level above 2nd.
Mordenkainen's Sword		SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:7th-Level	DESC:From the famed pen of the archmage Mor-denkainen of GREYHAWK, this spell lets you create a sword of crackling force that slashes and stabs furiously at any target you indicate. Requirement: You must have a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of cop-per and zinc. It costs 250 gp to construct and is not consumed by the spell.	DESC:You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When the sword appears, make an attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. The attack roll has a bonus equal to your magic ability modifier + your spellcasting bonus, if any. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. Once on each of your subsequent turns, you can direct the sword to move up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of it. Directing the sword requires no action, but you must be able to take actions.
Move Earth				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 2 hours	DESC:6th-Level	DESC:(ritual) Upon completing the incantation, you cause wavelike crests and troughs to appear and creep across the ground. Trees, structures, rock for-mations, and other surface features are mostly unaffected, except for changes in elevation and topography.	DESC:Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape earth, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes cannot exceed half the area's largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. At the end of every 10 minutes you spend con-centrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect. You can choose the same area of terrain multiple times to make more drastic changes to it. Because the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area cannot usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movement. This spell cannot manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unsta-ble, it might collapse. Similarly, this spell does not directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it. Material Components: A mixture of soils (clay, loam, and sand) in a small bag, and an iron blade.
Otto's Irresistible Dance	SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:8th-Level	DESC:The archmage Otto was a member of the Circle of Eight, a lover of fine food and music, and if his eponymous irresistible dance spell is any indica-tion, something of a practical joker. When you cast this spell, your hand motions mimic those of a cavorting fool as you command a creature to begin a comic dance: shuffling, foot tapping, and capering.	DESC:Choose one living creature within range that you can see. The target must make a Wis-dom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is not affected and your action is wasted, but you retain the spell. On a failed save, the tar-get must dance in place for the duration. A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disad-vantage on all saving throws. The only action a dancing creature can take is to make a Wisdom check against the spell's save DC to regain con-trol of itself. On a successful check, the spell ends. If you know and use the target's true name when you cast this spell, the enchantment in-stead lasts for 10 days, until you use your action to end the spell, or until the creature dies of ex-haustion.
Pass without Trace		SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:1 hour					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:(ritual) A deep connection to the natural world is re-quired to ask foliage, soil, and wildlife to forget that strangers recently passed through the area. When you cast this spell, you weave your desire to remain anonymous into your surroundings, and the world obliges by erasing all evidence of your passage.	DESC:Choose up to five willing creatures within range. For the duration, the creatures can move through any type of mundane terrain- mud, snow, dust, grassland, forest, or the like- and leave no physical evidence of their passage. If a creature affected by this spell makes an attack or casts a spell that affects anything but itself, this spell ends for that creature.
Passwall				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:1 hour					DESC:5th-Level	DESC:With a word and a gesture, you open a space in a wall to grant you passage.	DESC:Choose a point on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range. A passage appears at that point and lasts for the duration. You choose the open-ing's dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The opening creates no insta-bility in a structure surrounding it. When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space near-est to the surface on which you cast the spell. Casting this spell multiple times lets you create a deeper passage. Material Components: A pinch of sesame seeds.
Phantasmal Force			SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:The magic of fear and mental manipulation come together to create a phantasm, an illusion so powerful that it takes root in its victim's mind. A phantasm is visible only to the creature af-fected by it. Onlookers might assume that an invisible creature is on the loose.	DESC:Choose a living creature within range that you can see. The target must make a Wis-dom saving throw. On a failed save, you create an illusory object, creature, or other visible phe-nomenon of your choice that is visible only to the target for the duration. The illusion includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The illusion can occupy up to 500 cubic feet. A target affected by this spell can use its action to try to disbelieve the illusion. When it does so, it makes a Wisdom check against the spell's sav-ing throw DC. On a successful check, the spell ends. While a target is affected by the spell, it treats the phantasm as if it were real. It rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the illusion. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm will fall once it steps onto the bridge. If the crea-ture survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists, and comes up with some other ex-planation for its fall-it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. An affected target is so convinced of the phan-tasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phan-tasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, you can cause the phantasm to deal 1d6 damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of it. The damage is of a type appropriate to the illusion. A fire deals fire damage, a monster armed with a longsword deals slashing damage, and so on. Material Components: A bit of fleece.
Planar Ally				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:10 minutes-															RANGE:50 feet-								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:6th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You beseech your deity or planar patron to send an ally to aid you in your endeavors. When the potential ally appears, light, music, smoke, and other phenomena might accompany it as appro-priate for its kind. The spell merely calls the otherworldly creature; you must offer suitable payment in exchange for its aid.	DESC:Choose an otherworldly entity known to you, such as a god, an archfey, a primordial, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity causes a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a creature's true name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to call that creature. In that case, the creature can be of any type. When the creature appears, it acts normally (that is, under no compulsion to behave a certain way). You might ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services. Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a direct gift of treas-ure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a favor from you. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after report-ing back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. Some general guidelines about payments for tasks of a certain length follow. The DM can ad-just these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. . 100 gp per minute for a task taking up to 10 minutes . 1,000 gp per hour for a task taking up to 24 hours . 10,000 gp per day for a task taking up to 10 days Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially danger-ous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of your group, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.
Plane Shift				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:7th-Level	DESC:By infusing a tuning fork with magic and striking it to create a tone keyed to a particular plane, you create instantaneous passage from one plane of existence to another. You can use this spell to transport yourself and willing compan-ions, or banish a creature you touch. The spell can bridge any distance, allowing travel even to an entirely different reality. Requirement: You must have a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, inscribed with a sigil sequence attuned to a permanent teleportation circle on any plane of existence.	DESC:You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are shunted to an un-occupied space within the teleportation circle whose forked rod you used when you cast this spell. If the space is too small to hold all the crea-tures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle. You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature you can touch. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you touch the creature, which must then make a Charisma sav-ing throw. If the creature fails this save, it is shunted to an unoccupied space within the per-manent teleportation circle whose forked rod you used when you cast this spell. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.
Plant Growth			SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action or 8 hours														RANGE:150 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:(ritual) Channeling magical energy into normal plants causes them to grow and choke the area with dense jungle-like foliage.	DESC:If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that cannot be easily trav-ersed. A creature moving through the area must spend 15 extra feet of movement for every 5 feet it would travel. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected. If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants within range become en-riched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
Polymorph				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:4th-Level	DESC:When you cast this spell, you hold clear in your mind the images of both the target of your magic and of the living creature whose form you wish to impart. Your words mold the creature's cur-rent form into the new shape.	DESC:Choose a living creature within range that you can see. If the target is willing, you transform it. If the target is unwilling and its hit point max-imum is 150 or higher, or if it is a shapechanger, it is unaffected. If the target is unwilling and its hit point maximum is lower than 150, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you transform the creature. The transformation lasts for the duration. The new form can be any beast whose number of Hit Dice is equal to or less than that of the target. The target gains the capabilities and limitations of the new form, and loses the capabilities and limitations of its original form. But the target re-tains its current hit points, as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target continues to wear or carry any gear in its new form if that form is physically capable of doing so. Otherwise, the gear melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional until the spell ends. Material Components: An empty cocoon.

Prismatic Spray			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:7th-Level	DESC:When you cast this spell, you tear a hole in reali-ty's weave and direct the resulting spray of wild energy at foes. With a final slashing motion, you release a blast of warring colors that burn, freeze, or otherwise harm creatures caught within.	DESC:Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to determine which color affects it. 1. Red.

The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half that much damage on a successful one. 3. Yellow. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half that much dam-age on a successful one. 4. Green. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that much damage on a successful one. 5. Blue. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half that much damage on a suc-cessful one. 6. Indigo. On a failed save, the target is re-strained. At the start of your next turn, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails that save, the creature turns to stone. A creature turned to stone by this spell is stunned and has resistance to all damage. If it is physically broken or damaged while in this state, the creature suf-fers from similar damage or deformities when it reverts to its original state. 7. Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw; a successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the crea-ture is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing. 8. White. On a failed save, the target is blinded for 1 minute. Additionally, roll the d8 again until you get a result other than 8, and apply that ef-fect to the target as well.

DESC:You touch a willing creature and choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The target has resistance to that dam-age type for the duration.
Protection from Evil		SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:1 minute					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:With incense and sprinkled holy water, you ward your subject against evil spirits and influences.	DESC:You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, that creature has advantage on saving throws against effects created by fiends and un-dead, and cannot be charmed or frightened by such creatures. Material Components: Holy water and in-cense.
Protection from Poison		SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:1 hour					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:With a mystic utterance and a touch, you drive poison out of a creature and guard it from other toxins.	DESC:You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poi-son afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random. For the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against poison, and it has re-sistance against poison damage.
Purify Food and Drink		SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:1st-Level	DESC:(ritual) Your incantation purifies spoiled, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water, making it suitable for consumption.

Raise Dead				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 hour																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:5th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You recall the willing soul of a recently dead creature, reuniting it with its body so the crea-ture lives once more. Requirement: You must have a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which is consumed by the spell.	DESC:You touch a creature that has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to return, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the crea-ture at the time it died. This spell does not, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these are not first removed pri-or to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it does not restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its sur-vival-its head, for instance-the spell automatically fails. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, sav-ing throws, and checks. Every time the target completes a long rest, the penalty is lessened by 1 until it disappears.
Ray of Enfeeblement		SCHOOL:Necromancy		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:You impale a creature on a black beam of dark energy. The ray drains away the target's strength leaving it weakened until it can shake off its ef-fects.	DESC:Make an attack roll against a living creature within range.

On a hit, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls based on Strength or Dexterity, and it can deal no more than 1 damage with such an attack.

At Higher Levels: The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach a caster level of 5th (2d8), 10th (3d8), 15th (4d8), and 20th (5d8).
Read Magic				SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:10 minutes				DESC:cantrip Spellcasters are often jealous of their lore. To guard their secrets, they use secret alphabets and ciphers to record their spells. When you cast this spell, incomprehensible magical symbols waver, change position, then suddenly become clear, allowing you to peruse the magical writing with ease.	DESC:Choose an object within range. For the duration, you can decipher magical writing on that object that would otherwise be unintelligi-ble, including a spell from someone else's spellbook, a spell on a scroll, a line of mystical script on a magic weapon, and the like. Decipher-ing this writing does not normally invoke the magic contained in it. Once a particular magical inscription is deci-phered by means of this spell, the inscription continues to be intelligible to you. You can also identify the names of specific magic glyphs and symbols using read magic, though not their function. Material Components: A clear crystal or a mineral prism worth at least 5 gp, which is not consumed by the spell.
Regenerate				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 minute																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:1 hour					DESC:7th-Level	DESC:(ritual) Your magic stimulates a creature's natural heal-ing ability so that wounds close, broken bones knit, and severed extremities regrow.	DESC:You touch a living creature. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points and then 1 hit point per minute for the duration. Any limbs the creature is lacking are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed extremi-ty and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
Remove Curse			SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:(ritual) You unravel a curse's power, freeing a creature or an object from its fell influence.	DESC:You touch one creature or object. All curses affecting it end, unless the object is a mag-ic weapon, a shield, or a suit of armor. Such an item retains its curse, but the person wearing or holding the cursed item can remove or drop it.
Resistance				SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:1 minute					DESC:cantrip You imbue a creature with protective energy that protects it from harm by twisting fate in a subtle, but perhaps lifesaving, way.	DESC:You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, that creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It may choose to roll the die before or after rolling the d20. The spell then ends. The spell ends early if you cast it again before the duration has passed. Material Components: A miniature cloak.
Resurrection			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 hour																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:7th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You channel positive energy into the deceased to restore it to life. The creature shudders, gasps for air, and rises, shaking off all effects of death. Requirement: You must have a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which is consumed by the spell.	DESC:You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, that did not die of old age, and that is not undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points. This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It does not, however, remove magical dis-eases, curses, and the like; if such effects are not removed prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life. This spell closes all mortal wounds and re-stores any missing body parts. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, sav-ing throws, and checks. Every time the target completes a long rest, the penalty is lessened by 1 until it disappears. Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you complete a long rest, you cannot cast spells again, and you have disad-vantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Rope Trick				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:1 hour					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:Your magic raises a length of rope into the air.

DESC:You touch a length of rope that is up to 50 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space holds as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space. Creatures in the extradimensional space are on another plane of existence. Attacks and spells cannot cross through the entrance into the space, but those in the space can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. Material Components: Powdered corn ex-tract and a twisted loop of parchment.

Sanctuary				SCHOOL:Abjuration		CASTTIME:Swift																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:Healers sometimes cast sanctuary on themselves so they can cast curative spells without the risk of interference from their foes. The spell is also useful for keeping an important person safe while a battle rages.	DESC:Choose a creature within range. Until the spell ends, anyone who targets that creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. Sanctuary doesn't protect the chosen creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fire- ball. If the chosen creature makes an attack or casts a harmful spell, this spell ends early.
Scorching Ray			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:This spell causes rays of searing fire to erupt from your hand.	DESC:You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make an attack roll for each ray.

Scrying				SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:10 minutes															RANGE:Self									DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:5th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You fix your mind on your reflection as it ap-pears on the surface of your spell focus. As the magic takes hold, mists swirl around your re-flected features until they suddenly clear, revealing a creature you sought, as well as its immediate surroundings.	DESC:Choose a creature on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wis-dom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. On a successful save, the target is not affected, and you cannot use this spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can per-ceive through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. Material Components: A focus worth at least 1,000 gp, either a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water.
Seeming				SCHOOL:Illusion		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:12 hours					DESC:5th-Level	DESC:You weave a large illusion to mask the appear-ance of yourself and several other creatures.	DESC:You change the appearance of any number of willing creatures within range that you can see. The spell disguises physical appear-ance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the ex-tent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dis-miss it sooner. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, ob-jects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of some-one who reaches out to touch you would bump into something while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that a target is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the target and make a Wisdom check against the spell's saving throw DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the tar-get is disguised.

DESC:Choose a point within range. No sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point for the du-ration. Creatures within the area of silence are deafened.
Sleep					SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:1st-Level	DESC:The fine sand you fling into the air sparkles when this spell's magic takes hold. Creatures touched by the scintillating granules grow drowsy and might fall asleep.	DESC:Choose a point within range, and roll 4d8. The total is how many hit points of living creatures this spell can affect. Each creature to be affected must be within 20 feet of the point you chose. The spell ignores any creature that is unconscious. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before mov-ing on to the creature with the next lowest hit points.

DESC:Choose up to six creatures in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration. An affected target's speed is halved. Addition-ally, the target takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can either move or take an action on its turn, not both. Material Components: A drop of molasses.

For as long as your magic holds the spirit to its body, it must answer the questions you put to it.	DESC:Choose a corpse within range. The corpse must still have a mouth, not be an undead creature, and not have been the target of this spell within the last 7 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. An-swers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. This spell does not return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse cannot learn new information, does not comprehend anything that has happened since it died, nor can it speculate about future events.
Spider Climb			SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:The gesticulations you make while casting this spell mimic the actions of a spider climbing an imaginary wall.

If the creature is being held in the air, out of contact with the ground or another surface ca-pable of supporting it, you automatically maintain your grip when you try to do so, and you can move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, as long as you don't move it farther than 50 feet from you. If the creature in your grip can get purchase on an immovable surface or is Large or larger, you must engage it in another contest. If the creature wins the contest, the spell ends. Object: You can use your action to select an object within 50 feet of you that you want to manipulate. If you do so, the spell works as if you had targeted a creature, with the following ex-ceptions: . You automatically affect an object weighing 300 pounds or less that is not being worn or carried. . If the object is held, worn, or carried by a crea-ture, you must make a check with your magic ability contested by that creature's Strength check. . You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.
Teleport				SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:7th-Level	DESC:(ritual) Permanent teleportation circles are safe end-points for teleport spells. However, those who master and cast greater teleport fling caution to the wind and attempt to teleport to any location. As you cast this spell, you envision the location where you want to appear, attempting to imag-ine it clearly in your mind. When you finish the spell, the air around you seems to catch fire as you and your chosen companions are instantly whisked elsewhere.	DESC:Choose up to five willing creatures within range. You and each creature you chose are instantly transported from your current loca-tion to a destination that is known to you on the same plane of existence. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. Roll d100 and consult the ta-ble. Familiarity: "Permanent circle" means a per-manent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Very familiar" is a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. "Studied carefully" is a location you know well, because you have been there often or you have used other means to study the place. "Seen casu-ally" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map. "False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are at-tempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. When traveling to a false destina-tion, you roll 1d20 + 80 rather than d100, since there is no real destination for you to arrive at or be off target from. "Associated object" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wiz-ard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb, or the like. On Target: You and your group appear where you want to. Off Target: You and your group appear a ran-dom distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 I? 1d10%% of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15%%, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off tar-get randomly by rolling a d8. On a 1, north; 2, northeast; 3, east; 4, southeast; 5, south; 6, southwest; 7, west; 8, northwest. If you were tel-eporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area: You wind up in an area that's vis-ually or thematically similar to the target area. A wizard heading for her home laboratory, for ex-ample, might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up any-where on the plane. Mishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you are assaulted by the spell's magic. You each take 1d10 force damage, and you reroll on the table to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80 instead of d100. Each time this result comes up, you take another 1d10 force damage and reroll.
Teleportation Circle		SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 minute																RANGE:10 feet								DURATION:1 round					DESC:5th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You draw a circle of sigils on the ground to link your location to a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you have learned. Many major temples, guilds, and other places of import have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Upon casting the spell, a shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open long enough for you and your companions to step through and appear safely at the destination you chose. A sigil sequence is a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. Each location in the world and beyond has a unique sigil se-quence. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn two sigil sequences to desti-nations determined by the Dungeon Master. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil se-quence to memory after studying it for a minute.	DESC:You inscribe a 10-foot circle on the ground. Choose a permanent teleportation circle on the same plane of existence as a destination. A shimmering portal then opens inside your cir-cle and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instant-ly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space. You can create a permanent teleportation cir-cle by casting this spell every day for one year in one location. You need not use the circle to tele-port when you cast the spell in this way.
Thaumaturgy				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:Up to 1 minute				DESC:cantrip You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of divine power.	DESC:You create one of the following effects within range. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can end any of those effects early (no action required). . You magnify the sound of your voice to boom up to three times as loud as normal for 1 mi-nute. . You cause flames to flicker, sputter, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute. . You cause faint, benign tremors in the ground for 1 minute. . You instantaneously cause thin glass objects to crack or cloth or parchment to smoke and singe. The object must be nonmagical. . You create an instantaneous sound that origi-nates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of an owl or raven, or ominous whispers. . You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut. . You turn your eyes solid black, solid white, or alter the appearance of your eyes in some oth-er way for 1 minute.
Thunderwave				SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:15 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:1st-Level	DESC:You evoke a whip-crack of thunder, creating a wave of energy that can sweep aside creatures and objects it contacts.	DESC:Each creature in a 15-foot cube origi-nating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful one, it takes half as much damage and is not pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are com-pletely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's ef-fect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible within 300 feet of you. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6.
Time Stop				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:9th-Level	DESC:White-hot sparks spray from your blurring fin-gers, eroding the fabric of space and time. While the spell persists, you can take several actions as, all around you, everything else stands frozen in time.	DESC:You stop time for yourself for the dura-tion. During this period, you can use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period affects a creature other than you (including casting spells that summon other creatures) or affects an object being worn or car-ried by someone other than you, or if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast this spell.
Trap the Soul			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Permanent				DESC:8th-Level	DESC:You ensnare a creature's essence and trap it in-side a gem. Requirement: You must provide a gemstone worth at least 1,000 gp for each Hit Die of the creature you would trap.	DESC:Choose a creature within range that you can see. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you force the tar-get's soul into the gemstone. While its soul is so trapped, the target's body and all the equipment it is carrying cease to exist. The gem holds the target indefinitely or until the gem is broken, at which time the target's body re-forms in an unoccupied space nearest to the gem and in the same state as when this spell was cast on it. You, and you alone, can communicate telepath-ically with the trapped soul. Other creatures that inspect the gemstone see a tiny figure inside it. If you speak the target's true name when you cast the spell, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.
True Resurrection			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 hour																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:9th-Level	DESC:(ritual) You beseech the powers of the cosmos to inter-cede on behalf of a creature you believe to have been wrongly slain, restoring life to the dead creature. Requirement: You must provide an offering of treasure worth at least 25,000 gp, which is con-sumed when you cast this spell.	DESC:You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points. This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell re-places damaged or missing organs and limbs. The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. It then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.
True Seeing				SCHOOL:Divination		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Touch									DURATION:1 hour					DESC:5th-Level	DESC:(ritual) A creature affected by this spell sees with perfect clarity, able to pierce darkness, illusions, and even transmutations to perceive things as they truly are.	DESC:You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the creature can see things as they actually are out to a range of 120 feet. The crea-ture sees in normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees invis-ible creatures, automatically detects visual illusions and succeeds on saving throws against them, and perceives the true forms of creatures affected by transmutation spells. Furthermore, the target can see into the Ethereal Plane. Material Components: An ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp and is made from mush-room powder, saffron, and fat.
Wall of Fire			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:4th-Level	DESC:When you evoke wall of fire, you visualize the Elemental Plane of Fire. The blazing plane's ground is ever-shifting plates of compressed flame, the air a continual firestorm, and its seas and rivers boiling magma. With a rippling wave of your hand, you draw up from the ground a vertical sheet of flame, which burns as hot as that blazing plane.	DESC:You create a wall of fire on a solid sur-face within range. You can choose to make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts for the duration, and it heavily obscures creatures behind it. One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature within 10 feet of that side. The wall deals this damage when it appears. A creature also takes this damage if it ends its turn inside the wall, if it ends its turn within 10 feet of the wall's damaging side, or if it passes through the wall (but no more than once per turn). The other side of the wall deals no damage. If you create the wall on top of a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage as if it passed through the wall. On a success, the creature can move 5 feet so that it is not in the fire. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage in-creases by 1d8 for each level above 4th. Material Components: A small piece of phos-phorus.
Wall of Stone			SCHOOL:Evocation		CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:5th-Level	DESC:Drawing material from the Elemental Plane of Earth, you bring a wall of solid stone into exist-ence, shaping it in whatever way you choose. Typically, casters use this spell to close passages, portals, and breaches against opponents.	DESC:A nonmagical stone wall springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6-inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. You can double the size of each panel by halving its thickness or double its thickness by halving the size of each panel. The wall can have any shape you desire, though it cannot occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall need not be vertical, nor rest on any firm foundation. It must, howev-er, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. The wall can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 5, and it has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. The wall is immune to acid, cold, fire, necrotic, psychic, and radiant damage, and is also immune to any effect that requires an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points or fewer de-stroys it and may cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion. Material Components: A small block of gran-ite.
Wall of Thorns			SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:100 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:6th-Level	DESC:You conjure a thorn bush with your spell, which sprouts into a long barrier of tough, pliable, tan-gled brush that bristles with needle-sharp thorns, each as long as a human's finger.	DESC:You create a wall of thorns within range on a solid surface. You choose to make the wall up to 50-feet long, 10-feet high, and 5-feet thick or a circle that has a 25-foot radius and is up to 20 feet high and 5-feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration, and it blocks line of sight. Crea-tures you designate when you cast the spell are not affected by it. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly. For every 5 feet a creature would travel through the wall, it must spend 20 feet of move-ment. Furthermore, any creature that enters the wall's space must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 slashing damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. If you create the wall on top of a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7d8 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature can move 5 feet so that it is not in the wall. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a level higher than 6th, the wall's length increases by 10 feet or the size of its radi-us increases by 5 feet and the damage increases by 1d8 for each level above 6th.
Water Breathing			SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:8 hours					DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:Those who live on dry land instinctively fear the deeps. Mastering this spell requires that the caster face and overcome these fears. When you cast this spell, the suggestion of gills appears on each affected creature's neck, and the creature gains the ability to breathe underwater for extended periods.	DESC:Choose up to ten willing creatures within range. In addition to retaining its normal mode of respiration, each creature can now breathe underwater until the spell ends. Material Components: A short reed or piece of straw.
Water Walk				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:1 hour					DESC:3rd-Level	DESC:You touch one or more creatures to enable them to walk across liquids, such as acid, water, mud, snow, quicksand, ice, and lava, as if they were on solid ground. In the case of dangerous liquids, the spell does not protect a creature from envi-ronmental effects the liquids cause.	DESC:Choose up to ten willing creatures within range. Until the spell ends, each target can move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground. If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.
Web					SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour	DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:You conjure a mass of thick webbing that chokes a corridor, a chamber, a small grove of trees, or any place where such a web can be anchored.	DESC:Choose a point within range. A 20-foot radius centered on that point fills with sticky webs for the duration. The webs are difficult ter-rain and lightly obscure their area. If the webs are not anchored between two sol-id masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them for the first time during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer re-strained. The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot-cube of webs exposed to fire burns away at the start of your next turn. The fire spreads 5 feet at the end of each turn until the web burns away. Any crea-ture that starts its turn in an area of burning webs takes 2d4 fire damage. Material Components: A bit of spiderweb.
Wind Walk				SCHOOL:Transmutation	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:25 feet								DURATION:8 hours					DESC:6th-Level	DESC:Your spell transforms the creatures you touch into wispy and insubstantial shapes. They rise into the air and fly like clouds.	DESC:You and up to 10 willing creatures within range gain the ability to assume a cloud form at will for the duration. While in a cloud form, a creature has a fly speed equal to half its normal speed, and has re-sistance against damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are to hustle or to resume its normal form. A creature flying while in this form ap-pears to be nothing more than a wisp of cloud. If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, it descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it cannot land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.
Wish					SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:Self									DURATION:Instantaneous				DESC:9th-Level	DESC:Your arcane knowledge has advanced so far that you're able to glimpse the foundations of reality itself. You have come to understand that every spell evokes just a minuscule fraction of that ul-timate formula. Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality in accord with your desires.	DESC:The basic use of this spell is to dupli-cate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You do not need to meet any requirements. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can achieve any one of the following effects. . Create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that is not a magic item. . Create one common, uncommon, or rare magic item. . Allow up to twenty creatures to regain all hit points and end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell. . Grant up to ten creatures immunity to a dam-age type, a magical effect, or some other effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack. . Undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (includ-ing your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit, a friend's failed save, and so on. You must accept the re-sult of the reroll, even if it is less favorable to you than the original roll. You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. Your DM has a lot of latitude in ruling what oc-curs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. Either the spell simply fails, the effect you desire is only partly achieved, or you suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how the wish was worded. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weak-ens you. Until you complete a long rest, you lose the ability to cast spells. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it is not 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
Zone of Truth			SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action																RANGE:50 feet								DURATION:1 minute					DESC:2nd-Level	DESC:(ritual) You create a magical zone that guards against deception. Creatures affected by the zone's mag-ic cannot knowingly speak a lie.	DESC:Choose a point within range. Until the spell ends, any creature that enters a 15-foot ra-dius centered on that point or that starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature cannot speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. An affected creature is aware of the spell and may thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a crea-ture can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
