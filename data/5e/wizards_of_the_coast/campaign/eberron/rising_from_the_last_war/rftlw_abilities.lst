Magical Tinkering			KEY:Artificer ~ Magical Tinkering				SOURCEPAGE:p.56					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L01a0	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have tinker's tools or other artisan's tools  in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice: The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 fe et. • Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a re­corded message  that  can be heard up to  10 fe et away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. • The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to  10 feet away. • A static visual effect appears on  one  of the object's sur­faces.  This effect can be a picture, up to  25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this fe ature, though a single  object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this fe ature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your max­imum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies. 
Spellcasting			KEY:Artificer ~ Spellcasting					SOURCEPAGE:p.56					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L01a1	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders using mundane items or out­landish inventions. TOOLS REQUIRED You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5,  "Equipment," in  the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools. After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.
Cantrips				KEY:Artificer ~ Cantrips					SOURCEPAGE:p.56					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L01a2	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:(0-LEVEL SPELLS) At 1st level, you know two can trips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

Preparing And Casting Spells	KEY:Artificer ~ Preparing And Casting Spells		SOURCEPAGE:p.56					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L01a3	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of artificer spells that are avail­able for you to  cast,  choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an In­telligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a  1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting fo­cuses: at least 1  minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Infusing An Item			KEY:Artificer ~ Infusing An Item				SOURCEPAGE:p.57					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L02a2	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see "Attunement" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one. You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.
Tool Expertise			KEY:Artificer ~ Tool Expertise				SOURCEPAGE:p.57					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L06a0	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Spell-Storing Item		KEY:Artificer ~ Spell-Storing Item				SOURCEPAGE:p.58					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L11a0	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared). While holding the object, a cre??ture can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.
Magic Item Savant			KEY:Artificer ~ Magic Item Savant				SOURCEPAGE:p.58					SORTKEY:Class Artificer L14a0	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Artificer Class Feature.Class Feature.SpecialQuality			DESC:At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more: You can attune to up to five magic items at once.

Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present. The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+O). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action. When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.	DESC:&nl;Flamethrower - The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against you r spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.	DESC:&nl;Force Ballista - Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon. The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice with in 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to ld8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +l).

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.
