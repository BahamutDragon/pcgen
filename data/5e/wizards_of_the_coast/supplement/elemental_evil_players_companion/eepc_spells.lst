The restrained creature can use an action to try to break free by succeeding on a Strength check (DC 20) or by dealing 25 damage to the rock around it. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface to an unoccupied space.
Vitriolic Sphere							SOURCEPAGE:p.23	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Spell	SCHOOL:evocation	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:150 feet	COMPS:V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)	DURATION:Instantaneous	DESC:You point at a place within range, and a glowing 1-foot ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.
Wall Of Sand							SOURCEPAGE:p.23	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Spell	SCHOOL:evocation	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:90 feet	COMPS:V, S, M (a handful of sand)	DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:You conjure up a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, and it vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line of sight but not movement. A creature is blinded while in the wall's space and must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves there.
Wall Of Water							SOURCEPAGE:p.23	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Spell	SCHOOL:evocation	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:60 feet	COMPS:V, S, M (a drop of water)	DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:You conjure up a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain. Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.
Warding Wind							SOURCEPAGE:p.23	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Spell	SCHOOL:evocation	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Self	COMPS:V	DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes	DESC:A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration. The wind has the following effects: • It deafens you and other creatures in its area. • It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller. • The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. • The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disad- vantage if they pass in or out of the wind. • It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
Watery Sphere							SOURCEPAGE:p.23	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Spell	SCHOOL:conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:90 feet	COMPS:V, S, M (a droplet of water)	DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:You conjure up a sphere of water with a 10-foot radius on a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover in the air, but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space outside it. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw. The sphere can restrain a maximum of four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature in excess of these numbers, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it. As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet over ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw, but no more than once per turn. When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls.
Whirlwind							SOURCEPAGE:p.24	TYPE:Arcane.Divine.Spell	SCHOOL:evocation	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:300 feet	COMPS:V, M (a piece of straw)	DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute	DESC:A whirlwind howls down to a point on the ground you specify. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone. A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 x 10 feet away from it in a random direction.
