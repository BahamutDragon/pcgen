BONUS:VAR|Attunement_Mind_Lash|1		SPROP:Not attuned to Item|!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Attunement,Mind Lash	SPROP:In the hands of a creature other than a mind flayer, a mind lash functions as a normal whip. In the hands of an illithid, this magic weapon strips away a creature's will to survive as it also strips away flesh, dealing an extra 2d4 psychic damage to any target it hits. Any creature that takes psychic damage from the mind lash must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.|PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Attunement,Mind Lash

SURVIVAL MANTLE	TYPE:Mind Flayer Augmentation.Armor		SPROP:This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor. A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases (such as those created by a cloudkill spell, a stinking cloud spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
