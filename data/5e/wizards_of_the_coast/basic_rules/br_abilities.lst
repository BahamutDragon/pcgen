Blindsight	CATEGORY:Special Ability			DESC:A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.
Darkvision	CATEGORY:Special Ability			DESC:Many creatures in the worlds of D&D, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Truesight	CATEGORY:Special Ability			DESC:A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

# Damage Types
# Acid			. The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.
# Bludgeoning		. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.
# Cold			. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.
# Fire		. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.
# Force		. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.
# Lightning	. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.
# Necrotic	. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and some spells, withers matter and even the soul.
# Piercing	. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.
# Poison	. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.
# Psychic	. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage.
# Radiant	. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
# Slashing	. Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.
# Thunder	. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.
Signature Spells					KEY:Wizard ~ Signature Spells								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC: When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.

#Arcane Traditions	 The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.
School of Evocation	KEY:Arcane Tradition ~ School of Evocation		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Wizard Arcane Tradition.SpecialQuality	DESC: You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.
