Darkfur Ratfolk		DESC:Darkfur ratfolk are cynical like their windfoot counterparts, and just as introverted, but they have a knack for blending into society. They prefer to live on the fringes of the island nation's cities. Many disdain authority, but simply attempt to keep away from law enforcement, believing they will be left alone if they leave others alone. The dark hair on their bodes gives them an advantage in dark environs.

Windfoot Ratfolk		DESC:Windfoot ratfolk fit well the rebellious nature of their race; they have no love for civilization and laws, preferring the freedom and unpredictability of the wild. Most windfoot ratfolk are cautious and untrusting of others who come near their territory, but they have keen eyes and quick feet, giving them a distinct advantage when they get the drop on their enemies.
