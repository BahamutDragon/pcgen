Eldritch Toxin		KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Eldritch Toxin			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this martial archetype, you learn the challenger’s mark* , poison spray, reaver’s touch*, and resistance cantrips, you gain proficiency with poisoner’s kits, and you learn an additional Primal Rite for your Crimson Rite feature, the Rite of the Fang, described below: Rite of the Fang: Your rite damage is poison type.
Envenomed Ki		KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Envenomed Ki			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, you have gained martial training comparable to that of a monk, and have studied ki, the mysterious elemental energy that suffuses living things. Though you cannot truly master ki the way a monk can, you can use it for a limited number of effects, which is represented by gaining a limited number of ki points. You have a number of ki points equal to half your Blood Hunter level (rounded up). These ki points are regained whenever you finish a short or long rest. You can spend ki points to use the following abilities: • You can spend 1 ki point to take the dash action as a bonus action. When you spend 1 ki point for this, until the end of your turn, you also gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed, and gain advantage on Dexterity checks and Strength (Athletics) checks. • As a reaction whenever you would take damage, you can spend 1 ki point to give yourself resistance to poison and necrotic damage until the end of your next turn. • You can spend 2 ki points to cast one of the following spells, using the normal casting time required for that spell, without the need for any material components: create poison*, detect poison and disease, lesser restoration, or protection from poison. You gain more of these spell-like abilities as you gain levels. At 11th level, you can spend 5 ki points to cast greater invisibility, lesser water to poison* or vampiric touch. At 17th level, you can spend 6 ki points to cast greater water to poison* or contagion. In addition, if you have 2 or fewer ki points when you roll initiative, you immediately gain 1 ki point.
Miasma of Contamination	KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Miasma of Contamination	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 3rd level, your spells and attacks treat immunity to poison damage as if it were only resistance to poison damage. Poison damage that your attacks and spells would inflict on Fey, Fiends, and Undead is automatically converted to acid damage if that would increase the amount of damage the creature takes. When you reach 7th level, once on your turn, when you inflict poison damage with an unarmed attack or with a weapon that is imbued with your Crimson Rite, you can (as part of the same action) force the creature taking the poison damage to roll a Constitution save. If the creature fails, it is poisoned until the beginning of your next turn.
Poisonous Body		KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Poisonous Body			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 7th level, your body produces powerful poisons that are as much a part of you as your blood or tears. You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on all saves against the poisoned condition. In addition, when you make an unarmed attack on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause your unarmed attacks to inflict 1d4 poison damage instead of the normal amount of bludgeoning damage until the beginning of your next turn. While this effect is active, you can use your Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, as long as you are not wearing heavy armor. This increasingly poisonous nature of your body alienates you from others. Whenever you have less than half your maximum hit points, your skin takes on a sinister, unhealthy looking pallor with hints of purple or blue, giving you disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks. This effect ends immediately when you regain enough hit points to have more than half or your maximum hit points.
Advanced Ki Control	KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Advanced Ki Control		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Starting at 11th level, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of spells you cast with your Corrupted Ki feature, provided the spell has an enhanced effect at higher level (as create poison* does). The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. The maximum number of ki points you can spend in this way (including the base cost of the spell and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is equal to 1+ your proficiency bonus.
Living Poison		KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Living Poison			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Beginning at 11th level, you can exude poison from your very flesh. You are immune to poison damage, and if a creature touches you continuously for more than 2 rounds, or if it succeeds in a grappling you, you can spend 1 ki point without using an action to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, it only takes poison damage equal to half your blood hunter level. On a failed save, it takes poison damage equal to your blood hunter level and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. At 15th level, when you successfully grapple a creature, you can use this ability against them as a reaction. This ability comes with a price. Any friendly creature with which you make skin-to-skin contact lasting more than a minute must make a Constitution saving throw immediately once they have not been in contact with you for over an hour. If they fail, their Constitution score is reduced by 1d4, and they must make another Constitution save whenever they finish a long rest, reducing their Constitution by an additional 1d4 whenever they fail. Success on any Constitution save against the effect ends it immediately, though reduced Constitution must be regained normally. If a creature under this effect makes skin-to-skin contact lasting more than a minute with you again, you can spend 1 ki point to cause their next saving throw against this effect to be made at advantage.
Lingering Venom		KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Lingering Venom			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 15th level, you have an absolute mastery of the poison within you. You are immune to the poisoned condition, and when an opponent fails its saving throw against your Living Poison feature two rounds in a row, you can spend 3 ki points as a reaction to infect it with an unnoticeable lingering poison, which lasts for a number of days equal to your blood hunter level. This lingering poison is harmless unless you choose to activate it. To do so. you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails. it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 5d8 poison damage and 5d8 necrotic damage. You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to expend the lingering poison harmlessly without using an action. If you touch the corpse of a humanoid you have killed with this ability, you can choose for it to rise at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.
Ki Reversal			KEY:Order Of The Venomblooded ~ Ki Reversal			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:Class	TYPE:Blood Hunter Class Feature.Class Feature.Order Of The Venomblooded.SpecialQuality	SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:At 18th level, you can disrupt your own ki to reverse the flow of ki in another’s body entirely. You can spend 7 ki points to cast finger of death, but the range of the spell is reduced to 5 ft., and when you do so, you must instantly spend three of your own Hit Dice, but you do not regain any hit points from spending them.
