Abiding Webs	CLASSES:Sorcerer,Wizard=4	INFO:SpellLevel|4	SCHOOL:conjuration	COMPS:V, S, M (spider and a bit of webbing frozen in amber)	CASTTIME:1 action	DURATION:Permanent	RANGE:100 ft.	TARGETAREA:Cube, 20 ft. square	SAVEINFO:Dex / avoids	DESC:You create a 20-foot cube of sticky webs at a point you can see. Abiding webs works identically to web, except as noted otherwise. These webs are crawling with tiny, harmless spiders. Damage to the web is repaired by the spiders that live in it, at the rate of one 5-foot cube per round (125 cubic feet; the entire volume of the webs can be sixteen times this size). This repair occurs on initiative count 20. If the webs are completely destroyed, the spell ends. The spiders themselves are immortal and need neither air nor food to survive; the magic of the spell produces more spiders as needed.

#		CASTTIME:1 hour
#		DURATION:Permanent
#		RANGE:Touch
#		TARGETAREA:1 object weighing up to 1 lb.
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You cause a small object of up to a pound in weight to sink harmlessly into the flesh of the target. Magical rings, amulets, or other items melded in this way still give their benefits to the wearer as if they were being worn. A slight warping of the flesh and a magical aura are the only clues to the item's existence. Items carried in this way are considered attuned to the recipient and count toward the limit of how many items can be attuned. If the creature is already at the limit, the spell fails to take effect. If absorb object is dispelled or otherwise ends early, the object tears itself free of its recipient, doing 2d8 piercing damage in the process. The original spell-caster can end the spell as an action, causing the item to be expelled harmlessly.

#		SAVEINFO:Wis / negates effect
#		DESC:You cause liquids carried by a creature to dry up. All nonmagical liquid (water, alcohol, lamp oil) evaporates instantly unless the target creature makes a successful Wisdom saving throw. In addition, three potions carried by the target will also be affected by this spell. If the target carries more than three potions, the three that dry up are selected randomly. Absorption has no direct effect on living (or unliving) creatures or plants, only on liquids they carry.

#		SAVEINFO:Dex / half damage
#		DESC:A blast of caustic acid erupts from your fingers. Every creature in the cone takes 6d8 acid damage, or half damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail their saving throw also take an additional 2d8 acid damage at the end of their next turn. Enhancement: For each spell slot used higher than 6th level, the subsequent damage increases by 1d8.

#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You create a caustic downpour of acid in a cylindrical area with a 20- foot radius, 30 feet high, extending downward from a point you can see. For the duration, each creature that starts its turn in the area or enters the area takes 5d8 acid damage. Even after leaving the area, a creature is still coated with the acid and continues taking 2d8 acid damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature can use an action to rinse off the acid if it has water, vinegar, or another suitable substance available. All ongoing damage ends when the spell ends. The acid can also damage objects in the affected area, but the extent of this damage must be determined by the GM.

#		TARGETAREA:Up to 100 ft. by 100 ft. by 20 ft. of water
#		SAVEINFO:Con / half damage
#		DESC:You transform a normal body of water into a pool of thick, bubbling acid. The spell affects an area up to 100 ft. by 100 feet by 20 feet deep. The acid is black and opaque and reeks of sulfur. Anyone splashed by the acid takes 2d6 acid damage. A creature that starts its turn in the acid or that enters the acid takes 10d6 acid damage, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.

#		SAVEINFO:Con / half damage, no blindness
#		DESC:You call forth a breeze full of stinging acid droplets from your outstretched hand. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 acid damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. Enhancement: For each spell slot used higher than 1st level, the damage increases by 1d6.

#		COMPS:V, S, M (acorns)
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:24 hours
#		RANGE:Touch
#		TARGETAREA:6 acorns
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:As part of casting this spell, you throw up to six acorns, which take root and rapidly grow into adult trees where they land. The acorns can be thrown up to 60 feet. They can all be thrown in the same direction, or in different directions. They must land in fertile ground (not on bare rock or a wooden floor, for example) for the spell to be effective, and they must have enough space to grow. You have a special bond with this grove; it grants you tactical advantage on saving throws you make within 30 feet of one of the trees. This benefit ends if all of the trees are destroyed. The trees shrink back into acorns when the spell ends.

#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:One skeleton that you touch gains immunity to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from nonmagical weapons that are not made of adamantine, and resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from magical weapons that are not made of adamantine. Enhancement: For each spell slot used higher than 6th level, you can affect one additional skeleton.

#		TARGETAREA:1 creature
#		SAVEINFO:Con / negates effect
#		DESC:You touch a creature, and that creature becomes cursed with age unless is makes a successful Constitution saving throw. The creature becomes wizened and enfeebled and has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution-based ability checks, attack rolls, skill rolls, and saving throws. It does half damage with weapon attacks. This effect can be ended by magic that removes curses.
#	Aerial Pilot
#		INFO:SpellLevel|3
#		SCHOOL:conjuration
#	Wizard
#		COMPS:V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:12 hours
#		RANGE:60 ft.
#		TARGETAREA:1 summoned creature
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You summon an invisible creature capable of steering and navigating any vessel competently. It follows simple instructions you give it regarding the bearing and speed of the vessel. Treat the creature as if it had a +6 bonus to relevant ability checks when performing its duties. The creature has AC 10, 1 hit point, Strength 10, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
#	Aetheric Shield
#		INFO:SpellLevel|4
#		SCHOOL:abjuration
#	Wizard
#		COMPS:V, S, M (a glass lens)
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 minute
#		RANGE:30 ft.
#		TARGETAREA:1 lens, 10-ft. diameter
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You conjure an aetheric lens, 10 feet wide, within 30 feet of you. The lens protects those behind it from magic; any spell of 4th level or lower that requires a clear path through the lens is stopped entirely. The lens doesn't interfere with spells you cast, and it doesn't block area effects. For example, a fireball couldn't be aimed directly through the lens, but if it was set off immediately in front of the lens, the blast would still affect people on the other side of the lens and within the fireball's radius. You can spend a bonus action to move the lens to any point within 30 feet of you. Enhancement: If aetheric shield is cast using a spell slot higher than 4th level, the lens protects against spells of equal or lower level than the spell slot you used.
#	Affect Normal Fog
#		INFO:SpellLevel|1
#		SCHOOL:transmutation
#	Druid
#		COMPS:V, S, M (a tiny candle and a small horn)
#		CASTTIME:1 action

#		RANGE:120 ft.
#		TARGETAREA:1,000 cubic ft.
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You can manipulate a normal fog bank of up to 1,000 cubic feet you can see within range. The fog can be gathered into a thick mass of opaque fog, creating a heavily obscured area, or dispersed to create an area of patchy fog that lightly obscures its area. Magically-created fog can't be affected by this spell.
#	Agitate Crowd
#		INFO:SpellLevel|7
#		SCHOOL:enchantment
#	Bard
#		COMPS:V, S
#		CASTTIME:10 minutes
#		DURATION:8 hours
#		RANGE:Self
#		TARGETAREA:Sphere, 60-ft. radius
#		SAVEINFO:Wis / negates effect
#	# 12
#		DESC:This spell enables you to sway a large group of people toward accomplishing a specific goal. You must speak emphatically on the subject for 10 minutes, playing on the crowd's emotions and reason, to inflame their fervor for or against a cause or person. You must be clear about the specific goal you want to achieve. For example, shouting that "The Academy of Wizards is evil and corrupt!" might make people dislike the academy, but it won't spur them to action because it doesn't tell them what to do. Adding "Follow me, and we'll burn it to the ground!" will send a crowd of torch-bearing arsonists to the academy tower. The spell affects all sentient creatures that are able to hear and understand you within 60 feet. When you finish casting the spell, all potential targets of the spell who fail a Wisdom saving throw are compelled to follow your instructions for the duration of the spell, as long as those orders are in keeping with the goal stated in the speech and you personally lead them. If these conditions aren't met, the spell ends and the crowd becomes hostile toward you. The spell also ends when the goal has been achieved.
#	Air Breathing
#		INFO:SpellLevel|3
#		SCHOOL:transmutation (ritual)
#	Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard
#		COMPS:V, S, M (a sliver of copper)
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:24 hours
#		RANGE:30 ft.

#	Cleric, Druid, Wizard
#		COMPS:V, S, M (a tiny model bridge)
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:10 minutes
#		RANGE:120 ft.
#		TARGETAREA:1 bridge, 60 ft. long, 10 ft. wide
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You create an invisible bridge up to 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that connects two points of your choosing. Both ends of the bridge must be within the spell's range, and both must be solid objects that can support the weight of whatever physical objects cross the bridge. The bridge itself has no weight. Anyone can cross this bridge while it exists, provided they know where it is. Enhancement: When you cast air bridge using a slot of 5th level or higher, the bridge is substantial only to those you nominate; to all others, it does not exist. This is also true if you cast the spell as a ritual and are capable of casting 5th level spells.
#	Air Forge
#		INFO:SpellLevel|2
#		SCHOOL:transmutation (ritual)
#	Cleric, Druid, Wizard
#		COMPS:V, S
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:8 hours
#		RANGE:30 ft.
#		TARGETAREA:2 cubic ft. of air
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You heat a patch of air to the great temperatures of a forge. You can hold up metal to that area and soften it just as a real forge would and then work the metal appropriately. Only items placed in the heated area by the caster are affected; the heat doesn't affect anything else, and it can't be felt by living creatures at all. This spell, along with a portable anvil, greatly lessens the difficulty for a craftsman repairing equipment in the field. Enhancement: If air forge is cast using a spell slot higher than 2nd level, it heats a number of cubic feet of air equal to the spell slot used.

#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:The spell creates a 5-foot-radius sphere of pure, fresh air that forms around you and moves with you. The spell keeps out hazardous gases and water, but solid objects can pass into the sphere. The air remains pure and clean for the duration of the spell.

#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes.

#		TARGETAREA:1 fire
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You cause an existing fire of Medium or smaller size to reduce in size and light to that of a match, or increase in brightness - but not size - to that of a light spell. Reducing a fire also reduces its consumption of fuel by half, with the effect of doubling its remaining duration, while increasing a fire doubles its fuel consumption. This spell doesn't change the heat output of the fire.
#	Alter Scent
#		INFO:SpellLevel|1
#		SCHOOL:transmutation
#	Druid, Ranger
#		COMPS:V, S
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:Concentration, up to 1 hour

#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:12 hours
#		RANGE:Touch
#		TARGETAREA:1 anchor
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You create an anchor and chain of pure force that attach to a ship and maintain its position against current and strong wind. Creatures aboard the ship can raise the anchor by using an action to touch the chain and command it, and they can lower the anchor the same way. The anchor disappears when the spell ends.

#		TARGETAREA:1 creature
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:One willing creature you touch is blessed with the protective qualities of angels. For the duration of the spell, the target creature gains resistance to radiant damage and to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It also has tactical advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:1 hour
#		RANGE:Touch
#		TARGETAREA:Self plus 1, 2, or 3 other creatures
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:This spell allows you and up to three more willing creatures to take on the appearance of any one species of beast of CR 1 or less, but only to members of that species. All creatures of that species perceive affected creatures not only as their own kind but also as members of their own pack, herd, flock, or group. The spell does not guarantee safety; affected creatures might still be challenged as rivals for mates or dominance, but such challenges are no more severe than they would be for a genuine rival beast.
#	Annihilate Soul
#		INFO:SpellLevel|9
#		SCHOOL:necromancy
#	Cleric
#		COMPS:V, S, M (a glass figurine worth 1,000 gp, which is consumed by the spell)
#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:Instantaneous (see text)
#		RANGE:30 ft.
#		TARGETAREA:1 living creature
#		SAVEINFO:Con / half damage
#		DESC:This spell unleashes magic that rips the soul from a living creature you can see. The target takes 8d6 + 50 necrotic damage, or half damage if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points after failing the saving throw against this spell, it dies and its soul shatters into 2d6 spirit shards that take up residence in random life forms in a 10-mile radius. The spirit shards prefer intelligent creatures over unintelligent ones. The creatures that become hosts to these shards are unaware of their presence, but they can start having strange dreams and displaying odd habits picked up from the soul shard. Each shardbearer also gains proficiency in one random skill possessed by the original creature; if they already are proficient in the skill, they become expert in the skill, and if already expert, they gain tactical advantage on all uses of that skill. The original creature can't be resurrected unless all bearers of shards are gathered into the same area before the resurrection magic is used; shard-bearers lose all benefits gained from the spirit shards at that time. If a shard-bearer dies, the spirit shard transfers to another creature within 10 miles.

#		RANGE:60 ft.
#		TARGETAREA:1 creature
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You point at a creature and disrupt the ether around it. For the duration of arcane censure, the creature can't cast spells or use innate spellcasting. As an action, it can make an ability check using its spellcasting ability against your spell saving throw DC. A successful save ends the arcane censure's effect.
#	Arcane Obstruction

#		CASTTIME:1 action
#		DURATION:Concentration, up to 10 minutes
#		RANGE:Self
#		TARGETAREA:Sphere, 50-ft. radius
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You create an aura in a 50-foot radius around yourself that is antithetical to arcane magic. Arcane spellcasters in the sphere require additional time to cast their spells: spells that take a bonus action to cast now require 1 action; 1 action increases to 1 round; and other spells have their casting times doubled. The sphere of effect moves with you.

#		TARGETAREA:Sphere, 30-ft. radius
#		SAVEINFO:Con / half damage
#		DESC:You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of unstable magic centered on a point you can see. For the duration of the spell, any creature casting an arcane spell within the area of the sphere takes 6d6 fire damage, or half damage with a successful Constitution saving throw, as their casting ignites the magic of your spell.

#		TARGETAREA:1 creature
#		SAVEINFO:None
#		DESC:You hurl a spear made of magical force at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If it hits, the spear does 3d10 force damage. If the target is a spellcaster, the hit also wipes out one of its available, lowest-level spell slots as if the spell had been expended. Enhancement: For each spell slot used higher than 3rd level, damage increases by 1d10. When you cast arcane spear using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, a hit also wipes out two of the target's spell slots instead of one.

A creature can only hold one aspect tattoo at a time; scribing another eliminates the previous one. The animal being represented must be present when the aspect tattoo is created. The recipient of the tattoo can activate the tattoo's effect as a bonus action. Once the tattoo is scribed, it remains until the effect is activated. The known tattoos are as follows: • Badger: The recipient goes into a battle frenzy, gaining tactical advantage on melee attacks for 1 minute. • Bear: The recipient's Strength score increases to 19 for 10 minutes. • Cheetah: The recipient's speed increases to 60 feet for 1 minute, and opportunity attacks against the recipient have tactical disadvantage. • Panther: The recipient gains tactical advantage on Stealth checks for 10 minutes. Other animal tattoos could be discovered that grant different powers.

#		TARGETAREA:Up to 1,200 sq. ft.
#		SAVEINFO:Dex / half damage
#		DESC:When you cast this spell, rocks, boulders, and other large stones are summoned from the Elemental Plane of Earth and rain down on the area of effect, which can be up to 1,200 square feet (twelve 10-by-10-foot squares). The area can be laid out as you wish, but it must be contiguous, at least 10 feet across at every point, entirely within the spell's range, and entirely within your line of sight. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature takes 8d8 bludgeoning damage, falls prone, and is restrained beneath boulders until they escape or the stones disappear. A successful save means the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone or restrained. A restrained creature can escape from under the boulders by using an action and making a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell saving throw DC. The stones remain on the ground for 1 minute after they fall, making the area difficult terrain and providing plenty of places to find cover.

#	Each creature that fails the saving throw associates the person with the

#	compels her to forget that image. But if the person with the dagger is still

A dying creature must make a Constitution saving throw; a successful save negates the effect for that creature, but a failure results in the creature dying immediately as its blood erupts from inside it. Each tentacle has AC 15, 10 hit points, reach 5 ft., and your saving throw modifiers. At the beginning of your turn, each tentacle attacks one creature within 10 feet of it using your spell attack bonus. You choose the targets if you can see the tentacles; otherwise they attack the closest creature, friend or foe. A successful hit does 1d8 + 4 bludgeoning damage and the target creature is grappled. A tentacle doesn't attack any other target while it's grappling a creature. A grappled creature can't breathe, and is suffocating. A creature can escape from a tentacle by using an action and making a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. Tentacles disappear when they are reduced to 0 hit points. If no enemies are in reach, the tentacles retreat inside their hosts and remain dormant until a creature approaches. The tentacles never attack you.

#	The creature you touch when you cast this spell is filled with the deep
#	chill of evil. The targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If
#	the saving throw fails, the creature's compassion is stripped away and it
#	becomes cruel and paranoid for the duration of the spell.
#	This is a subtle effect calling for adjudication by the GM. The affected
#	creature doesn't go berserk or turn into a serial murderer. Most often,
#	this spell causes the affected creature's normal acts to become twisted
#	perversions of their original intent. For example, a noble knight afflicted
#	by the chill of evil might decide that defeating his opponent honorably on
#	the field of battle isn't enough "justice" for the harm that opponent caused.
#	Instead, that foe must be "purified" through pain, so the knight imprisons
#	him and tortures him to death over the week of the spell's duration. An artist
#	could turn to portraying only evil or grisly subjects in his paintings, and a
#	merchant might suddenly start hawking poisons on the street. Essentially,
#	the affected creature acts as if its alignment is aggressively Neutral Evil; it
#	greedily seeks its own interests with no regard for how others are hurt. If the
#	creature was Evil to begin with, this might not be much of a change.
#	People who know the target well can make a Wisdom (Insight) check to
#	determine why the person is acting so uncharacteristically.
#	Chill of evil is most often used by evil clerics against paladins and good
#	clerics. Their victims are likely to fall from grace for the duration of the
#	spell at least, and their reputations might be ruined for far longer. The
#	target of the spell recalls everything after it ends. Since the person doesn't
#	necessarily know they were enchanted, a Good character is likely to feel
#	tremendous remorse over his or her actions.

#	You attempt to contact the spirit of a specific dead entity by name. The

#	compel the spirit to appear before you. This spell is most useful in the
#	Underworld or another realm where finding one shade among countless
#	hosts of the dead can be nigh impossible. The spell conveys your call to
#	the shade you desire, along with your location and a sense of urgency. The
#	shade is under no obligation to respond, but most do simply to break the
#	eternal tedium of death. If the shade chooses to answer your call in the
#	Underworld, it arrives within ten minutes. If you are somewhere else, the
#	shade arrives within 24 hours.
#	If cast within the Underworld, the spell's range is unlimited. If cast from
#	the material world or any other plane, the site of the spirit's death must
#	be on the same plane and within the spell's range of the caster. Note that
#	the range refers to the site of the creature's death, not its current location.
#	This spell can also be used to contact an intelligent undead creature
#	within range; for example, it could contact the spirit of a drowned sailor if
#	cast within a mile of the site of the drowning.
#	Note that this spell does not alter the subject's personality or willingness
#	to help you. Once the target spirit arrives, you must persuade it to help
#	through negotiation, payment, or coercion of some sort. Family members,
#	loved ones, friends, and slain companions are more inclined to help than
#	are strangers or someone who was killed by the caster. Another spell,
#	such as speak with dead, might be needed to compel answers from an
#	uncooperative or unresponsive shade.

#	Second, any attempt to use magnetism within the area of effect (to

#	unless the opposed magnetic field is generated by a spell of level 4 or higher.
#	Third, any electrical current (magical or otherwise) that passes within

#		SAVEINFO:See text
#	You cause the air to vibrate with music concentrated in a wall up to
#	80 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet wide. The wall forms in an area you
#	choose within range. It must be straight along its entire length. Creatures
#	in the area occupied by the wall when it's created make Dexterity saving
#	throws. A successful saving throw indicates the creature can immediately
#	move to an adjacent unoccupied space; if the saving throw fails or the
#	creature has nowhere to go, the wall forms around it. The wall doesn't
#	obscure vision or block movement physically.
#	When you cast the spell, you choose whether the song is melodious or
#	cacophonous.
#	The melodious song causes one side of the wall that you choose to emit
#	a pleasing melody that entrances those that can hear it; the other side is
#	silent. Every creature within 30 feet of the melodious side of the wall that
#	can hear the song must make a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of
#	each of its turns. If the saving throw fails, the creature must move toward
#	the wall by the shortest, safest route until it is within the wall.
#	A creature that enters the melodious wall or ends its turn inside it must
#	make a Wisdom saving throw. If this saving throw fails, the creature
#	falls unconscious for as long as it's inside the wall. If it takes damage, it
#	can repeat the saving throw; it awakens on a successful save. A creature
#	never needs to make more than one saving throw against the wall's
#	effect per turn.
#	The cacophonous song causes one side of the wall to emit thunderous,
#	damaging vibrations while the other side remains silent. Each creature that
#	ends its turn within 30 feet of the wall takes 3d8 thunder damage and is
#	deafened until the start of its next turn, or half damage with no deafening
#	if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. Being unable to hear
#	the wall doesn't protect a creature against the damage, which is caused by
#	vibrations affecting the creature's whole body.
#	The interior of the cacophonous wall is even more dangerous; any
#	creature that enters the wall or ends its turn there must make a Constitution
#	saving throw (no more than one saving throw per turn). If the saving throw
#	fails, the creature takes 8d6 thunder damage, is permanently deafened,
#	and is stunned until the beginning of its next turn. A successful save halves
#	the damage and the creature is not deafened or stunned. Creatures that are
#	already deaf are immune to the stunning but still take the damage.

#	This spell allows you to inflict wracking pains on a fiend, usually in

#	To cast this spell, you must have a specially prepared document that

#	When you begin reading the document, the subject feels great
