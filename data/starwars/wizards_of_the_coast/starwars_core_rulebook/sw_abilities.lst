Bonus Class Skill		KEY:Noble Class Feature ~ Bonus Class Skill	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Noble Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Fringer Bonus Class Skill|1	DESC:At 1st level, a noble may designate any one cross-class skill (except for a Force-related skill) as a class skill. This represents an area of expertise the noble picks up outside his or her normal training.
Favor				KEY:Noble Class Feature ~ Favor			CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Noble Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	DESC:The noble has the ability to call in favors from those she knows. By make a favor check, the noble can call upon contacts to gain important information without going through the time and trouble of doing a lot of research. Favors can also be used to acquire the loan of equipment or documents from influential acquaintances. To call in a favor, the noble makes a favor check. Roll a d20 and add the character’s favor bonus (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, and so on). The GM sets the DC based on the scope of the favor being requested. The DC ranges from 10 for a simple favor being requested to as high as 25 for highly dangerous, expensive, or illegal favors. The noble can’t take 10 or take 20 on this check, nor can she retry for the same (or virtually the same) favor. Note that favors should help advance the plot of an adventure. A favor that would enable a character to circumvent an adventure should always be unavailable to the character, regardless of the result of a favor check. A noble can try to call in a favor a number of times in a week of game time that’s equal to half her noble levels, rounded down (minimum of one). So, as a 1st-level noble, Arani can attempt to call in a single favor, while as a 7th-level noble she can attempt to call in favors as many as three times from different contacts. The GM should carefully monitor the noble’s use of favors to ensure that this ability isn’t abused. The success or failure of a mission shouldn’t hinge on the use of a favor, and calling in favors shouldn’t replace good roleplaying or the use of other skills. The GM may disallow any favor deemed to be disruptive to the game (see favors and contacts for additional information on this).
Inspire Confidence	KEY:Noble Class Feature ~ Inspire Confidence	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Noble Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	DESC:Beginning at 2nd level, a noble can use oratory to inspire confidence in allies, bolstering them and improving their chances of success. An ally must listen to and observe the noble for a full round for the inspiration to take hold. The effect lasts for 5 rounds. The noble can inspire a number of allies equal to half her noble levels, rounded up. She can inspire confidence once per day for every four levels of noble she possesses (once per day from 1st to 4th level, twice per day from 5th to 8th level, and so on).  An ally inspired with confidence gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.  The noble can’t inspire confidence in herself. The ability only aids her allies.
Resource Access		KEY:Noble Class Feature ~ Resource Access		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Noble Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:Beginning at 3rd level, a noble has access to an array of resources (usually from family, influential friends, or patrons). Once per day, the noble can make a Charisma check to use those resources during the adventure. The value of resources gained equals the noble’s class level multiplied by the result of the Charisma check multiplied by 20. Thus, a 3rd-level noble who gets a result of 16 on her Charisma check would gain 960 credits’ worth of resources to use in the adventure (3 x 16 x 20 = 960). These resources can take almost any form the noble chooses (within reason) and are hers to do with as she pleases. She can keep them, use them, give them away, or sell them as she sees fit. The resources gained arrive in the noble’s possession 1d8 hours after she makes the check. These resources must be reasonably available when and where she chooses to make the check. For instance, a noble trekking through the wilderness of Endor’s forest moon won’t have access to many resources. Resource access tends to be monetary, whereas favors tend to be benefits that can’t necessarily be measured in credits.
Coordinate			KEY:Noble Class Feature ~ Coordinate		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Noble Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:A noble has a knack for getting people to work together. When the noble can aid others and give directions, she provides a bonus to the task at hand by making an aid another check. This bonus is in addition to the normal aid another bonus of +2 (see aiding others), and it increases as the noble gains levels. So, the noble provides a total +3 bonus at 4th level (+2 aid another bonus, +1 cooperation bonus), a +4 bonus at 8th level, etc. This ability can’t be used to assist in combat.

This feat must be selected from the following list, and the noble must meet any prerequisites. Diplomatic Immunity, Fame, Frightful Presence, Influence, Mimic, Persuasive, Sharp-Eyed, Trustworthy
Inspire Greatness		KEY:Noble Class Feature ~ Inspire Greatness	CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Noble Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.44	DESC:Beginning at 11th level, a noble can inspire greatness in an ally, granting extra fighting capability. This works similar to inspire confidence, except it affects but a single ally. An ally inspired with greatness gains +2d6 temporary vitality points, a +2 competence bonus on attacks, and a +2 morale bonus to saving throws. The effect lasts for 5 rounds. The noble can inspire greatness once per day. For every three noble levels attained beyond 11th level, the noble can inspire greatness in one additional ally. The noble can’t inspire greatness in herself. The ability only aids her allies.

Therefore, starting at 2nd level, the scoundrel can reroll any failed ability check, skill check, attack roll, or saving throw. (In other words, any task resolution die roll, which are die rolls using a d20.) The second result must be used regardless of whether it is better or worse than the first. The scoundrel can use this ability a number of times per day, depending on his level, but only once in any given encounter. At 2nd level, the scoundrel can use lucky once per day; at 18th level, he can use it up to four times in a day (but only once in any encounter).

When traveling in poor conditions or difficult terrain, the scout may make a Survival check to reduce travel time. With a check result of 15 or better, the scout reduces the total travel time by 25%%. With a 25 or better, the time is reduced by 50%%. The scout can guide a group of up ot three individuals at no penalty. However, for each additional three in the group being guided, apply a -2 penalty to the trailblazing check.

Because of this, once per day the scout can focus his will and gain a circumstance bonus based on his innate belief in himself and his abilities. The bonus ranges from +1 at 3rd level to +4 at 18th level. The bonus can be applied to any skill check, ability check, or attack roll.

Uncanny Dodge		KEY:Scout Class Feature ~ Uncanny Dodge		CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Scout Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.49															DESC:Starting at 4th level, the scout gains the extraordinary ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. At 4th level and above, the scout retains his Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by a hidden attacker. (He still loses his Dexterity bonus to Defense if immobilized.) This aspect of uncanny dodge does not negate flank attacks. At 7th level, the scout can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of himself as easily as he can react to a single attacker.

Each time, the tech specialist selects a specialty from among those described below. It can be a different specialty each time, or the tech specialist can choose the same specialty as many as three times over the course of the six selections. &nl;Computer Specialist: Receive a +1 bonus on Computer Use checks. Additional selections of this tech specialty can improve the bonus to +2 and +3.&nl;Mastercrafter: Applying this specialty to a specific Craft skill allows you to build mastercraft items using that skill. The type of items that can be mastercrafted, and the relevant Craft skill for each type, are as follows. On average, it takes twice as long to construct a mastercraft item as it does to create an ordinary item of the same sort: You must pay double the cost for raw materials (2/3 of the item’s normal price rather than 1/3), and the result of every daily Craft check you make is halved (round down). You can add the mastercraft feature to an existing ordinary item by paying the raw material cost and then making daily Craft checks as though you were constructing the item itself. In addition to the cost of raw materials, the tech specialist must also pay a number of experience points based on the mastercraft bonus being applied: 40 XP for a +1 bonus, 160 XP for a +2 bonus, and 360 XP for a +3 bonus. These experience points must be paid along with the raw materials cost, before the character makes any daily Craft checks to create the mastercraft item. If the expenditure of these XP would drop the character’s total below the minimum needed for his or her current level, then the XP cannot be paid (and the mastercraft work cannot be begun) until the character gains enough additional XP to remain at his current level after the expenditure is made. Creating a mastercraft item is a task of extreme complexity; as such, the DC of the final Craft check to complete the item is 20. When successfully completed, a mastercraft item provides a +1 bonus to the quality of an ordinary item of the same type. For more information, see Mastercraft Items. &nl;Additional selections of this tech specialty can give a character the ability to make items with +2 and +3 bonuses. To make a +2 item, a tech specialist needs to start with a +1 item, paying the monetary and XP costs appropriate to that item. Similarly, to make a +3 item, the character needs to start with a +2 item. &nl;Mechanic: Receive a +1 bonus on Repair checks. Additional selections of this tech specialty can improve the bonus to +2 and +3. &nl;Medical Specialist: Receive a +1 bonus on Treat Injury checks.

Deflect (Defense)					KEY:Jedi Consular Class Feature ~ Deflect (Defense)				CATEGORY:Class Feature	TYPE:Class Feature.Jedi Consular Class Feature.Display	SOURCEPAGE:p.57			DESC:A Jedi learns to deflect blaster bolts and other projectiles with his lightsaber, thereby providing a dodge bonus to Defense against such attacks. You must be carrying an active lightsaber to use this special ability. Deflecting an attack is a reaction that costs the Jedi a move action in his next round. The Jedi must indicate he is using Deflect (Defense) when an opponent declares an attack against him, but before any attack rolls are made. When used in this fashion, the Jedi gains the dodge bonus against all ranged attacks directed at him in the round. For example, if Sen Udo-Mal uses his activated lightsaber to deflect any number of blaster attacks in round three of combat, in round four Sen Udo-mal loses a move action to account for the effort expended to deflect the attacks in round three. Each time the Jedi gains Deflect (Defense), it provides a +1 dodge bonus to Defense when he uses his lightsaber to block ranged attacks. Deflect (Defense) can be used in conjunction with total defense for even greater protection, providing the dodge bonus for deflecting the attack and the +4 dodge bonus granted by using total defense. In this case, Deflect (Defense) isn’t a reaction; it’s an attack action used in a round when the Jedi expects to come under heavy fire.

(The type of blaster determines the range increment.) You must be carrying an activated lightsaber to use this special ability. Deflecting and redirecting an attack is a reaction that cost the Jedi a move action in his next round. The Jedi must indicate that his is using his Deflect (Attack) when an opponent declares an attack against him but before any attack rolls are made. Deflect (Defense) and Deflect (Attack) can be used together in the same round (though the Jedi can decide not to use the defense if he wants a better chance of redirecting the incoming attack). The Jedi can deflect and redirect a number of attacks equal to one-half his Jedi level, rounded up. The redirected attack must miss the Jedi by 5 or less; any attack that hits the Jedi or misses by 6 or more points can’t be redirected. If the Jedi can redirect the attack, the Jedi immediately rolls an attack roll using his lightsaber attack bonus and applying a – 4 penalty as described below. If this roll is high enough to hit the target, the redirected attack deals damage to the target (the type of blaster determines the damage dealt by a redirected attack). Each time the Jedi gains Deflect (Attack), the penalty associated with the redirected attack is lessened by 1.
