###Block: Avenging Executioner
24
Bloody Blade (Ex): The fury of your attack is terrifying to see. Whenever you deal sudden strike damage (see below) with a melee weapon, the target of the sudden strike and all opponents within 30 feet of you who can see the target are shaken for a number of rounds equal to your avenging executioner level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + your avenging executioner level + your Cha modifier) negates this effect. Creatures whose HD exceed your character level are not affected. Bloody blade is a mind-affecting fear ability.


25
Sudden Strike (Ex): If you can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage. See the ninja's sudden strike class feature in the sidebar below.
Rapid Intimidation (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you can attempt to demoralize an opponent as a move action instead of a standard action. See the Intimidate skill (PH 77) for details. If you have the favored enemy class feature, you can add your favored enemy bonus to Intimidate checks made to demoralize foes of the chosen type (and subtype, if applicable).
Dread Blade (Ex): Starting at 4th level, you can exploit the terror you inspire to further brutalize your target. You treat shaken, frightened, or panicked creatures as flat-footed for the purpose of dealing sudden strike damage.
Bloody Murder (Ex): Starting at 5th level, if you deal enough damage with a melee attack to drop a creature (typically by reducing it to below 0 hit points or killing it), all enemies within 30 feet of you who can see the target become frightened for 1 round. A successful Will save (DC 10 + your avenging executioner level + your Cha modifier) lessens the effect to shaken. Creatures whose HD exceed your character level are not affected. Bloody murder is a mind-affecting fear ability.




###Block: Battle Trickster
28
Bonus Trick: At 1st level, and again at 3rd level, you gain a bonus skill trick for which you meet the prerequisite. These bonus tricks do not cost skill points and do not count against your maximum number of skill tricks available.
Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, you gain a bonus feat for which you meet the prerequisite. This feat must be selected from the list of fighter bonus feats.
Tricky Fighting (Ex): At 3rd level, you have mastered incorporating skill tricks into your combat routines. In any round when you perform a skill trick, you gain a +1 competence bonus on the next attack roll you make that round.


###Block: Cloaked Dancer
31
Enchanting Dance (Su): Once per day per cloaked dancer level, you can use your dance to produce supernatural effects on those who observe you. Each ability requires both a minimum cloaked dancer level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform (dance) skill to qualify; if you do not have the required number of ranks, you do not gain the enchanting dance ability until you acquire them. This ability can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. Enchanting dance is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Starting an enchanting dance effect is a standard action. You must concentrate each round to maintain the dance; no dance can be maintained for more rounds than your cloaked dancer level + your Con modifier (minimum 1 round). The save DC for your enchanting dance effects is 10 + your cloaked dancer level + your Cha modifier. A creature can't be affected again by your enchanting dance effect for 24 hours whether or not it succeeds on the saving throw.
#
Beguiling Dance: A cloaked dancer with 10 or more ranks in Perform (dance) can use her enchanting dance to distract her enemies. Whenever you start or maintain a beguiling dance, all enemies within 30 feet who can see you must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Creatures that fail this save also have their attitude improved by one step for as long as you maintain the dance (see Influencing NPC Attitudes, PH 74). This attitude adjustment does not prevent any subsequent attitude changes. For example, an enemy that becomes indifferent toward you as a result of this effect still turns hostile if you then attack it.
Wearying Dance: A 3rd-level cloaked dancer with 12 or more ranks in Perform (dance) can use her enchanting dance to tire her enemies. Whenever you start or maintain a wearying dance, all enemies within 30 feet who can see you must succeed on a Will save or be fatigued for as long as you maintain the dance. Creatures failing this save that are already fatigued become exhausted.


32
Frightful Dance: A 5th-level cloaked dancer with 14 or more ranks in Perform (dance) can use her enchanting dance to scare her enemies. Whenever you start or maintain a frightful dance, all enemies within 30 feet who can see you must succeed on a Will save or be shaken for as long as you maintain the dance. Creatures failing this save that are already shaken become frightened, and those that are already frightened become panicked.
#
Surprise Strike (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you can make a particularly effective attack against creatures distracted by your dance. As a full-round action, you can maintain your enchanting dance and make a melee attack with a light weapon, dealing an extra 1d6 points of damage. At 4th level, the extra damage you deal increases to 2d6. The extra damage from the surprise strike ability stacks with the extra damage from sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target. A target under the effect of your enchanting dance is considered flat-footed against the attack. Any creature that is not vulnerable to extra damage from sneak attacks is immune to this effect. This ability counts as sudden strike for the purpose of meeting prerequisites or using ambush feats (page 71).
