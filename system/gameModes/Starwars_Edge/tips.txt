<b>Welcome to PCGen!</b><br>If you ever need help, hit F1 or see the Documentation in the Help menu. The Character Creation Walkthrough is a great place to start.
The "Things to be Done" list in the bottom left of the Summary tab will guide you on what needs to be done for your character. You can even click on an item to be taken to the appropriate tab and field. 
PCGen supports a huge range of source books. Some of the most popular combinations have been set up for you in the Basic list of sources. However you can always create your own combinations on the Advanced sources tab and click Save Source Selection so they show up on the Basic list for you next time. 
Use the <em>File > Export</em> or <em>File > Print</em> menus to output great character sheets. We support HTML and PDF output as well as output to files which can be loaded into real time tools.
Using the Qualified toggle buttons on each tab will trim the list down to just the options that you can take.
The Affordable toggle button on the Purchase tab only shows those items you have the funds for.
Here be Monsters!<p>PCGen makes it easy to create monsters too. Just load up a source which includes monsters and then create a new character. You can either: <UL><LI>Click on the <em>Create Monsters</em> button to make one just like in the book; or</LI><LI>Select a monster race and make up the monster like you would a normal character.</LI</UL>
